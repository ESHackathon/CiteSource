AB  - Worldwide, artificially armored shorelines can dominate available estuarine habitat. Increases in artificial substrata in southern California, USA, coincide with increased abundances of nonindigenous species. The US west coast Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, may be particularly sensitive to changes in natural habitat availability and recently experienced large-scale declines in abundance. Simultaneously, the non-indigenous and often invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has been introduced along the US West Coast, including into southern California estuaries where its impact is unstudied. We recorded C. gigas and O. lurida densities from October 2010 through July 2017 throughout southern California on several habitat types and as a function of tidal elevation as a critical baseline for evaluating impacts of C. gigas. Ostrea lurida was present in higher proportions than C. gigas in hard substrate-dominated habitats, whether natural or human-introduced. A strong zonation pattern emerged; C. gigas achieved its maximum density above +0.4 m MLLW versus O. lurida at or below +0.2 m MLLW. These data reveal the optimal tidal elevation for placement of a restored O. lurida bed and establish a critical baseline and techniques for evaluating future changes in oyster density.

AB  - Worldwide, artificial reefs are being installed to simultaneously attract recreational divers and protect deteriorating natural reefs. This study uses a bibliometric review of artificial coral reefs to identify five clusters as gate criteria for artificial reef design. These clusters enable the conceptualization and testing of artificial reefs for optimum integration of sociotechnical requirements, biological integrity, and ecological marine health. The five clusters are: (1) applications, solutions, and performance; (2) management, technology, and science; (3) calcification, biomineralization, chemistry, and ocean acidification; (4) coral species survival, mortality, and photosynthesis; and (5) artificial reef development, and coral and fish recruitment. The six biomimicry design stages are: define, biologize, discover, abstract, emulate, and evaluate. The 3D printing and hard corals design attracted a large number of planula larvae and different inhabitant corals, and a high species diversity in the surrounding waters. Practical implications include biomimicry-based means for coral reef restoration and recreational ecosystem services.

AB  - Wooden fences are applied as a nature-based solution to support mangrove restoration along mangrove coasts in general and the Mekong Delta coast in particular. The simple structure uses vertical bamboo poles as a frame to store horizontal bamboo and tree branches (brushwood). Fence resistance is quantitatively determined by the drag coefficient exerted by the fence material on the flow; however, the behaviour of drag is predictable only when the arrangement of the cylinders is homogeneous. Therefore, for more arbitrary arrangements, the Darcy-Forchheimer equations need to be considered. In this study, the law of fluid flow was applied by forcing a constant flow of water through the fence material and measuring the loss of hydraulic pressure over a fence thickness. Fences, mainly using bamboo sticks, were installed with model-scale and full-scale diameters applying two main arrangements, inhomogeneous and staggered. Our empirical findings led to several conclusions. The bulk drag coefficient (CD) is influenced by the flow regime represented by Reynolds number. The drag coefficient decreases with the increase of the porosity, which strongly depends on fence arrangements. Finally, the Forchheimer coefficients can be linked to the drag coefficient through a related porosity parameter at high turbulent conditions. The staggered arrangement is well-predicted by the Ergun-relations for the Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients when an inhomogeneous arrangement with equal porosity and diameter leads to a large drag and flow resistance.

AB  - Within intertidal communities, aerial exposure (emergence during the tidal cycle) generates strong vertical zonation patterns with distinct growth boundaries regulated by physiological and external stressors. Forecasted accelerations in sea-level rise (SLR) will shift the position of these critical boundaries in ways we cannot yet fully predict, but landward migration will be impaired by coastal development, amplifying the importance of foundation species' ability to maintain their position relative to rising sea levels via vertical growth. Here we show the effects of emergence on vertical oyster-reef growth by determining the conditions at which intertidal reefs thrive and the sharp boundaries where reefs fail, which shift with changes in sea level. We found that oyster reef growth is unimodal relative to emergence, with greatest growth rates occurring between 20-40% exposure, and zero-growth boundaries at 10% and 55% exposures. Notably, along the lower growth boundary (10%), increased rates of SLR would outpace reef accretion, thereby reducing the depth range of substrate suitable for reef maintenance and formation, and exacerbating habitat loss along developed shorelines. Our results identify where, within intertidal areas, constructed or natural oyster reefs will persist and function best as green infrastructure to enhance coastal resiliency under conditions of accelerating SLR.

AB  - With sea level rise, erosion, and human disturbances affecting coastal areas, strategies to protect and stabilize existing shorelines are needed. One popular solution to stabilize while conserving intertidal habitat is the use of “living shoreline” techniques which are designed to mimic natural shoreline communities by using native plants and animals. However, little information is available on the success of living shoreline stabilization. This project evaluated the wave energy attenuation associated with living shorelines that contained Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and/or Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) in a wave tank. Four living shoreline techniques were assessed, including a control (sediment only), oysters alone, cordgrass alone, and a combination of oysters plus cordgrass. Time since deployment (newly deployed, one-year after deployment) was also assessed to see how wave energy attenuation changed with natural oyster recruitment and plant growth. Wave energy was calculated for each newly deployed and one-year old shoreline stabilization treatment using capacitance wave gauges and generated waves that were representative of boat wakes in Mosquito Lagoon, a shallow-water estuary in Florida. All one-year old treatments attenuated significantly more energy than newly-deployed treatments. The combination of one-year old S. alterniflora plus live C. virginica was the most effective as this treatment reduced 67 % of the wave energy created by a single recreational boat wake, compared to bare sediment. Natural resource managers and landowners facing shoreline erosion issues can use this information to create effective stabilization protocols that preserve shorelines while conserving native intertidal habitats.

AB  - With a growing population (over 40%) living in coastal counties within the U.S., there is an increasing risk that coastal communities will be significantly impacted by riverine/coastal flooding and high winds associated with tropical cyclones. Climate change could exacerbate these risks; thus, it would be prudent for coastal communities to plan for resilience in the face of these uncertainties. In order to address all of these risks, a coupled physics-based modeling system has been developed that simulates total water levels. This system uses parametric models for both rainfall and wind, which only require essential information (e.g., track and central pressure) generated by a hurricane model. The system is validated with Hurricane Isabel hindcasts: One using the parametric system and another using data assimilated fields. The results show a good agreement to the available data, indicating that the system is able to adequately capture the hazards using parametric models, as compared to optimized fields. The validated system was then utilized to simulate randomly generated scenarios that account for future uncertainty, i.e., amount of sea level rise and storm strength/track, as influenced by projected climate change scenarios. Results are then used in next step in the development of a system-wide, community resilience model.

AB  - Widespread global declines in shellfish reefs (ecosystem‐forming bivalves such as oysters and mussels) have led to growing interest in their restoration and protection. With restoration projects now occurring on four continents and in at least seven countries, global restoration guidelines for these ecosystems have been developed based on experience over the past two decades. The following key elements of the guidelines are outlined: (a) the case for shellfish reef restoration and securing financial resources; (b) planning, feasibility, and goal setting; (c) biosecurity and permitting; (d) restoration in practice; (e) scaling up from pilot to larger scale restoration, (f) monitoring, (g) restoration beyond oyster reefs (specifically mussels), and (h) successful communication for shellfish reef restoration projects.

AB  - While coral reefs in Australia have historically been a showcase of conventional management informed by research, recent declines in coral cover have triggered efforts to innovate and integrate intervention and restoration actions into management frameworks. Here we outline the multi-faceted intervention approaches that have developed in Australia since 2017, from newly implemented in-water programs, research to enhance coral resilience and investigations into socio-economic perspectives on restoration goals. We describe in-water projects using coral gardening, substrate stabilisation, coral repositioning, macro-algae removal, and larval-based restoration techniques. Three areas of research focus are also presented to illustrate the breadth of Australian research on coral restoration, (1) the transdisciplinary Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), one of the world's largest research and development programs focused on coral reefs, (2) interventions to enhance coral performance under climate change, and (3) research into socio-cultural perspectives. Together, these projects and the recent research focus reflect an increasing urgency for action to confront the coral reef crisis, develop new and additional tools to manage coral reefs, and the consequent increase in funding opportunities and management appetite for implementation. The rapid progress in trialling and deploying coral restoration in Australia builds on decades of overseas experience, and advances in research and development are showing positive signs that coral restoration can be a valuable tool to improve resilience at local scales (i.e., high early survival rates across a variety of methods and coral species, strong community engagement with local stakeholders). RRAP is focused on creating interventions to help coral reefs at multiple scales, from micro scales (i.e., interventions targeting small areas within a specific reef site) to large scales (i.e., interventions targeting core ecosystem function and social-economic values at multiple select sites across the Great Barrier Reef) to resist, adapt to and recover from the impacts of climate change. None of these interventions aim to single-handedly restore the entirety of the Great Barrier Reef, nor do they negate the importance of urgent climate change mitigation action.

AB  - We surveyed the occurrence of three emergent alien aquatic plants, Gymnocoronis spilanthoides, Alternanthera sessilis, and Alternanthera philoxeroides, in Lake Kasumigaura from 2013 to 2017. To determine the effects of shoreline modification on the expansion of alien aquatic plants, we compared the relative occurrence of alien aquatic plants in varying shoreline conditions modified by shoreline hardening and wave breakers. The distribution of alien aquatic species increased continually in Lake Kasumigaura over the study period, although the rate of expansion differed among years. Furthermore > 64.6% of the vegetative fragments were found within 2 km of the nearest patch. The construction of artificial wave breakers, which were installed parallel to the shoreline, had a positive influence on alien aquatic plant patch establishment. Especially, parallel wave breakers increased the patch establishment of G. spilanthoides by about 2.27-fold compared to the natural environment. Perpendicular wave breakers increased alien patch establishment by about 1.63-fold. For lakeshore management, it is important to consider both alien plant suppression and levee protection. We further suggest prompt action to prevent the expansion of alien aquatic species around pumping stations, which can also result in the relocation and expansion of invasive species.

AB  - We simulate potential costs, market returns, and nonmarket ecosystem benefits for commercial bottom oyster reefs, off-bottom oyster aquaculture, oyster-based living shorelines, and (non-harvested) restored oysters reefs. Results indicate that the range of benefits accruing from commercial bottom reefs and non-harvest restored reefs may be less variable than off-bottom aquaculture and living shorelines. On average, bottom reefs, off-bottom aquaculture, and restored reefs are expected to yield positive net benefits, whereas net benefits of living shorelines are highly variable are more likely to yield negative net benefits, except for under the most optimistic assumptions. Bottom reefs and restored reefs have lower per-unit costs and lower benefits, whereas off-bottom aquaculture has higher per-unit costs, but also higher per-unit revenues; living shorelines have higher upfront construction costs and highly variable nonmarket benefits. Bottom reef and off-bottom aquaculture benefits are driven by market revenues, whereas restored reef and living shoreline benefits are driven by nonmarket ecosystem services.

AB  - We proposed new techniques in statistics and in genetic algorithms. We used biological principles to innovate new approaches in genetic algorithms that yielded improved solutions to optimization problems, finding improved best known results for multiple instances. These mimicked patterns in the natural world, including female choice of mates, as well as alpha male social structures. We also highlight inconsistencies between biological processes and their genetic algorithm counter-parts.

AB  - We present an analysis of Eastern oyster (Crassostreia virginica) production systems dominant in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. We identify likely ranges of costs, returns, and ecosystem benefits associated with three production systems: commercial bottom production, commercial off-bottom aquaculture, and non-harvested reefs. We compile the limited and disparate literature on costs, yields, and returns associated with U.S. commercial oyster production. Benefits associated with commercial bottom production are expected to be less variable than off-bottom aquaculture and non-harvested reefs. Bottom production is expected to yield positive returns, whereas off-bottom aquaculture is equally likely to yield positive or negative returns. Off-bottom aquaculture has higher per-unit costs, but also higher per-unit revenues. Non-harvested reefs are expected to yield negative net benefits. Market benefits dwarf nonmarket benefits. Non-harvested reefs are generally expensive, but may provide benefits that commercial production systems do not, particularly shoreline protection and larvae for nearby harvested reefs.

AB  - We evaluated the importance of both tidal inundation and nutrient fertilization as drivers of elevation change in coastal salt marshes. The three sites investigated occurred along a 9-km stretch of the Atlantic Intracoastal Water Way in Central North Carolina. Despite their close geographic proximity, the sites varied in tidal range, elevation within the tidal frame, and stem height and stem density of Spartina alterniflora. Total standing aboveground biomass and marsh surface elevation change (measured by surface elevation tables; SETs) were documented during a 3-year period of nutrient fertilization and for two additional years after fertilization ceased. Measured elevation change rates in control plots varied from 0.2 to 1.2 cm year−1 and were negatively correlated with starting elevation (r 2 = 0.82, p < 0.05). Fertilization resulted in increases in both standing aboveground biomass and marsh surface elevation change. Fertilized sites gained 0.69 to 2.1 cm year−1 during the 3-year application period and 0.02 to 0.97 cm year−1 during the post application period. The magnitude of the fertilization-induced elevation response was mediated by position in the tidal frame with sites that were lower gaining less elevation relative to controls than sites that were higher. The data presented here suggest that nutrient fertilization may be an effective adaptive management strategy for helping minerogenic marshes keep pace with sea level, but that the impact of fertilization may depend on tidal inundation.

AB  - We evaluated the impact of shoreline dynamics on fringing vegetation density at mid- and low-marsh elevations at a high-energy site in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Particularly, we selected eight unprotected shoreline stretches (75 m each) at a historically eroding site and measured their inter-annual lateral movement rate using the DSAS method for three consecutive years. We observed high inter-annual variability of shoreline movement within the selected stretches. Specifically, shorelines retrograded (eroded) in year 1 and year 3, whereas, in year 2, shorelines advanced seaward. Despite shoreline advancement in year 2, an overall net erosion was recorded during the survey period. Additionally, vegetation density generally declined at both elevations during the survey period; however, probably due to their immediate proximity with lateral erosion agents (e.g., waves, currents), marsh grasses at low-elevation exhibited abrupt reduction in density, more so than grasses at mid elevation. Finally, contrary to our hypothesis, despite shoreline advancement, vegetation density did not increase correspondingly in year 2 probably due to a lag in response from biota. More studies in other coastal systems may advance our knowledge of marsh edge systems; however, we consider our results could be beneficial to resource managers in preparing protection plans for coastal wetlands against chronic stressors such as lateral erosion.

AB  - We analyzed current best practices and recommendations used in the implementation of mangrove rehabilitation and restoration (R/R) projects in the Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) and the Indo-West Pacific biogeographic regions during the last 20 years. Comprehensive literature and World Wide Web searches were performed identifying 90 sites around the world where R/R actions have been implemented. For each site, we analyzed the sources of damage/impact and classified the origin as natural (siltation, erosion, the direct and indirect effect of tropical storms or tsunamis) or anthropogenic (pollution, land use policies, overharvesting, aquaculture, altered hydrology and hydroperiod). In most cases, the causes of damage were a complex mixture associated to erosion, hydrological impairment, deforestation, siltation, and land conversion for aquaculture and other land uses. The area extension of mangrove sites undergoing restoration or just afforestation ranged from few square meters to several thousand hectares. Numerous projects were implemented without an underlying science-based approach and were often ill-prepared and unsuccessful. Although there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to restore or rehabilitate mangrove wetlands, published studies (particularly peer reviewed) provide useful insights into designing R/R projects with clearly defined and prioritized management objectives based on a diagnostic of the source of damage/deterioration. A critical step is to develop a decision tree that serves as a guide to optimize the use of available funding in the development, implementation, and monitoring of R/R protocols to set clear objectives, goals and deadlines. These steps should be part of a robust research agenda based on sound ecological theory and reliable monitoring practices, including the participation of local communities. Any monitoring and reporting program should address spatial and temporal replication that explicitly includes reference sites near the target restoration site. The results of each R/R project, whether successful or not, should be published, as they are critical sources of data and information for further development of mangrove R/R practices and methods within the community of restoration ecology science. We urge the continental level implementation of guidelines to advance international initiatives aimed to protect and conserve one the most productive and threatened coastal ecosystems in the world.

AB  - Wave energy and storm surges threaten coastal ecology and nearshore infrastructures. Although coastal structures are conventionally constructed to dampen the wave energy, they introduce tremendous damage to the ecology of the coast. To minimize environmental impact, ecofriendly coastal protection schemes should be introduced. In this paper, we discuss an example of an innovative mangrove rehabilitation attempt to restore the endangered mangroves on Carey Island, Malaysia. A submerged detached breakwater system was constructed to dampen the energy of wave and trap the sediments behind the structure. Further, a large number of mangrove seedlings were planted using different techniques. Further, we assess the possibility of success for a future mangrove rehabilitation project at the site in the context of sedimentology, bathymetry, and hydrogeochemistry. The assessment showed an increase in the amount of silt and clay, and the seabed was noticeably elevated. The nutrient concentration, the pH value, and the salinity index demonstrate that the site is conducive in establishing mangrove seedlings. As a result, we conclude that the site is now ready for attempts to rehabilitate the lost mangrove forest.

AB  - Virtual Cylinder Model (VCM) was used to simulate flows over vegetation plants (cylinders) in coastal wetlands. VCM is capable of characterizing the flow field with a few plants as well as numerous plants with high efficiency and accuracy. Numerical results of flow over cylinders at a regular pattern are compared with Direct Numerical Simulations and at irregular patterns are presented with varied resolutions. VCM provides decent accuracy and efficiency without high resolution in tiny mesh. Results demonstrate that it is suitable for large-scale simulation of vegetation resilience to protect coastal wetlands from waves.Copyright © 2014 by ASME

AB  - Vietnamese mangroves are among the most productive and biologically important ecosystems of the world; providing habitat/nursing grounds for commercial and non-commercial fish species, food, medicine, building materials/fuel for local communities, as well as carbon storage (blue carbon) and coastal protection from storm events. However, Vietnam's mangroves have been lost in recent decades (∼38%) or degraded, predominantly driven by herbicides during the Vietnam War and later by conversion to aquaculture and coastal development, although there has been a recent slowing of this degradation as a result of restoration and protection schemes. This review article discusses the principal factors which influence mangroves in Vietnam including climate and climate change, hydrology, soil and topography, and anthropogenic factors such as aquaculture expansion, illegal logging, damming, pollution), which requires special attention. We further discuss the important role that Vietnamese mangrove forests play an in the socio-economic development of the country, even though the exploitation and protection of mangrove forests in many provinces are often uncontrolled. We discuss successful management practices including co-management models for mangrove restoration, which have been a success in Vietnam. Conservation and rehabilitation process of mangrove forests by various national and international agencies are still on-going and the success of such activities is influenced by various socio-economic, political as well as environmental factors. Further challenges in effective mangrove management arise due to climate change, which accelerates high atmospheric CO2, increased air temperature, sea level rise, storminess, ocean currents and alterations in precipitation regime. Recent developments in remote sensing applications can be utilized to improve the mapping and monitoring the changes in mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam thereby improving the effective management of mangrove forests.

AB  - Vessel generated waves can impact shoreline stability and habitat structure in many waterways. Sheltered regions, such as coastal plain saltmarshes, support fragile ecosystems and can be particularly vulnerable to the effects of unregulated vessel operations. Instruments for measuring currents and sediment concentration were deployed in a coastal plain saltmarsh to examine the small-scale physical characteristics of the vessel wake generated by recreational craft typical of this environment. The response to vessel wake varied sharply depending upon the stage of the tide. At low tide, waves breaking on the exposed bank produced high concentrations of suspended material that were transported offshore through turbulent diffusion. When the water elevation exceeded the toe of the marsh scarp, the concentration and turbulent kinetic energy exhibited less of a statistically significant variation in response to vessel passage. For the most energetic flows, the vessel orbital velocities were dwarfed by turbulent fluctuations generated by the sheared tidal boundary layer. While further research is required, preliminary findings indicate that the dissipation of vessel wake energy may stimulate or enhance shear generated turbulence if the characteristic wave period is similar to the characteristic time scale of the energy containing eddies.

AB  - Vegetation can contribute to coastal defence by damping incoming waves. However, prior studies have shown that attenuation varies greatly among plant species. Plant flexibility is a mechanical property that is commonly omitted, but varies considerably between shrubs and grasses on salt marshes. Therefore, we present an experimental study in a laboratory wave flume with artificial vegetation that differs in flexibility only. We measured wave attenuation and water particle velocities around rigid and flexible salt marsh vegetation. Waves were measured using a series of gauges and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure spatio-temporal variations of water particle velocities in the x - z plane around the vegetation. Our results show that flexible vegetation attenuates waves up to 70% less than rigid vegetation due to swaying of flexible plants. Furthermore, we find that rigid vegetation modifies the velocity structure, whereas flexible vegetation does not. Specifically, a mean current in the direction of wave propagation develops around the canopy and the horizontal particle velocities are amplified directly above the canopy. These results indicate that plant flexibility is a key parameter in the wave-vegetation interaction that controls wave damping and velocity structure.

AB  - US west coast populations of the native Olympia oyster Ostrea lurida declined precipitously in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and were often replaced by the non-native Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) by the aquaculture industry. Recovery of native oyster ecosystem services derived from their suspension feeding activities (termed “filtration services” (FS)) often serves as a powerful incentive for restoration of populations of O. lurida along the US west coast despite uncertainty about the potential effects of their filtration activities on concentrations of suspended particulate matter. Here, we provide an improved FS model for O. lurida and C. gigas in Yaquina Bay, OR, that is based on both in situ feeding behavior and the complex hydrodynamics of the estuary. The total area and the order of locations chosen for oyster restoration in Yaquina Bay were examined to determine how oyster FS could be maximized with limited resources. These modeling efforts quantified estimates showing (1) native oysters, if restored in Yaquina Bay to historic levels, may contribute nearly an order of magnitude greater FS than previously estimated; (2) C. gigas contributes significantly greater FS than O. lurida, especially during the wet season; (3) FS provided by either species is highly dependent upon seasonal river forcing and salinity; (4) spatial variation in FS arises from the hydrodynamics of the system, uneven oysters distributions, and upstream pre-filtering. We found that spatially explicit models demonstrated the benefits of prioritizing restoration to areas with the greatest FS potential, rather than placing oysters randomly within historic habitats. Directing restoration in this manner used between 75% (dry season) and 60% (wet season) less of the restored area needed to achieve comparable FS with randomly placed oysters.

AB  - Urban and periurban ocean developments impact 1.5% of the global exclusive economic zones, and the demand for ocean space and resources is increasing. As we strive for a more sustainable future, it is imperative that we better design, manage, and conserve urban ocean spaces for both humans and nature. We identify three key objectives for more sustainable urban oceans: reduction of urban pressures, protection and restoration of ocean ecosystems, and support of critical ecosystem services. We describe an array of emerging evidence-based approaches, including greening grayinfrastructure, restoring habitats, and developing biotechnologies. We then explore new economic instruments and incentives for supporting these new approaches and evaluate their feasibility in delivering these objectives. Several of these tools have the potential to help bring nature back to the urban ocean while also addressing some of the critical needs of urban societies, such as climate adaptation, seafood production, clean water, and recreation, providing both human and environmental benefits in some of our most impacted ocean spaces.

AB  - Two distinct microtidal estuarine systems were assessed to advance the understanding of the coastal dynamics of sea level rise in salt marshes. A coupled hydrodynamic-marsh model (Hydro-MEM) was applied to both a marine-dominated (Grand Bay, Mississippi) and a mixed fluvial/marine (Weeks Bay, Alabama) system to compute marsh productivity, marsh migration, and potential tidal inundation from the year 2000 to 2100 under four sea level rise scenarios. Characteristics of the estuaries such as geometry, sediment availability, and topography, were compared to understand their role in the dynamic response to sea level rise. The results show that the low sea level rise scenario (20 cm) approximately doubled high-productivity marsh coverage in the marine-dominated estuary by the year 2100 due to an equilibrium between the rates of sea level rise and marsh platform accretion. Under intermediate-low sea level rise (50 cm), high-productivity marsh coverage in the year 2100 increased (doubled in the marine-dominated estuary and a seven-fold increase in the mixed estuary) by expanding into higher lands followed by the creation of interior ponds. The results also indicate that marine-dominated estuaries are vulnerable to collapse as a result of low, relatively uniform topography and lack of sediment sources, whereas mixed estuaries are able to expand due to higher elevations and sediment inputs. The results from the higher sea level rise scenarios (the intermediate-high (120 cm) and high (200 cm)) showed expansion of the bays along with marsh migration to higher land, producing a five-fold increase in wetland coverage for the mixed estuary and virtually no net change for the marine-dominated estuary. Additionally, hurricane storm surge simulations showed that under higher sea level rise scenarios, the marine-dominated estuary demonstrated weaker peak stage attenuation indicating that the marsh’s ability to dissipate storm surge is sensitive to productivity changes and bay expansion / marsh loss.

AB  - Tropical coastlines will see some of the greatest urbanization rates of the twenty first century, presenting a particular threat to the management of mangrove ecosystems. This is compounded by a significant void in our understanding of how urban mangroves function. Although mangrove responses to urban environments around the world have been recorded for roughly 35 years, there remains no model describing these systems. Collectively, these studies suggest urban mangroves are characterized by patchy and mixed vegetation forests within expanding suburban fringes, but more stable and expanding forests in older city centers. Where municipal sewage is disposed, a significant body of evidence suggests enrichment of anthropogenically derived nitrogen in mangrove plant tissues. Further, benthic faunal communities in these systems are influenced by sewage effluent. Much of this is likely due to changes in nutrient inputs in these systems; however, it is also due to toxicity from heavy metals and hydrocarbons. These contaminants may also be influencing mangrove physiology and growth, although this has yet to be shown in situ. Urban faunal communities of fin-fish and birds also respond to differences in habitat and resource availability of urban mangroves. This chapter reviews the literature on urban mangroves, revealing emergent patterns that are at times confirmed by empirical evidence. These patterns are then synthesized in an urban mangrove model. Through continuing studies and the development of this model, future mangrove management along urbanizing coasts will be much more effective at optimizing ecosystem services and creating more sustainable social-ecological mangrove systems.

AB  - To fulfil international conservation commitments, governments have begun to recognise the need for more proactive marine planning policies, advocating sensitive engineering design that can deliver secondary benefits above and beyond the primary purpose of developments. In response, there is growing scientific interest in novel multi-functional coastal defence structures with built-in secondary ecological and/or socio-economic benefits. To ensure research efforts are invested effectively, it is first necessary to determine what secondary benefits can potentially be built-in to engineered coastal defence structures, and further, which of these benefits would be most desirable. It is unlikely that secondary benefits are perceived in the same way across different stakeholder groups. Further, their order of priority when evaluating different options is unlikely to be consistent, since each option will present a suite of compromises and trade-offs. The aim of this study was to investigate stakeholder attitudes towards multi-functional coastal defence developments across different sector groups. A preliminary questionnaire indicated unanimous support for implementing multi-functional structures in place of traditional single-purpose ones. This preliminary survey informed the design of a Delphi-like study, which revealed a more nuanced and caveated level of support from a panel of experts and practitioners. The study also elicited a degree of consensus that the most desirable secondary benefits that could be built-in to developments would be ecological ones – prioritised over social, economic and technical benefits. This paper synthesises these findings, discusses the perceived barriers that remain, and proposes a stepwise approach to effective implementation of multi-functional coastal defence developments.

AB  - To examine the role of substratum concavity in determining oyster [Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791)] settlement success, laboratory settlement was examined on natural and artificial substrata of various concavities, defined by width-to-depth (W:D) ratio. Experiments were conducted in 204-l capacity laboratory flumes. Concavities tested include W:D ratios of 2, 5, and 16, plus a flat surface for control comparisons. Active settlement, passive settlement, and flow around these concavity treatments were examined. In addition, settlement on oyster shell cultch presented in different surface orientations, and either zip-tied to open mats, or packed in mesh bags, was examined. Results indicate that concavity can affect settlement success (W:D ratio of 5 resulted in the highest settlement success under this study's conditions). Examination of flow rates and patterns suggests that water movement over W:D 5 treatments delivers larvae to the settlement surface, but active attachment behavior is required to explain W:D 5's higher settlement densities relative to W:D 2. The highest settlement occurred with open mats on surfaces oriented horizontally and facing downward. Comparisons of mat, bag, and orientation results suggest that optimal current range for settlement is between 0.3 and 2.0 cm/sec. Too little flow results in supply failure, while flow exceeding 2 cm/sec inhibits searching and attachment behaviors.

AB  - To achieve high accuracy bathymetry retrieval using remote sensing images with robust performance in a 0 to 25 m-deep lagoon with sharp bottom depth variations, a new Iterative Multiple Band Ratio (IMBR) algorithm is tested against known Multiple Band Ratio (MBR) and Single Band Ratio (SBR) algorithms. The test was conducted using the five multispectral bands, at 10 to 60 m resolution, of a Sentinel-2 image of the 25 km2 Poe lagoon, a UNESCO World Heritage Area. The IMBR approach requires training datasets for the definitions of depth threshold at which optimal band ratios vary. IMBR achieved accuracy, quantified with an original block cross-validation procedure across the entire depth range reached a mean absolute error of 46.0 cm. It compares very favorably against MBR (78.3 cm) and the various SBR results (188–254 cm). The method is suitable for generalization to other sites pending a minimal ground-truth dataset crossing all the depth range being available. We stress that different users may need different precisions and can use MBR or SBR algorithms for their applications. For the hydrodynamic modelling applications that are developing in New Caledonia, the IMBR solutions applied to Sentinel imagery are optimal.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are increasingly valued for their role in coastal defense. Nevertheless, in situ observations of storm surge attenuation within wetlands are still scarce. We present water level measurements along a 4 km intertidal channel and on the surrounding marsh platform for regular spring to neap tides and two major storm surge tides, showing the effects of flood wave height and marsh geomorphology on the amount of flood wave attenuation. Undermarsh tides with peak water levels below marsh platform elevation are mostly amplified (up to 4 cm/km) within the channels. Overmarsh tides with peak water levels above the marsh platform are generally attenuated along the channels, with maximum attenuation rates of 5 cm/km for tides that inundate the marsh platform by 0.5–1.0 m. For lower or higher flood waves, including storm surges, attenuation rates decrease. Furthermore, the observations show that the maximum attenuation occurs along narrow channel transects where the width of the platform is larger, whereas attenuation rates are lower along wider channels with smaller adjacent marsh platforms. These observations are confirmed by an analytical approximation of tidal wave propagation through convergent channels. The analytical model indicates that differences in attenuation rates are induced by variations in the cross-channel averaged friction between channel sections and between tides with varying peak water levels. Finally, the highest attenuation rates of up to 70 cm/km are observed over short distances on the vegetated marsh platform. We conclude that this study provides an empirical basis for the wider implementation of nature-based flood defense strategies.

AB  - Tidal marshes (including saltmarshes) provide remarkable value for many social (cultural, recreational) and environmental (fish production, water quality, shoreline protection, carbon sequestration) services. However, their extent, condition, and capacity to support these services are threatened by human development expansion, invasive species, erosion, altered hydrology and connectivity, and climate change. The past two decades have seen a shift toward working with managers to restore tidal marshes to conserve existing patches or create new marshes. The present perspective examines key features of recent tidal marsh restoration projects. Although optimism about restoration is building, not all marshes are the same; site-specific nuances require careful consideration, and thus, standard restoration designs are not possible. Restoration projects are effectively experiments, requiring clear goals, monitoring and evaluation, and adaptive management practices. Restoration is expensive; however, payment schemes for ecosystem services derived from restoration offer new ways to fund projects and appropriate monitoring and evaluation programs. All information generated by restoration needs to be published and easily accessible, especially failed attempts, to equip practitioners and scientists with actionable knowledge for future efforts. We advocate the need for a network of tidal marsh scientists, managers, and practitioners to share and disseminate new observations and knowledge. Such a network will help augment our capacity to restore tidal marsh, but also valuable coastal ecosystems more broadly.

AB  - Throughout history, humans living in the coastal area constantly adapt to the natural environment and create a changing environment. The rapid coastal development occurred in the mid-19th century and peaks in the mid-20th century, which was a common process in most industrialized areas. With increasing population growth and urban sprawl, many coastal lowlands are unprecedently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea level rise, increasing extreme storm events, and coastal flooding. Under the influence of urban revitalization and conservation, the landward shoreline movement accelerated and coastal land shrank, accompanied by community retreat. This research focuses on the importance of incorporating an understanding of the changing coastal land-ocean interaction into adaptive management strategies by illustrating the relationship of land use change, social-economic development, and climate change. Typical coastal changes in Connecticut were selected: New Haven Harbor reflects a dramatic seaward land accretion under industrial and transportation development, New London downtown waterfront reveals a trend of building retreat under industrial and commercial transformation and coastal hazard, New London Ocean Beach indicates how overdeveloped coastal low-lying community fully retreat after a natural disaster, and Jordan Cove barrier island shows a highly dynamic coastal land change and proactive management strategy. The results reveal that to cope with a constantly changing shoreline and the challenges of climate change, a resilient management process must incorporate a cycle of learning, experimenting, and creating with the goal of developing new solutions that are able to deal with our ever-changing environment.

AB  - This work proposes a green material for artificial reefs to be placed in Galicia (northwest Spain) taking into account the principles of circular economy and sustainability of the ecosystem. New concrete formulations for marine applications, based on cement and/or sand replacement by mussel shells, are analyzed in terms of resistance to abrasion. The interest lies in the importance of the canning industry of Galicia, which generates important quantities of shell residues with negative environmental consequences. Currently, the tests to determine the abrasion erosion resistance of concrete on hydraulic structures involve large and complex devices. According to this, an experimental test has been proposed to estimate and compare the wear resistance of these concretes and, consequently, to analyze the environmental performance of these structures. First, a numerical analysis validated with experimental data was conducted to design the test. Subsequently, experimental tests were performed using a slurry tank in which samples with conventional cement and sand were partially replaced by mussel shell. The abrasive erosion effect of concrete components was analyzed by monitoring the mass loss. It shows an asymptotic trend with respect to time that has been modeled by Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and nonlinear regression models. The results were compared to concrete containing only conventional cement and sand. Replacing sand and/or cement by different proportions of mussel shells has not significantly reduced the resistance of concrete against erosive degradation, except for the case where a high amount of sand (20 wt.%) is replaced. Its resistance against the erosive abrasion is increased, losing between 0.1072 and 0.0310 wt.% lower than common concrete. In all the remaining cases (replacements of the 5–10 wt.% of sand and cement), the effect of mussel replacement on erosive degradation is not significant. These results encourage the use of mussel shells in the composition of concrete, taking into account that we obtain the same degradation properties, even more so considering an important residue in the canning industry (and part of the seabed) that can be valorized.

AB  - This study was conducted to compare the sediment parameters of 2 project sites located near Dauphin Island, AL, which each contained a natural shoreline (NS), a living shoreline (LS), and a hardened shoreline (HS) treatment. We collected sediment core samples from the shallow intertidal zone along 3 replicate transects and sectioned them into shallow (0–15 cm) and deep (16–30 cm) fractions. We analyzed sediment subsamples for bulk density, sediment grain size, total carbon, total nitrogen, and extractable phosphorus. At both project sites, HS sediments contained significantly more sand (>90% percent) and higher bulk density than NS and LS sediments. The HS sediments also contained significantly less C and N than the LS and NS. These data suggest that LS treatments over time facilitate conditions that favor organic-matter rich and fine-grained sediments and approach the conditions found in the NS, in contrast to HS sediments that become less suitable for marsh development. These sediment changes in LS treatmnts promote habitat conditions that help facilitate marsh expansion and thereby provide important habitat for estuarine dependent wildlife.

AB  - This study presents the most comprehensive set of ecosystem service provision estimates for diverse oyster-based resources to date. We use expert elicitation methods to derive estimates of five ecosystem services provided by oysters: oyster harvest (as indicated by oyster density), improved water quality (net nitrogen assimilation), shoreline protection (net erosion), and other fish habitat (blue crab and red drum density). Distributions are estimated for three distinct resources: on-bottom production, off-bottom farms, and non-harvested restoration/conservation efforts, under twelve distinct scenarios according to varying environmental conditions (eutrophication, sedimentation, and salinity regimes). Our expert-derived estimates of ecosystem services provide useful comparisons across oyster resources of both expected ecosystem service delivery levels and the amount of variation in those levels. These estimates bridge an information gap regarding relative performance of diverse oyster resources along multiple dimensions and should serve as a useful guide for resource managers facing competing interests.

AB  - This study on carcinological aspects of oyster farming was carried out at the coast of Yunlin County, Taiwan, for a period of 25 months from July 2012 to July 2014. The space formed by the clustering of the oyster shells provides a habitat for at least eight species of crabs. Nanosesarma minutum was the dominant species (73.7% or n=18753) with an average of 59.5 ± 30.6 individuals/string/month, while the average monthly rate of ovigerous females was 12.6 ± 13.0%, and the average number of eggs per berried female was 1510.8 ± 1018.7 eggs/individual. Hemigrapsus penicillatus was the second dominant species (23.9% or n=6074) with an average of 17.4 ± 17.1 individuals/string/month; here, the average monthly rate of ovigerous female crabs was 4.6 ± 9.0, and the average number of eggs of a berried female was 3073.4 ± 2167.5 eggs/individual.

AB  - This study examines the morphodynamic response of a deltaic system to extreme weather events. The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in Louisiana, USA, is used to illustrate the impact of extreme events (hurricanes) on a river-dominated deltaic system. Simulations using the open source Delft3D model reveal that Hurricane Rita, which made landfall 120 km to the west of WLD as a Category 3 storm in 2005, caused erosion on the right side and deposition on the left side of the hurricane eye track on the continental shelf line (water depth 10 m to 50 m). Erosion over a wide area occurred both on the continental shelf line and in coastal areas when the hurricane moved onshore, while deposition occurred along the Gulf coastline (water depth < 5 m) when storm surge water moved back offshore. The numerical model estimated that Hurricane Rita’s storm surge reached 2.5 m, with maximum currents of 2.0 m s–1, and wave heights of 1.4 m on the WLD. The northwestern-directed flow and waves induced shear stresses, caused erosion on the eastern banks of the deltaic islands and deposition in channels located west of these islands. In total, Hurricane Rita eroded more than 500,000 m3 of sediments on the WLD area. Including waves in the analysis resulted in doubling the amount of erosion in the study area, comparing to the wave-excluding scenario. The exclusion of fluvial input caused minor changes in deltaic morphology during the event. Vegetation cover was represented as rigid rods in the model which add extra source terms for drag and turbulence to influence the momentum and turbulence equations. Vegetation slowed down the floodwater propagation and decreased flow velocity on the islands, leading to a 47% reduction in the total amount of erosion. Morphodynamic impact of the hurricane track relative to the delta was explored. Simulations indicate that the original track of Hurricane Rita (landfall 120 km west of the WLD) produced twice as much erosion and deposition at the delta compared to a hurricane of a similar intensity that made landfall directly on the delta. This demonstrates that the wetlands located on the right side of a hurricane track experience more significant morphological changes than areas located directly on the hurricane track.

AB  - This study evaluated the status of coral communities at the fringing reefs in the northern South China Sea, and their potential role in maintaining nearby coastline stability of northeastern Hainan Island (Puqian Bay, Hainan Bay). Thirty-nine coral species were recorded with mean coral cover of 5.3%, and are dominated by massive Galaxea, Platygyra and Porites. The coral communities were clustered into two groups (Clu-HNB and Clu-PQB) corresponding to different stable coastal conditions. Coral communities at the Hainan Bay with higher diversity and greater cover corresponded to relatively stable coastline, whereas those at the southern Puqian Bay (with the lowest coral diversity and spatial coverage) corresponded to severe coastline erosion. This work provides some direct evidence that declined coral reefs would weaken their functions to maintain a stable coastline, resulting in severe coastal erosion. It is also useful to help coastal managers and local people pay more attention to the importance of coral reefs in coastal protection and encourage them to change their ways to get sustainable use of coral reef resources. It may be beneficial to inspire or initiate coastal engineering to manage coasts with natural coral reef solution.

AB  - This study assessed the diet of Summer flounder (SF, Paralichthys dentatus) in Shinnecock Bay, NY. Summer flounder are a recreationally and commercially important marine flatfish species found along the Eastern U.S. coastline. Despite their importance, few studies have examined the trophodynamics of a broad size spectrum of this species. Diet composition of summer flounder (n= 88) was assessed from 2014 to 2016 throughout Shinnecock Bay, a eutrophic bar-built estuary in New York. Species consumed and diet species richness differed significantly amongst SF size classes, with large (≥375 mm total length) and medium (>225:<375 mm) summer flounder showing higher levels of piscivory and more diverse diets than small-sized (≤225 mm) conspecifics. As voracious plastic predators, trends in annual and monthly diet variation generally followed prey availability in Shinnecock Bay. One exception to this general pattern occurred for winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). Despite their low relative abundance in the bay, winter flounder was highly preferred as prey by summer flounder; (Chesson index, α= 0.35) and was their predominant prey item accounting for 12.3 % (s.d.±3.9%) of the diet by weight. Other factors that explained the variability of the diet of summer flounder were year, month, dissolved oxygen concentration, bay region and habitat, with a cumulative variance of 10.3 %. Interestingly, clear differences in the diet (i.e. species richness and abundance) of summer flounder were found within regions of Shinnecock Bay, with a decrease in teleost biomass and species richness observed in the western region where water quality is more degraded and less seagrass is available compared to the more pristine eastern region. Distinct trophic dynamics in degraded habitats suggests fundamentally different food webs that could have important consequences to ecosystem stability and resilience. As coastal areas continue to experience degradation, diet studies of economically and ecologically important species can aid in the development of effective ecosystem-based management plans.

AB  - This study analyzed the shoreline change processes along the Phetchaburi intertidal mudflats with mangroves located on the western portion of the Upper Gulf of Thailand during the period 1953–2017. Historical shoreline positions along the coast were derived from the aerial photographs taken in 1953, 1967, 1976, 1994, 2002 and the satellite imagery in 2006, 2009, 2014, and 2017 using the Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) software. All imagery data were geo-referenced into Universal Transverse Mercator projection with the World Geodetic System 1983 (WGS1983) to eliminate distortion from the aerial photographs and satellite imagery. The shoreline positions along the study area were then digitized for each time period. The outer boundary of the mangrove forest was mainly used as a proxy to define shoreline positions of the muddy beach. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.4 was used to analyze the changes of shoreline positions in the study area. Results from this study revealed that about 26% of the 30 km Phetchaburi muddy shoreline in the mid portion of the study area had continuously retreated over the past sixty years with an average rate of −6.5 ± 1.8 m/y. The remaining, which was mainly located in the uppermost portion (near the major river mouths) and the lowermost portion (near a natural sandspit) had advanced seaward with the maximum and average rates of 30.0 ± 1.8 and 8.6 ± 1.8 m/y, respectively. Unlike mangrove muddy coasts in other regions, the results of this study suggested that the conversion of mangrove forest to agriculture and shrimp farming had not affected the rate of shoreline accretion of the study area. The variation of shoreline advanced rates likely reflected the changes in river sediment supply from the Phetchaburi River basin and in coastal sediment transport processes of the Phetchaburi coastal system. Meanwhile, the local wave and current conditions and the adjacent shoreline stabilization appeared to be the major factors dominating the shoreline recession of the Phetchaburi coast during the past six decades.

AB  - This study aims at evaluating the geographical influences of rice-based protection dykes on floodwater regimes along the main rivers, namely the Mekong and the Bassac, in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Specifically, numerous low dykes and high dykes have been constructed particularly in the upper delta’s floodplains to protect the double and triple rice cropping against the annual flooding. For the whole deltaic domain, a 1D-quasi-2D hydrodynamic model setup was used to simulate seventy-two (72) scenarios of dyke construction development in the context of low, medium, and high floods that occurred in the VMD to examine the effects of different flood magnitudes on a certain dyke construction area. Based on the model simulation results, we established an evaluation indicator, the so-called Geographical Impact Factor (GIF), to evaluate the impacts of zone-based dyke compartments on the floodwater regimes along the main rivers for different kinds of floods. Our findings revealed different rates of influences on the floodwater levels along the Mekong and Bassac Rivers under different scenarios of zone-based high-dyke developments. GIF is a useful index for scientists and decision-makers in land use planning, especially in rice intensification, in conjunction with flood management for the VMD and for similar deltas worldwide.

AB  - This research aims to explore the potentials of nature-based solutions (NbS) to mitigate the socio-economic pressures rising from tourism development within protected natural areas. Paper delivers a tourism studies perspective exclusively, by reviewing publications published between 2008 and 2018 in leading tourism and hospitality journals. The content analysis results support conclusions that each of the tourism development dimensions, i.e. governance, management and conservation, capacity building, visitor management and monitoring, sustainable financing and green infrastructure, can be related to at least one of the NbS approaches via conceptual or implemented measures. Moreover, tourism development in protected areas supports the new perspective of NbS, encompassing intangible governmental interventions. Additionally, the term nature-based solutions has not been established in tourism literature yet. The literature review provides an in-depth understanding of the role of NbS in sustainable tourism development within protected natural areas and suggests a future research agenda for scholars and practitioners. The major limitation of this study is a restriction on journal selection.

AB  - This paper presents the first attempt to capture a comprehensive spatial view of land use change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) for a long period, i.e., from 2000 to 2020. It is aimed at monitoring holistically the land use change and flooding situation in the region, addressing the reasons for land use change, and assessing the impacts of land use change on hydraulic aspects and farmer livelihoods during the last 21 years. MODIS products, in particular, are used to study the dynamics of land use and floods after demonstrating high validation with statistical data and radar satellites, with R(2) = 0.96 and R(2) >/= 0.97 for land use and flood maps, respectively. The results show that rice cultivation is the most dominant land use type, accounting for 40% to 46% of the delta area, while aquaculture accounts for 10% to 22%, respectively. The total rice cultivation area increased from 3764 thousand hectares (thous. ha) in 2001 to 4343 thous. ha in 2015 based on the intensive development of triple rice cropping in the upper zone, then decreased to 3963 thous. ha in 2020. In contrast, aquaculture areas are farmed mainly in the coastal area and remained relatively steady, increasing slightly from 619 thous. ha in 2001 to 856 thous. ha in 2020. The massive construction of dikes for triple rice cropping in the upper zone appears to cause a significant impact on the annual flooding regime. Land use policies have influenced the changes in land use patterns, flooding situations, and the livelihoods of local farmers.

AB  - This paper presents the application of detached breakwater to reduce wave energy for protecting mangrove planting site. Initial planting of mangroves still needs seawater for their growth, but they will be distracted by the big wave. How is the detached breakwater should be designed for this purpose is the objective of this research. This research simulated the wave propagation at the existing condition and under some alternative designs of detached breakwater to find out the optimum design of detached breakwater for mangrove planting site. The CADMAS-SURF is a numerical model that was used for the simulation. Bengkalis coast in Indonesia was picked up as study area of this research. The mangrove degradation and the severe coastal abrasion have occurred in this area for long period. The simulation result shows that in the high tide condition, the wave height and wave velocity at the mangrove plantation area are about 1.12 m and 3.86 m/s respectively in the case of the existing condition. In this case, the initial mangrove plantation cannot be applied because it will be destroyed by the wave. By applying breakwater both for rubble mound type and vertical wall type, the wave height and the wave velocity were reduced to 0.69 m, 2.39 m/s and 0.72 m, 2.31 m/s respectively. In this case, the initial mangrove plantation can be applied because it will not be destroyed by the wave.

AB  - This paper presents a novel coupled flow-vegetation interaction model capable to resolve the flow and motion of flexible vegetation with large deflections simultaneously on a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian grid. The hydrodynamics model is based on a Navier–Stokes flow solver with the Volume of Fluid surface capturing method in OpenFOAM. The deforming and moving vegetation are tracked through a series of Lagrangian grids attached to the vegetation and embedded in the computational domain of OpenFOAM. The governing equations for the flexible vegetation motion are based on a slender rod theory and are solved by a Finite Element Method on a vegetation-following Lagrangian grid. The hydrodynamics and vegetation models are coupled through the vegetation-induced hydrodynamic forces using a novel diffused immersed boundary method to avoid excessive fluid grid refinements around the vegetation. The standard two-equation k − e turbulence model is extended for vegetated flow by incorporating additional closure terms of vegetation effects. The newly developed coupled flow-vegetation model is validated against experiments for both individual single-stem vegetation and a vegetation patch in a large-scale wave flume. Model results of asymmetric displacement of the vegetation motion, wave height decay, and wave kinematics within and outside the vegetation patch are in good agreement with measurements. The drastical change in wave radiation stress by the presence of vegetation patch leads to a strong current jet near the top of vegetation patch, which in turn drives a local circulation pattern around the vegetation patch. The effect of vegetation bending stiffness on the model results and empirical drag and inertia coefficients for calculating the hydrodynamic forces are examined in detail. Maximum turbulence energy is observed close to the bed and the top of vegetation patch just before and after the wave crest/trough, where the relative flow velocity to vegetation is large.

AB  - This paper examines the recreational use values associated with a coastal walking trail under threat from increased episodes of storm surges and coastal erosion, and the cost of alternative grey and nature based infrastructure options that could protect it. These options involve restoring an oyster reef bar that would act as a natural breakwater versus an impermeable revetment. The results of an on-site survey of users of the amenity and a negative binomial travel cost model demonstrate that the coastal trail has considerable recreational use value to local communities. In terms of a cost benefit analysis it was found that both protection options resulted in a positive net benefit over a 20 year time horizon but the nature based solution had a benefit cost ratio multiple times larger than the grey infrastructure alternative. The conclusions of the analysis remain valid under sensitivity analysis. The results suggest a compelling case for embedding nature based solutions in climate adaption and flood management planning for low lying coastal areas where recreational resources are under threat as it can be not only more cost effective but may also offer other ecosystem benefits to coastal communities.

AB  - This paper develops the virtual cylinder model (VCM) to simulate flows through vegetation canopies at low to medium high Reynolds numbers in wetlands. Using a combined Eulerian and Lagrangian approach, the VCM is capable of simulating the flow field around each vegetation stem (modeled as a cylinder) as well as a bulk of numerous stems in a fluid. Numerical results of flows through regularly and randomly arranged cylinders have been compared with direct numerical simulations. Good agreement has been achieved. This model maintains an excellent balance between accuracy and efficiency in modeling interactions between the fluid and vegetation stems. Simulation results demonstrate that this model is promising for investigating the hydrodynamics and vegetation resilience in wetlands that serve as a first line of defense against the sea level rise, storm impacts and coastal erosion.

AB  - This paper describes a semi-quantitative approach for the assessment of sea-level rise (SLR) impacts on social–ecological systems (SES), using Yellow Water wetland on Kakadu National Park as a case study. The approach includes the application of a diagnostic framework to portray the existing SES configuration, including governance structures, in combination with qualitative modelling and Bayesian belief networks. Although SLR is predicted to cause saltwater inundation of freshwater ecosystems, cultural sites and built infrastructure, our study suggested that it may provide also an opportunity to bring together Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge and governance systems, towards a commonly perceived threat. Where feasible, mitigation actions such as levees may be required to manage local SLR impacts to protect important freshwater values. In contrast, adaptation will require strategies that facilitate participation by Kakadu Bininj (the Aboriginal people of Kakadu National Park) in research and monitoring programs that enhance understanding of salinity impacts and the adaptive capacity to respond to reasonably rapid, profound and irreversible future landscape-scale changes.

AB  - This manuscript reviews the progresses made in the understanding of the dynamic interactions between coastal storms and salt marshes, including the dissipation of extreme water levels and wind waves across marsh surfaces, the geomorphic impact of storms on salt marshes, the preservation of hurricanes signals and deposits into the sedimentary records, and the importance of storms for the long term survival of salt marshes to sea level rise. A review of weaknesses, and strengths of coastal defences incorporating the use of salt marshes including natural, and hybrid infrastructures in comparison to standard built solutions is then presented. Salt marshes are effective in dissipating wave energy, and storm surges, especially when the marsh is highly elevated, and continuous. This buffering action reduces for storms lasting more than one day. Storm surge attenuation rates range from 1.7 to 25 cm/km depending on marsh and storms characteristics. In terms of vegetation properties, the more flexible stems tend to flatten during powerful storms, and to dissipate less energy but they are also more resilient to structural damage, and their flattening helps to protect the marsh surface from erosion, while stiff plants tend to break, and could increase the turbulence level and the scour. From a morphological point of view, salt marshes are generally able to withstand violent storms without collapsing, and violent storms are responsible for only a small portion of the long term marsh erosion. Our considerations highlight the necessity to focus on the indirect long term impact that large storms exerts on the whole marsh complex rather than on sole after-storm periods. The morphological consequences of storms, even if not dramatic, might in fact influence the response of the system to normal weather conditions during following inter-storm periods. For instance, storms can cause tidal flats deepening which in turn promotes wave energy propagation, and exerts a long term detrimental effect for marsh boundaries even during calm weather. On the other hand, when a violent storm causes substantial erosion but sediments are redistributed across nearby areas, the long term impact might not be as severe as if sediments were permanently lost from the system, and the salt marsh could easily recover to the initial state.

AB  - This collection of papers provides insights into methods and data currently available to quantify the benefits associated with estuarine habitat restoration projects in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA, with potential applicability to other coastal systems. Extensive habitat restoration is expected to occur in the northern Gulf of Mexico region over the next several decades through funding associated with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Papers in this section examine the development of vegetation, soil properties, invertebrate fauna, and nekton communities in restored coastal marshes and provide a conceptual framework for applying these findings to quantify the benefits associated with compensatory marsh restoration. Extensive meta-analysis of existing data for Gulf of Mexico coastal habitats further confirms that structured habitats such as marsh, submerged aquatic vegetation, and oyster reefs support greater nekton densities than nonvegetated bottom habitat, with oyster reefs supporting different species assemblages than marsh and submerged aquatic vegetation. Other papers demonstrate that while vegetation cover can establish rapidly within the first 5 years of restoration, belowground parameters such as root biomass and soil organic matter remain 44% to 92% lower at restored marshes than reference marshes 15 years after restoration. On average, amphipod and nekton densities are also not fully restored until at least 20 and 13 years following restoration, respectively. Additional papers present methods to estimate the benefits associated with marsh restoration projects, nekton productivity associated with coastal and estuarine habitats, and the benefits associated with the removal of derelict crab traps in Gulf of Mexico estuaries.

AB  - This analysis uses data from a survey of shoreline property owners combined with data on shoreline modification permits to examine whether and how property owners modify their estuarine shorelines. We find that shoreline armoring is very popular among property owners that choose to modify their shoreline. While living shorelines are less common, applications for them are increasing both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of all shoreline modification requests. A number of different issues factor into the shoreline modification decision including effectiveness, cost, aesthetics, and property values. More valuable parcels are more likely to be modified, as are parcels that have been owned longer. Parcels with a high percentage of natural cover or agricultural use are less likely to be modified. Parcels with primary structures that are closer to the shoreline are more likely to have some sort of armoring. Regardless of their choice of shoreline modification, almost all survey respondents believe that their choices have had a neutral or positive impact on erosion and the health of the Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - There remains much debate regarding the perceived tradeoffs of using freshwater and sediment diversions for coastal restoration in terms of balancing the need for wetland restoration versus preserving eastern oyster ( Crassostrea virginica ) production. Further complicating the issue, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence are also expected to affect estuarine water quality. In this study, we developed a process-based numerical modeling system that couples hydrodynamic, water quality, and oyster population dynamics. We selected Breton Sound Estuary (BSE) (∼2740 km 2 ) in the eastern Mississippi River Deltaic Plain since it is home to several of the largest public oyster seed grounds and private leases for the Gulf coast. The coupled oyster population model was calibrated and validated against field observed oyster growth data. We predicted the responses of oyster population in BSE to small- (142 m 3  s −1 ) and large-scale (7080 m 3  s −1 ) river diversions at the Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion structure planned in the 2012 Coastal Master Plan (Louisiana) under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative sea-level rise (RSLR = eustatic SLR + subsidence) compared to a baseline condition (Year 2009). Model results showed that the large-scale diversion had a stronger negative impact on oyster population dynamics via freshening of the entire estuary, resulting in reduced oyster growth rate and production than RSLR. Under the large-scale diversion, areas with optimal oyster growth rates (>15 mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) oyster −1  wk −1 ) and production (>500 g AFDW m −2  yr −1 ) would shift seaward to the southeastern edge of the estuary, turning the estuary into a very low oyster production system. RSLR however played a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of oyster growth rate and production. RSLR would result in an overall estuary-wide decrease in oyster growth rate and production as a consequence of decreased salinities in the middle and lower estuary because rising sea level likely causes increased stage and overbank flow downstream along the lower Mississippi River.

AB  - There is substantial evidence that natural infrastructure (i.e., healthy ecosystems) and combinations of natural and built infrastructure (“hybrid” approaches) enhance coastal resilience by providing important storm and coastal flooding protection, while also providing other benefits. There is growing interest in the U.S., as well as around the world, to use natural infrastructure to help coastal communities become more resilient to extreme events and reduce the risk of coastal flooding. Here we highlight strengths and weaknesses of the coastal protection benefits provided by built infrastructure, natural ecosystems, and the innovative opportunities to combine the two into hybrid approaches for coastal protection. We also examine some case studies where hybrid approaches are being implemented to improve coastal resilience as well as some of the policy challenges that can make implementation of these approaches more difficult. The case studies we examine are largely in the U.S. but also include a couple of international examples as well. Based on this analysis, we conclude that coastal communities and other decision makers need better information in order to incorporate ecosystem protection and restoration into coastal resilience planning efforts. As additional projects are developed, it is important to capitalize on every opportunity to learn more about the cost of natural and hybrid infrastructure projects, the value of the storm and erosion protection benefits provided, and the full suite of co-benefits provided by healthy coastal ecosystems. We highlight top priorities for research, investment in, and application of natural and hybrid approaches. These data are critical to facilitate adoption of these approaches in planning and decision-making at all levels to enhance the resilience of our coasts.

AB  - There is growing recognition that using the properties of nature through nature-based solutions (NBS) can help to provide viable and cost-effective solutions to a wide range of societal challenges, including disaster risk reduction (DRR). However, NBS realization depends critically on the governance framework that enables the NBS policy process. Drawing from three case studies in Nocera Inferiore (Italy), Munich (Germany), and Wolong (China), we identify key governance enablers—the contextual preconditions, policy processes, and institutions—that proved essential for NBS initiation, planning, design, and implementation. In the three cases, interviews confirm the success of the NBS measures and their benefits in terms not only of DRR but of multiple ecological and social–economic co-benefits. Results highlight critical governance enablers of NBS, including: polycentric governance (novel arrangements in the public administration that involved multiple institutional scales and/or sectors); co-design (innovative stakeholder participatory processes that influenced the final NBS); pro-NBS interest and coalition groups (organized pressure groups that advocated for an NBS); and financial incentives (financing community-based implementation and monitoring of NBS). Findings show that the transition to NBS can contribute to multiple global agendas, including DRR, climate change adaptation, and sustainable development.

AB  - There is growing interest to restore oyster populations and develop oyster reefs for their role in ecosystem health and delivery of ecosystem services. Successful and sustainable oyster restoration efforts largely depend on the availability and selection of suitable sites that can support long-term growth and survival of oysters. Hence, in the present study a habitat suitability index (HSI) model was developed for the intertidal rock oyster (Saccostrea cucullata), with special attention: (1) to the role of the monsoon in the suitability of oyster habitats, and (2) to identify potential suitable sites along the south-eastern Bangladesh coast. Seven habitat factors were used as input variables for the HSI model: (1) water temperature; (2) salinity; (3) dissolved oxygen; (4) particulate inorganic matter (PIM); (5) pH; (6) Chlorophyll-a; and (7) water flow velocity. Seven field surveys were conducted at 80 locations to collect geo-spatial environmental data, which were then used to determine HSI scores using habitat suitability functions. The model results showed that the areas suitable (HSI >0.50) for oyster settlement and growth were characterized by relatively high salinities, Chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and pH values. In contrast, freshwater dominated estuaries and nearby coastal areas with high suspended sediment were found less suitable (HSI <0.50) for oysters. HSI model results were validated with observed oyster distribution data. There was strong correlation between the HSI calculated by the model and observed oyster densities (r = 0.87; n = 53), shell height (r = 0.95; n = 53) and their condition index (r = 0.98; n = 53). The good correspondence with field data enhances the applicability of the HSI model as a quantitative tool for evaluating the quality of a site for oyster restoration and culture.

AB  - There is great interest in the restoration and conservation of coastal habitats for protection from flooding and erosion. This is evidenced by the growing number of analyses and reviews of the effectiveness of habitats as natural defences and increasing funding world-wide for nature-based defences-i.e. restoration projects aimed at coastal protection; yet, there is no synthetic information on what kinds of projects are effective and cost effective for this purpose. This paper addresses two issues critical for designing restoration projects for coastal protection: (i) a synthesis of the costs and benefits of projects designed for coastal protection (nature-based defences) and (ii) analyses of the effectiveness of coastal habitats (natural defences) in reducing wave heights and the biophysical parameters that influence this effectiveness. We (i) analyse data from sixty-nine field measurements in coastal habitats globally and examine measures of effectiveness of mangroves, salt-marshes, coral reefs and seagrass/kelp beds for wave height reduction; (ii) synthesise the costs and coastal protection benefits of fifty-two nature-based defence projects and; (iii) estimate the benefits of each restoration project by combining information on restoration costs with data from nearby field measurements. The analyses of field measurements show that coastal habitats have significant potential for reducing wave heights that varies by habitat and site. In general, coral reefs and salt-marshes have the highest overall potential. Habitat effectiveness is influenced by: a) the ratios of wave height-to-water depth and habitat width-to-wavelength in coral reefs; and b) the ratio of vegetation height-to-water depth in salt-marshes. The comparison of costs of nature-based defence projects and engineering structures show that salt-marshes and mangroves can be two to five times cheaper than a submerged breakwater for wave heights up to half a metre and, within their limits, become more cost effective at greater depths. Nature-based defence projects also report benefits ranging from reductions in storm damage to reductions in coastal structure costs.

AB  - There have been few reviews of the effectiveness of the management of coastal mangrove protected areas and coastal land use planning at all levels in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Ben Tre province provides a good case study to enable the assessment of typical management practices in the provinces of the Delta. The study aims to critically review the current strategies for managing the Ben Tre coast and to consider what changes are required to ensure effective coastal management. The current coastal management strategies only dealt with symptoms and worked temporarily. There has been insufficient coordination in land use planning and coastal management among the Ben Tre government agencies, substantially contributing to mangrove loss and degradation. Natural regeneration of local mangrove species and secondary succession, although having been practically effective for protecting from coastal erosion, have not been used as coastal management measures. Three strategies, hold the existing defence line, managed realignment, and no active intervention, are recommended to assist in managing the Ben Tre coast for adaptation to climate change and sea level rise, and livelihood improvement.

AB  - The value of mangroves has been widely acknowledged, but mangrove forests continue to decline due to numerous anthropogenic stressors. The impact of plastic waste is however poorly known, even though the amount of plastic litter is the largest in the region where mangroves are declining the fastest: South East Asia. In this study, we examine the extent of the plastic waste problem in mangroves along the north coast of Java, Indonesia. First, we investigate how much of the forest floor is covered by plastic in the field (in number of items per m2 and in percentage of the forest floor covered by plastic), and if plastic is also buried in the upper layers of the sediment. We then experimentally investigate the effects of a range of plastic cover percentages (0%, 50% and 100%) on root growth, stress response of the tree and tree survival over a period of six weeks. Field monitoring showed that plastic was abundant, with 27 plastic items per m2 on average, covering up to 50% of the forest floor at multiple locations. Moreover, core data revealed that plastic was frequently buried in the upper layers of the sediment where it becomes immobile and can create prolonged anoxic conditions. Our experiment subsequently revealed that prolonged suffocation by plastic caused immediate pneumatophore growth and potential leaf loss. However, trees in the 50%-plastic cover treatment proved surprisingly resilient and were able to maintain their canopy over the course of the experiment, whereas trees in the 100%-plastic cover treatment had a significantly decreased leaf area index and survival by the end of the experiment. Our findings demonstrate that mangrove trees are relatively resilient to partial burial by plastic waste. However, mangrove stands are likely to deteriorate eventually if plastic continues to accumulate.

AB  - The use of natural habitats for coastal protection (also known as Nature-Based Solutions or NBS) in place of engineered structures like breakwaters and seawalls can yield a wide range of ecological and economic benefits. Despite these advantages, NBS are not commonly implemented for shoreline protection due to uncertainty over the amount of protection afforded by each unique feature and how protective capacity and ecological benefits are likely to change over time as NBS mature and adapt to changing environmental drivers. Here, we highlight the recent restoration of Swan Island in the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA, and the collaborative approach used to evaluate post-construction performance, as a framework for quantitative evaluation of NBS projects. At Swan Island, 60 000 cubic yards of dredged sediment were used to elevate and restore the island's footprint with an emphasis on increasing its protective and ecological benefits and long-term resilience to sea-level rise. Five entities have leveraged resources to quantify the benefits and efficacy of island restoration by conducting pre- and post-restoration monitoring, which supports the development of an integrated, simulation model that includes three \"measured\" system parameters: wave height, vegetative biomass, and island profile (i.e., elevations). The model will be used to predict island performance under a range of different system scenarios and used to inform adaptive management options. Results will demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging natural and engineered processes to restore island systems while providing a framework for quantifying NBS.

AB  - The United Nations General Assembly calls for ecosystem restoration to be a primary intervention strategy used to counter the continued loss of natural habitats worldwide, while supporting human health and wellbeing globally. Restoration of coastal marine ecosystems is perceived by many to be expensive and prone to failure, in part explaining its low rates of implementation compared with terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, marine ecosystem restoration is a relatively new field, and we argue that assessments of its potential to answer this call should not rely on typical outcomes, but also to learn from successful outliers. Here, we review successful restoration efforts across a suite of metrics in coastal marine systems to highlight 'bright spots'. We find that, similar to terrestrial systems, restoration interventions can be effective over large spatial expanses (1,000s-100,000s ha), persist for decades, rapidly expand in size, be cost-effective, and generate social and economic benefits. These bright spots clearly demonstrate restoration of coastal marine systems can be used as a nature-based solution to improve biodiversity and support human health and wellbeing. Examining coastal marine restoration through a historical lens shows that it has developed over a shorter period than restoration in terrestrial systems, partially explaining lower efficiencies. Given these bright spots and the relative immaturity of coastal marine ecosystem restoration, it is likely to advance rapidly over the coming decades and become a common intervention strategy that can reverse marine degradation, contribute to local economies, and improve human wellbeing at a scale relevant to addressing global threats.

AB  - The transition from the current linear model of abstraction, use and discharge of water into recycle-reuse under the circular economy (CE) principles is momentous. An analysis of recent literature about the economic impact of linear to circular (L2C) transition is made. The review investigates the economic implications (i.e. cost-benefit) of deployment of enabling technologies, tools and methodologies within the circular water systems. The study is enhanced by presenting the results of our investigation into the policy impact (push-barriers) of L2C transition. As the vehicle for the L2C transition, nature-based solutions (NBS) and its economic and policy implications is discussed. A framework is proposed for the monetary assessment of the costs of investment in NBS technologies, infrastructure and education against the environmental and socio-economic benefits within the policy frameworks. This framework may build the early foundation for bridging the gap that exists for a systematic and objective economic impact (cost-benefit) analysis of L2C transition in the Water sector. This framework will lead to a generic multi-parametric cost model of NBS for Circularity Water Systems.

AB  - The supply of ecosystem services (ES) that benefit humanity are derived from multiple, interacting ecological functions and processes. Focusing on the ecological mechanisms that underpin ES delivery allows bundles of services to be identified, bridging a critical gap with management. Work in marine systems has not yet progressed to the identification of ES bundles, as a result of data scarcity and complications arising from system complexity and connectivity, as opposed to terrestrial systems where ES bundles have been more widely applied based on spatial clustering. To demonstrate the approach, identification of ES bundles provided by shellfish is used as a case-study. Shellfish provide a number of known ES that need to be strategically managed to ensure sustainable use. As a result of global degradations in shellfish beds ES have been lost, and restoration efforts emphasize the importance in regaining these services. A literature review, including 146 papers aimed specifically at linking shellfish to either ecosystem functions or ecosystem services, was conducted to establish key linkages between processes, functions and services. Based on co-occurrence of services and shared linkages, four bundles of services are identified, including Marine resources, Coastal health and quality, Habitat modification, and Biological structuring. Our study emphasizes the underpinning ecological mechanisms and the importance of interactions between services, expressed in the formation of bundles by mutual drivers and processes, as well as between services in different bundles, as either synergies or trade-offs. The approach enables the translation of ecological knowledge and creates generality to inform policy making and management, thereby providing a format useful for ecologists, managers and other stakeholders.

AB  - The successful implementation and sustainability of many marsh restoration efforts, including coastal adaptation to buffer inundation and mitigate sea level rise, often hinges upon support from surrounding human communities. Yet, stakeholder engagement in these projects remains relatively undervalued and underutilized. We present the Social-Ecological Systems, Adaptive Management, and Engagement (SESAME) framework that provides reciprocal connections between the human and ecological components of restoration efforts and the resulting management and engagement needs. We built and describe this framework through discussion of two case studies of coastal restoration efforts in southern New England salt marshes. The first case study focuses on the use of sediment placement to increase the elevation of the surface of a drowning marsh in Rhode Island as an interim measure to protect against sea level rise. The second case study describes the use of living shorelines for erosion mitigation on a salt marsh in Massachusetts. These cases included significant partner and stakeholder engagement and provided important lessons learned for practical implementation of the SESAME framework. Valuable lessons included the need for engagement throughout the entirety of the process, specific clarification of roles within the restoration efforts, and flexibility in implementation and goal setting.

AB  - The success of oyster reef restoration can be enhanced by data on the distribution of remnant populations to inform the selection of suitable restoration locations. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based environmental DNA (eDNA) assay was designed to provide distribution data for the oyster, Ostrea angasi, whose reefs are functionally extinct in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. Ostrea angasi eDNA accumulation and decay was measured in aquaria containing oysters in low and high densities, prior to testing the efficacy of the eDNA approach for detection of oysters at 15 field sites. Ostrea angasi eDNA accumulated significantly faster in aquaria where more individuals were present, while eDNA became undetectable 2–6 days after oysters were removed in low-density treatments. The eDNA samples were successful at detecting O. angasi in the field when taken in close proximity of an oyster population. Increasing the sample number and volume could maximize oyster detection, demonstrating the potential of eDNA to identify suitable sites for the restoration of functionally extinct marine ecosystems.

AB  - The study utilizes a coupled wave-surge-vegetation modeling system to quantify the effects of salt marsh vegetation on hurricane-generated waves. The wave model incorporates the energy dissipation model of Chen and Zhao (2012) for random waves over vegetation. The storm surge model incorporates the vegetal drag for both rigid and flexible types of vegetation. The surge and wave models with the vegetation effects are coupled, allowing the spatially and temporally varying vegetation heights, water levels and depth-averaged currents from the storm surge model to be fed into the wave model. Numerical experiments have revealed that vegetation can change the surge height and a storm surge can change the vegetation height. Both control the wave reduction rate in flooded wetlands. The impact of vegetation on hurricane-generated waves consists of indirect and direct effects. The former is caused by the changes in surge height due to vegetation. The latter comes from the direct interaction between vegetation and the oscillatory motion of surface waves. It has been found that flexible marsh vegetation deflects under the hydrodynamic force produced by a hurricane. The deflected height not only reduces the flow resistance in the surge model, but also decreases the energy dissipation caused by vegetation in the wave model. Consequently, neglecting plant flexibility may lead to overestimates of vegetation effects and exaggeration of wetland potential for flood risk reduction.

AB  - The study site is currently retreating at a rate of 20 m y−1 due to severe coastal erosion and found to be highly polluted as revealed from the water, sediment and biological analysis. In an attempt to prevent coastal erosion, 14,000 Rhizophora mucronata (RM) trees were planted across a heavily eroded shoreline at Samut Sakhon, Thailand. The survival rate of RM was high at the landward area and decreased at the offshore area. The most landward plot showed the highest survival rate when measured 4 years after planting (63.5%), while only 26.7% of trees survived at the most offshore plot. NPK and coconut fiber were shown to be significantly effective to enhance initial tree growths in heavily eroded area.

AB  - The spatial analysis of biota, particulate organic matter, and sediments for stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and sulfur (δ34S) have proved useful for identifying patterns in productivity, nutrient pollution, and relationships between biological and physiochemical variables at the local and global scales. Yet such approaches are rarely applied to studies of lagoon or estuarine metabolism. Focusing on Bahia San Quintin, a heterotrophic seagrass-dominated lagoon on the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico, we report on spatial patterns in surficial sediment CNS stable isotopic ratios as tracers of lagoon biogeochemical function. Stable nitrogen isotopes highlighted potential spatial variability in the balance between denitrification and nitrogen-fixation within the lagoon and identified an association between elevated δ15N levels and oyster culture, suggesting that oyster presence may be enhancing N2 production. Spatial patterns in δ34S covaried with sediment particle size, underlining the importance of sediment texture in determining the depth of sub-oxic-anoxic redox zones. Sediment carbon stable isotope ratios highlighted the lack of incorporation of seagrass carbon into seagrass meadow sediments, thus emphasizing the importance of phytoplankton or microphytobenthos for carbon accumulation in seagrass meadows. This report highlights the value of sediment isotopic values in corroborating spatial patterns in estuarine metabolism or macronutrient processing identified from chamber or flux-based studies. Stable isotope mapping can provide a useful addition to assessment of estuarine metabolism, or act as a stand-alone tool for generating hypotheses, identifying the influence of spatial gradients, and/or suggesting prime locations for investigation of microbial abundance or function.

AB  - The shoreline of Malaysia is exposed to threats of coastal erosion and a rise of sea level. The National Coastal Erosion Study, 2015 reported that 15% of an 8840 km shoreline is currently eroding, where one-third of those falls under the critical and significant categories that require structural protection. The Study of Sea Level Rise in Malaysia, 2017 presented a sea-level increase of 0.67–0.74 mm on average yearly. This study reviewed selected coastal protection structures along the shoreline of Malaysia as an erosion control and sea-level rise adaptation based on coastal management strategies. Hard structures such as rock revetment and breakwater are commonly used as erosion protection systems in the “hold the line” strategy. Increased platform level of seawalls and earth bunds, considered as an “adaptation” approach, are effective in erosion protection and are adaptive to sea-level rise. Mangrove replanting is suitable as a “limited intervention” approach in minimizing the long-term impact of both threats. However, offshore breakwater, groyne, and geotextile tubes are solely for protection purposes and are not as effective for sea-level rise adaptation. As the sea level is continuously increasing, their function as coastal protection will also become less effective. In summary, this comprehensive review on coastal protection in Malaysia will benefit the related agencies on the future assessment.

AB  - The Shoreline Management Model (SMM) is a novel geospatial approach used to assess conditions along a shoreline, and recommend best management practices for defended and undefended shorelines. The SMM models available spatial data in order to identify areas where the use of living shorelines would be suitable to address shoreline erosion. The model was developed to support and inform decision-making by shoreline managers responsible for management of shoreline resources, shorefront property owners, and tidal habitat restoration actions. Recommended erosion control strategies are based on scientific knowledge of how shorelines respond to natural conditions and anthropogenic measures used to stabilize shorelines. The SMM uses input variables representing current conditions and recommends a strategy that falls into one of three general categories: living shorelines, traditional approaches, and special considerations. Areas of special consideration are areas where the model may not be able to provide an appropriate recommendation due to ecological, geological, or highly developed conditions. These areas are given recommendations that include the instruction to seek expert advice. Data required to run the model include presence of tidal marsh, beach, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), riparian land cover, bank height, nearshore bathymetry, fetch, and shoreline erosion control structures. The model has been calibrated and validated along Virginia's Chesapeake Bay shoreline, USA. The model results are largely consistent with field recommendations (i.e., shoreline management recommendations made by scientists based on on-site observations during shoreline evaluation visits). The SMM performed with an overall accuracy of 82.5%. The SMM is exportable; the model code can be adapted to other systems. This geospatial model provides a robust screening tool for local and state governments, coastal and environmental planners and engineers, as well as property owners, when considering best management practices, including living shorelines as an alternative for erosion control. • SMM is a robust management tool that predicts where living shorelines are suitable. • SMM identifies best management practices for tidal shoreline erosion control. • Model outputs can be integrated into shoreline management plans and guidance documents.

AB  - The seascape context of coastal ecosystems plays a pivotal role in shaping patterns in fish recruitment, abundance, and diversity. It might also be a principal determinant in structuring the recruitment of fish assemblages to restored habitats, but the trajectories of these relationships require further testing. In this study, we surveyed fish assemblages from 14 restored oyster reefs and 14 control sites in the Noosa River, Queensland, Australia, that differed in the presence or absence of seagrass within 500 m, over four periods using baited cameras. Fish assemblages at oyster reefs differed from those at control sites, with higher species richness (1.4 times) and more individuals of taxa that are harvested by fishers (1.8 times). The presence or absence of seagrass nearby affected the abundance of a key harvestable fish species (yellowfin bream Acanthopagrus australis) on oyster reefs, but not the overall composition of fish assemblages, species richness, or the total abundance of harvestable fishes overall. These findings highlight the importance of considering species-specific patterns in seascape utilization when selecting restoration sites and setting restoration goals, and suggest that the effects of restoration on fish assemblages might be optimized by focusing efforts in prime positions in coastal seascapes.

AB  - The San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary, the largest estuary on the west coast of North America, has lost over 90% of its tidal wetlands through conversion to agriculture, grazing or urban development. Accelerated sea-level rise poses an additional threat to the remaining wetlands, and keeping pace requires that they increase in relative elevation through trapping of suspended sediment or increasing organic productivity in the root zone. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) have been declining in rivers and deep channels, and although little is known about sediment dynamics in shallow areas, sediment supply to tidal wetlands may not be sufficient to maintain their elevations in the future. Wetlands will be constrained by existing development and mountainous terrain. Increases in tidal wetland salinity have been occurring in saline, brackish and the western edges of freshwater tidal wetlands. To mitigate for sea-level rise, considerable acreages currently are being restored, with and without active management practices. Restoration techniques are being piloted to increase shoreline protection, resiliency, and high tide refuge in adaptation to current and projected sea level rise. We recommend additional research into plant physiological responses to combinations of climate change impacts, as well as suggest potential practical policy positions.

AB  - The resilience of socio-ecological systems to sea level rise, storms and flooding can be enhanced when coastal habitats are used as natural infrastructure. Grey infrastructure has long been used for coastal flood protection but can lead to unintended negative impacts. Natural infrastructure often provides similar services as well as added benefits that support short- and long-term biological, cultural, social, and economic goals. While natural infrastructure is becoming more widespread in practice, it often represents a relatively small fraction within portfolios of coastal risk-reducing strategies compared to more traditional grey infrastructure. This study provides a comprehensive review of how natural infrastructure is being used along the United States Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean coasts related to four habitats – tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and biogenic reefs. We compare information on the benefits, opportunities and challenges of implementing natural, grey and hybrid infrastructure in the coastal zone. In addition, we present a suite of actions to increase information and reduce uncertainty so that coastal mangers and planners are aware of the full suite of options for restoration, conservation and planning that maximize ecosystem services over short- and long-term planning horizons.

AB  - The rapid loss of estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) in recent years has raised concerns over their role in protecting coastal communities from storms that damage property, cause deaths and inflict injuries. This paper reviews valuation studies of the protective service of ECEs in terms of reducing flood damages. Although the number of studies have grown significantly, there is still a need for a greater range of studies in more locations and for a wider variety of ecosystems. This review also examines, from an economic perspective, the issues and challenges surrounding estimating the protective benefits of ECEs, as exemplified by some of the recent valuation studies. Recent developments in valuation methods are summarized and critically reviewed. Important challenges remain in valuing coastal ecosystems as a defence against flood damages. The review discusses two of them, such as how protective benefits are subject to spatial variability and dependent on connectivity across “seascapes”. These challenges, along with analysing the multiple benefits of estuarine and coastal ecosystems, are important areas of future research priority.

AB  - The rapid loss of coastal and estuarine biogenic habitats has reduced the delivery of valuable ecosystem services, resulting in calls for increased habitat restoration. Yet, a lack of information on how key habitat characteristics (e.g., area, vertical relief, age) influence the ability of restored habitats to deliver these ecosystem services hinders efforts to maximize the return on restoration investments. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the influence of reef type (natural or restored), taxa, and restored reef size, vertical relief, age, and tidal zone on the presence and magnitude of recruitment enhancement for nekton (i.e., fish and swimming crabs). Both intertidal and subtidal reefs, as well as restored and natural reefs, enhanced nekton recruitment, though there was variation among taxonomic groups with reef types. Recruitment enhancement was more common across taxa on restored (six families) than on natural (one family) reefs. Resident nekton families were more consistently enhanced than transient families. Nekton enhancement varied with a number of restored reef characteristics. Recruitment enhancement increased with greater reef size across taxa, decreased with higher vertical relief for two families, showed maximum recruitment around a single intertidal reef age for one family, and showed minimum recruitment around a single subtidal reef age for three families. Understanding variation across species in response to key design elements will improve restoration success and enhance return on investment. Moving forward, we recommend studies that vary reef habitat characteristics independently and in combination to identify how variation in these characteristics interact to influence nekton recruitment enhancement by oyster reefs.

AB  - The radial sandy ridge area along the Jiangsu coast has a complex topography with many tidal creeks and emerged ridges, which may induce a significant interaction between surge and waves when a typhoon is passing through this area. In this study, the ADCIRC and SWAN models are used to simulate the storm surge and typhoon waves during the period of Typhoon Damery which occurred in 2010. The interaction between the surge and waves is studied by comparing the simulated results obtained from the coupled ADCRIC+SWAN and uncoupled ADCIRC and SWAN models. A cyclic increase-and-decrease of significant wave height is found near the typhoon landing area, with the maximum change in the order of 1m, due to the tide and surge effect. A notable increase in the surge level is found on the nearshore emerged ridges as the typhoon passing by, with the maximum change in the order of 0.1m, due to the wave effect. It is also found that the interaction between the storm surge and typhoon waves is less significant in tidal creeks due to their relatively large water depth.

AB  - The quantitative analysis of hurricane impacts on coastal development in the Caribbean is surprisingly infrequent and many tools to assess physical vulnerability to sea level rise (SLR) are insufficient to evaluate risk in coastal areas exposed to wave attack during extreme events. This paper proposes a practical methodology to quantify coastal hazards and evaluate SLR impact scenarios in coastal areas, providing quantitative input for coastal vulnerability analysis. We illustrate the implementation of the proposed methodology with results from a site-specific analysis. We quantify how storm wave impacts penetrate farther inland and reach higher elevations for increasing SLR conditions. We also show that the increase in elevation of storm wave impacts is more than the nominal increase in mean sea level, and that elevation increase may be on the order of up to twice the nominal SLR. By developing design parameters for multiple scenarios, as opposed to the determination of a single SLR value for design established by consensus, this approach generates information that we argue encourages resilient design and embedding future adaptation in coastal design. We discuss how government planners and regulators, as well as real estate developers, lenders, and investors, can improve coastal planning and resilient design of coastal projects by using this approach.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand preferences for different coastal flood protection measures and the factors that influence such preferences, to inform management and policy. The Discrete Choice Experiment applied to Wales residents revealed that there is willingness-to-pay for coastal flood protection, especially through Nature-based Solutions (NbS) including expanding saltmarsh area and increasing saltmarsh with high vegetation. The preference for NbS provides evidence for including specific coastal area targets in financial schemes initially aimed at other benefits from natural habitats, such as habitat creation for biodiversity. This joint action will maximise the benefits from NbS and ensure integrated and concerted efforts across, often disjointed, sectors. There were also high levels of heterogeneity for preferences in different groups of people. For instance, results support that direct flood experience and damage severity can give rise to behavioural intentions that support mitigation and adaptation measures. Findings also highlight how crucial environmental education and direct contact with the object of study are for securing support and buy-in for flood protection measures. This work is original in that it considers the different types of management for a habitat as NbS and the heterogeneity of preferences within a population. Results are significant in providing a basis for future NbS developments and in supporting flood risk policy and management.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the historical loss and current shoreline habitat rehabilitation efforts along the urban-industrial Detroit River using geographical information system methods and a shoreline survey. This study found a 97% loss of historical coastal wetlands to human development. By 1985, 55% of the U.S. mainland shoreline had been hardened with steel sheet piling or concrete breakwater that provide limited habitat. Since 1995, 19 projects were implemented, improving 4.93 km of shoreline habitat. A comparison of the 1985 and 2015 georeferenced aerial imagery showed that 2.32 km of soft shoreline was also converted to hard shoreline during this timeframe. Of the 19 projects surveyed, 11 representing 3.35 km made habitat improvements to shoreline that was already georeferenced as “soft“, three representing 360 m converted shoreline from “hard” to “soft”, and five representing 1.22 km added incidental habitat to hardened shoreline. Even with the addition of 1.58 km of new soft shoreline and incidental habitat, there was an overall net loss of 0.74 km of soft shoreline over the 30-year timeframe. To reach the “good” state of at least 70% soft shoreline, an additional 12.1 km of soft shoreline will have to be added. This confirms that shoreline hardening continues despite the best efforts of resource managers and conservation organizations. Resource managers must become opportunistic and get involved up front in urban waterfront redevelopment projects to advocate for habitat. Incremental progress will undoubtedly be slow following adaptive management.

AB  - The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to study the reflection and transmission coefficients resulting from the interactions of regular waves with a rectangular breakwater sited at the bottom of a tank. The present investigation is devoted to the analysis of the reflection and transmission coefficients within the framework of linearized potential flow theory using two methods, a numerical method based on the improved version of the meshless singular boundary method, and the analytical approach within the plane wave model. The numerical method is first validated by studying the accuracy of the numerical computations with respect to the number of boundary nodes and the location of the vertical boundaries of the computational domain, for different immersion ratios (h/d) and different relative lengths (w/d) of the obstacle. To assess the limitations of the analytical approach, a comparison analysis is carried out between the analytical and numerical results. To improve the calculations and the effectiveness of the analytical model, slight adjustments are made to the analytical procedure, which is termed here the corrected analytical plane wave model. Finally, the effects of the immersion ratio (h/d) and the relative length (w/d) of the obstacle on the reflection and transmission coefficients are computed using the three methods, and discussed for several wave and structural conditions.

AB  - The problem of denoising a one-dimensional signal possessing varying degrees of smoothness is ubiquitous in time-domain astronomy and astronomical spectroscopy. For example, in the time domain, an astronomical object may exhibit a smoothly varying intensity that is occasionally interrupted by abrupt dips or spikes. Likewise, in the spectroscopic setting, a noiseless spectrum typically contains intervals of relative smoothness mixed with localized higher frequency components such as emission peaks and absorption lines. In this work, we present trend filtering, a modern nonparametric statistical tool that yields significant improvements in this broad problem space of denoising $spatially$ $heterogeneous$ signals. When the underlying signal is spatially heterogeneous, trend filtering is superior to any statistical estimator that is a linear combination of the observed data---including kernel smoothers, LOESS, smoothing splines, Gaussian process regression, and many other popular methods. Furthermore, the trend filtering estimate can be computed with practical and scalable efficiency via a specialized convex optimization algorithm, e.g. handling sample sizes of $n\gtrsim10^7$ within a few minutes. In a companion paper, we explicitly demonstrate the broad utility of trend filtering to observational astronomy by carrying out a diverse set of spectroscopic and time-domain analyses.

AB  - The present work aims to identify the changes in the macroinvertebrate community of the Tagus estuary (Portugal) due to improvements in water quality and to climate change. Data was collected over a period of 16 years (1998-2014) from different sites located along the estuarine gradient. The AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) was used to assess the ecological quality status based on benthic invertebrate communities and identify possible variations associated with changes in water quality. The overall distribution of each species was examined to detect possible changes associated with climate, based on species’ affinity for more temperate or subtropical climates. Results demonstrate that there was an overall improvement of AMBI scores during the assessment period. The analysis of the geographical distribution of benthic species seems to indicate that there has been an increase of species which prefer subtropical climates in the shallower waters of the estuary, whereas in the deeper estuarine sections the propensity is for an increase of species that prefer temperate climates.

AB  - The participation of the local population in the planning and management of biosphere reserves is one of the preconditions for success. While numerous studies underpin its importance, few studies have addressed to what extent participation is desired by local residents and which factors determine the level of participation. A postal survey among local residents (n = 449) explored factors influencing their willingness to participate in the planning and management of the Salzburger Lungau & Karntner Nockberge Biosphere Reserve in Austria before it was officially recognised by UNESCO. By applying the “Theory of Planned Behaviour”, the study found a high willingness to be involved among the local population, but a considerable variance as to what extent. Regression models showed a strong influence of perceived behavioural control and the social environment, whereas the factors identified in previous studies were less relevant. The results show that the readiness to become active seems to be higher than expected by local bodies and more linked to the design of the participatory process or other barriers. The results support the biosphere reserve management in developing appropriate participatory approaches to maximise satisfaction with participation and management success.

AB  - The need for sustainable and resilient long-term strategies for coastal restoration and development projects is largely the result of pressures brought by changing climate conditions and growing human populations along coastal boundaries. As anthropogenic impacts along our coasts increase, the demand for sustainable, nature-based solutions (NbS) will grow commensurately. Trusted approaches are needed for successful implementation of NbS, especially in regions hardest hit by environmental changes. Nearshore strategies for new construction and protection of existing coastal infrastructure are shifting rapidly from hardened approaches to more ecologically aligned techniques that work with natural forces and enhance natural habitat. This paper highlights the benefits of living shorelines composed of ecotypic native plants, wave attenuation structures for coastal protection, and managed retreat to restore coastal environments while supporting and maintaining natural habitats. We review several NbS and present two case studies to illustrate the value of incorporating nature-based approaches to vulnerable coastal environments and highlight the importance of maximizing synergies and understanding trade-offs in their long-term use.

AB  - The need for comprehensive and effective coral restoration projects, as part of a broader conservation management strategy, is accelerating in the face of coral reef ecosystem decline. This study aims to expand the currently limited knowledge base for restoration techniques in the Maldives by testing the performance of mid-water rope nurseries in a lagoon and a reef habitat. We examined whether different coral farming habitats impacted fragment survival, health and growth of two coral genera and how the occurrence of mutualistic fauna, predation and disease influenced coral rearing success. Two nurseries were stocked with a total of 448 <i>Pocillopora verrucosa</i> and 96 <i>Acropora</i> spp. fragments, divided into different groups (four <i>Pocillopora</i> groups: lagoon nursery at 5 m; reef nursery at 5, 10 and 15 m; two <i>Acropora</i> groups: lagoon nursery at 5 m and reef nursery at 5 m). Eight fragment replicates from the same donor colony (<i>Pocillopora</i> genets: <i>N</i> = 14, <i>Acropora</i> genets <i>N</i> = 6) were used in each group and monitored for one year. Our results show that fragment survival was high in both farming habitats (>90%), with <i>P. verrucosa</i> surviving significantly better in the lagoon and <i>Acropora</i> spp. surviving and growing significantly faster in the reef nursery. <i>P. verrucosa</i> growth rates were similar between reef and lagoon habitat. Different rearing depths in the reef nursery had no impact on the survival of <i>P. verrucosa</i> but coral growth decreased considerably with depth, reducing fragments' ecological volume augmentation and growth rates by almost half from 5 to 15 m depth. Further, higher fish predation rates on fragments were recorded on the reef, which did not impact overall nursery performance. Mutualistic fauna, which correlated positively with fragment survival, was more frequently observed in the lagoon nursery. The occurrence of disease was noted in both habitats, even though implications for fragment health were more severe in the lagoon. Overall, our study demonstrates that lagoon and reef nurseries are suitable for rearing large numbers of coral fragments for transplantation. Nevertheless, we recommend considering the specific environmental conditions of the farming habitat, in particular water quality and year-round accessibility, in each case and to adjust the coral farming strategy accordingly. We hope that this novel research encourages the increased application of mid-water rope nurseries for 'coral gardening' to advance coral reef recovery and climate resilience in the Maldives.

AB  - The nearshore land-water interface is an important ecological zone that faces anthropogenic pressure from development in coastal regions throughout the world. Coastal waters and estuaries like Chesapeake Bay receive and process land discharges loaded with anthropogenic nutrients and other pollutants that cause eutrophication, hypoxia, and other damage to shallow-water ecosystems. In addition, shorelines are increasingly armored with bulkhead (seawall), riprap, and other structures to protect human infrastructure against the threats of sea-level rise, storm surge, and erosion. Armoring can further influence estuarine and nearshore marine ecosystem functions by degrading water quality, spreading invasive species, and destroying ecologically valuable habitat. These detrimental effects on ecosystem function have ramifications for ecologically and economically important flora and fauna. This special issue of Estuaries and Coasts explores the interacting effects of coastal land use and shoreline armoring on estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. The majority of papers focus on the Chesapeake Bay region, USA, where 50 major tributaries and an extensive watershed (~ 167,000 km2), provide an ideal model to examine the impacts of human activities at scales ranging from the local shoreline to the entire watershed. The papers consider the influence of watershed land use and natural versus armored shorelines on ecosystem properties and processes as well as on key natural resources.

AB  - The Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) extends alongshore, from Cape Cod, MA to Cape Hatteras, NC and includes major estuarine systems such as Narragansett Bay, Long Island Sound, Chesapeake Bay and Pamlico Sound. Sea level rise continues to have a dramatic effect on developed watersheds and urban estuaries, which are common to this highly populated region. Tropical cyclones contribute to flooding, which impacts coastal roads, homes, farms, and even fresh water supplies. Research is being applied to improve our understanding of the physical processes that connect estuaries and the coastal ocean and better forecast floods. Advances will result in improved marine policies and coastal resilience.

AB  - The loss of salt-marsh habitat is proceeding at an alarming rate worldwide, resulting in the loss of ecosystem function and reduced exchange with adjacent habitats. The immediate result of shoreline erosion is the loss of fringing vegetation, but it is unclear how, and at what temporal scale, intertidal floral zones respond to shoreline loss. Using a transect-based approach over a 3 yr period, we compared community composition among 3 intertidal salt marshes in coastal Alabama that differ in the intensity of wave-generated disturbance. Each study marsh exhibited net annual rates of shoreline retreat, but differed in its exposure to wave-induced disturbance and erosional state. We also examined whether wave attenuation by oyster break waters reduced annual rates of shoreline erosion, providing a means to test whether the intensity of shoreline erosion affects inter-annual patterns of marsh zonation. Community composition differed across sites, but not between breakwater treatments and site-specific rates of shoreline loss, suggesting that differences in community composition are not due to differences in erosion intensity, but to other contrasts across sites. The cohesive nature of the floral communities at each site suggests that marshes maintain their zonation structure by migrating inland as the shoreline recedes. The inland migration of marsh zones will, however, ultimately be limited by the lack of area available for marsh colonization. The preservation of coastal salt marshes is, therefore, vitally contingent on effective shoreline management strategies.

AB  - The linkages between ecosystem conditions and disaster risk reduction have gained increasing international attention. Despite this growing awareness, national and local decision makers often lack the tools to visualize disaster risk under different ecosystem conditions. As a result, the importance of ecosystems continues to be under-appreciated in decision-making processes related to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. While spatial models have commonly been applied in both ecological assessments and disaster management, there have been relatively few studies that merge these two applications. This chapter demonstrates applications of the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) tool in data-deficient countries where the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is currently implementing ecosystem-based field interventions to reduce disaster risk. InVEST software (developed by the Natural Capital Project) provides spatial tools for assessing ecosystems and disaster risk even when limited data is available. The first study presented in this chapter takes into consideration the role of coastal and marine ecosystems in reducing exposure to coastal hazards in a small municipality in the south of Haiti. It provides an example of a qualitative assessment of exposure to storm surges and coastal flooding under different ecosystem management scenarios. The second study examines realistic land use change scenarios such as reforestation and urbanization and their impacts on soil erosion and sedimentation in a river basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Through detailed examination of the two case studies, this chapter aims to demonstrate how integrated models such as InVEST could function as decision-support tools for considering ecosystem-based solutions for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The limitations, challenges and areas for improvement of each model application, as well as implications for local decision-making and awareness-raising, are discussed.

AB  - The last few decades have seen rapid proliferation of hard artificial structures (e.g., energy infra-structure, aquaculture, coastal defences) in the marine environment: ocean sprawl. The replacement of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native species at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment—the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity of artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner. The challenge now is to manage ocean sprawl with the dual goal of supporting human populations and activities, simultaneously strengthening ecosystem resilience using an ecosystem- based approach

AB  - The interaction between mangroves and storm surges is explored using an analytical solution. A simplified momentum equation, balancing vegetation drag and pressure gradient, is combined with the continuity equation resulting in a diffusion equation. Assuming a simplified environment, a one‐dimensional analytical solution is obtained to predict peak surge level across a forest. The solution accurately reproduces peak water level of a 10‐year return period flood event in mangroves in the Firth of Thames, New Zealand, and in Ten Thousand Islands, Florida, during Hurricane Charley. Vegetation properties that determine the capacity of mangroves to reduce surges are forest density and cross‐shore extent. Storm characteristics—flood duration and peak water level at the forest fringe—also influence surge attenuation. Mangroves are shown to be an effective form of coastal flood protection if forests are sufficiently wide/dense, relative to the surge decay length scale, to restrict water exchange during a storm.

AB  - The important role of coral reefs in protecting people, economies and infrastructure is widely acknowledged. Coral reefs are highly effective at reducing wave energy and thereby diminishing the impact of both flooding and erosion in coastal areas. Understanding these benefits, and their spatial distribution, can play a critical role in driving efforts to protect or even restore coral reefs, with critical societal benefits. Simple, high-resolution models were used to generate a global map which suggests that 26 % of the coastline of the world’s coral reef nations receive some protection benefits, and that, over decadal periods some 5.3 million people and $109 billion of GDP are protected by coral reefs. Separate maps show the values at the shore and plot the reefs providing those values. Differences exist between metrics (population, GDP and night-time lights as a metric for infrastructure) raising the importance of considering ecosystem service values with multiple metrics, including non-monetary values. Patterns of protection are highly heterogeneous, however many of the most important areas are adjacent to highly developed shores and many of these receive little or no management attention. • Coral reefs play a critical role in coastal protection world-wide. • Proximity based models reveal 26 % of coasts in reef nations receive some protection. • Reefs safeguard 5.3 million people and $109 billion of economic value per decade. • Nearshore fringing reefs, in areas of high reef density are key to protection. • Protected areas provide only limited coverage of these critical services.

AB  - The importance of restoring filter-feeders, such as the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, to mitigate the effects of eutrophication (e.g. in Chesapeake Bay) is currently under debate. The argument that bivalve molluscs alone cannot control phytoplankton blooms and reduce hypoxia oversimplifies a more complex issue, namely that ecosystem engineering species make manifold contributions to ecosystem services. Although further discussion and research leading to a more complete understanding is required, oysters and other molluscs (e.g. mussels) in estuarine eco- systems provide services far beyond the mere top-down control of phytoplankton blooms, such as (1) seston filtration, (2) benthic-pelagic coupling, (3) creation of refugia from predation, (4) creation of feeding habitat for juveniles and adults of mobile species, and for sessile stages of species that attach to molluscan shells, and (5) provision of nesting habitat.

AB  - The importance of intertidal estuarine habitats, like salt marsh and oyster reef, has been well established, as has their ubiquitous loss along our coasts with resultant forfeiture of the ecosystem services they provide. Furthering our understanding of how these habitats are evolving in the face of anthropogenic and climate driven changes will help improve management strategies. Previous work has shown that the growth and productivity of both oyster reefs and salt marshes are strongly linked to elevation in the intertidal zone (duration of aerial exposure). We build on that research by examining the growth of marsh-fringing oyster reefs at yearly to decadal time scales and examine movement of the boundary between oyster reef and salt marsh at decadal to centennial time scales. We show that the growth of marsh-fringing reefs is strongly associated to the duration of aerial exposure, with little growth occurring below mean low water and above mean sea level. Marsh-shoreline movement, in the presence or absence of fringing oyster reefs, was reconstructed using transects of sediment cores. Carbonaceous marsh sediments sampled below the modern fringing oyster reefs indicate that marsh shorelines within Back Sound, North Carolina are predominantly in a state of transgression (landward retreat), and modern oyster-reef locations were previously occupied by salt marsh within the past two centuries. Cores fronting transgressive marsh shorelines absent fringing reefs sampled thinner and less extensive carbonaceous marsh sediment than at sites with fringing reefs. This indicates that fringing reefs are preserving carbonaceous marsh sediment from total erosion as they transgress and colonize the exposed marsh shoreline making marsh sediments more resistant to erosion. The amount of marsh sediment preservation underneath the reef scales with the reef’s relief, as reefs with the greatest relief were level with the marsh platform, preserving a maximum amount of carbonaceous sediments during transgression by buffering the marsh from erosional processes. Thus, fringing oyster reefs not only have the capacity to shelter shorelines but, if located at the ideal tidal elevation, they also keep up with accelerating sea-level rise and cap carbonaceous sediments, protecting them from erosion, as reefs develop along the marsh.

AB  - The impact of boat traffic on the health of coastal ecosystems is a multi-scale process: from minutes (individual wakes) to days (tidal modulation of sediment transport), to seasons and years (traffic is seasonal). A considerable numerical effort, notwithstanding the value of a boat-by-boat numerical modeling approach, is questionable, because of the practical impossibility of specifying the exact type and navigation characteristics for every boat comprising the traffic at any given time. Here, we propose a statistical-mechanics description of the traffic using a joint probability density of the wake population in some characteristic parameter space. We attempt to answer two basic questions: (1) what is the relevant parameter space and (2) how should a numerical model be tested for a wake population? We describe the linear and nonlinear characteristics of wakes observed in the Florida Intracoastal Waters. Adopting provisionally a two-dimensional parameter space (depth- and length-based Froude numbers) we conduct numerical simulations using the open-source FUNWAVE-TVD Boussinesq model. The model performance is excellent for weakly-dispersive, completely specified wakes (e.g., the analytical linear wakes), and also for the range of Froude numbers observed in the field, or for large container ships generating relatively long waves. The model is challenged by the short waves generated by small, slow boats. However, simulations suggest that the problem is confined to the deeper water domain and linear evolution. Nonlinear wake shoaling, essential for modeling wake-induced sediment transport and wake impact on the environment, is described well.

AB  - The idea of nature providing solutions to societal challenges is relatively easy to understand by the layperson. Nature-based solutions (NBS) against landslides and erosion mostly comprise plant-based interventions in which the reinforcement of slopes provided by vegetation plays a crucial role in natural hazard prevention and mitigation, and in the provision of multiple socio-ecological benefits. However, the full potential of NBS against landslides and erosion is not realised yet because a strong evidence base on their multi-functional performance is lacking, hindering the operational rigour of NBS practice and science. This knowledge gap can be addressed through the definition of repositories of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics, which should stem from holistic frameworks facilitating the multi-functional assessment of NBS. Herein, we propose the ‘rocket framework’ to promote the uptake of NBS against landslides and erosion through the provision of a comprehensive set of indicators which, through their appropriate selection and measurement, can contribute to build a robust evidence base on NBS performance. The 'rocket framework’ is holistic, reproducible, dynamic, versatile, and flexible in helping define metrics for NBS actions against landslides and erosion along the NBS project timeline. The framework, resultant from an iterative research approach applied in a real-world environment, follows a hierarchical approach to deal with multiple scales and environmental contexts, and to integrate environmental, eco-engineering, and socio-ecological domains, thus establishing a balance between monitoring the engineering performance of NBS actions against landslides and erosion, and the wider provision of ecosystem functions and services. Using a case study, and following the principles of credibility, salience, legitimacy, and feasibility, we illustrate herein how the 'rocket framework’ can be effectively employed to define a repository with over 40 performance indicators for monitoring NBS against landslides and erosion, and with over 60 metrics for establishing the context and baseline upon which the NBS are built and encourage their reproduction and upscaling.

AB  - The hypothesis that equilibrium beach profiles under non‐breaking waves minimize wave energy dissipation was considered by Larson et al. (1999 Coast. Eng. 36 59‐85). Larson et al. approached the hypothesis as a variational problem, assuming a priori that the solution (the extremal profile) followed a power law with a freely‐tunable exponent, which was varied so as to extremize the relevant functional. Here, we revisit this hypothesis and solve the associated variational problem approximately via analytical means, without a priori assumptions on the mathematical structure of the solution. We remark that for the solution to be realistic, the problem formulation must consider additional constraints; for example, the bed slope angle must not exceed the sediment's angle of repose. Incidentally, the solution we derive recovers the power law prescribed by Larson et al., which is in turn backed by a large body of empirical evidence. However, the exponent of the power in our solution is not an arbitrarily free parameter; it depends on the parametrisation of the bed shear stress (the main mechanism by which non‐breaking waves dissipate energy), and predicted values of the exponent are supported by previous research. The power‐law curve derived here agrees well with empirical data from field and laboratory, suggesting that a principle of energy economy may indeed underpin the particular shape adopted by beach profiles under non‐breaking waves. This theoretical study aims at promoting and aiding further tests of this hypothesis

AB  - The human population is increasingly reliant on the marine environment for food, trade, tourism, transport, communication and other vital ecosystem services. These services require extensive marine infrastructure, all of which have direct or indirect ecological impacts on marine environments. The rise in global marine infrastructure has led to light, noise and chemical pollution, as well as facilitation of biological invasions. As a result, marine systems and associated species are under increased pressure from habitat loss and degradation, formation of ecological traps and increased mortality, all of which can lead to reduced resilience and consequently increased invasive species establishment. Whereas the cumulative bearings of collective human impacts on marine populations have previously been demonstrated, the multiple impacts associated with marine infrastructure have not been well explored. Here, building on ecological literature, we explore the impacts that are associated with marine infrastructure, conceptualising the notion of correlative, interactive and cumulative effects of anthropogenic activities on the marine environment. By reviewing the range of mitigation approaches that are currently available, we consider the role that eco-engineering, marine spatial planning and agent-based modelling plays in complementing the design and placement of marine structures to incorporate the existing connectivity pathways, ecological principles and complexity of the environment. Because the effect of human-induced, rapid environmental change is predicted to increase in response to the growth of the human population, this study demonstrates that the development and implementation of legislative framework, innovative technologies and nature-informed solutions are vital, preventative measures to mitigate the multiple impacts associated with marine infrastructure.

AB  - The habitat and feeding environment of freshwater fish in freshwater lakes have been destroyed, with the problem of miniaturization and simplification of catches being serious. An artificial reef is an effective technical measure to protect and proliferate offshore fishery resources, but little research has been conducted on its application in freshwater lakes. A small artificial reef for freshwater lakes was designed according to the water depth of the lake and the habits of benthic fish. The artificial reef is composed of biomass modules, each of which is 900 × 120 mm. The community structure of phytoplankton around the artificial reef and its adjacent waters was studied. The results showed that 77 species from seven phyla were identified, with a high number of species from the Chlorophyceae. In terms of density composition, the density of cyanobacteria decreased month by month, while the phylum Chlorophyta and Cryptophyta increased first and then decreased. As for biomass composition, Chlorophyta and Cryptophyta increased first and then decreased. RDA analysis showed that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and total phosphorus were the main influencing factors. To sum up, the artificial reef can improve the algae phase in the surrounding water column, inhibit the growth and reproduction of cyanobacteria to a certain extent, and have a significant enrichment and promotion effect on diatoms. Artificial fish reef affects the phytoplankton community structure of the surrounding water bodies mainly through the absorption of phosphorus nutrients. Artificial reefs can be popularized and applied in freshwater lakes to provide foraging and shelter for benthic fish in the lake.

AB  - The Gulf of Mannar (GoM) in southeast India is known for its coral reefs and associated biodiversity. Multiple coral bleaching events driven by global climate change and subsequent space competition have damaged the coral reefs of GoM during the past couple of decades. Certain marine sponges are space competitors to corals and can outgrow corals by overgrowing. Spongivore fishes play vital role in regulating sponge abundance in a reef. The present study was aimed to identify spongivore fishes at Pattinamaruthoor patch reef (55.25% coral cover) in Tuticorin coast of GoM. Gut content analysis and underwater assessment were carried out between March and September 2019. Known spongivores such as Apolemichthys xanthurus, Pomacanthus annularis and P. imperator had about 75, 50 and 80% of their diet as sponge. Other fishes such as Sargocentron rubrum (30%), Myripristis murdjan (30%) and Scarus ghobban (10%) were also found to feed on sponges which are not regular sponge feeders. It is presumed that increased availability of sponges as a result of climate change has made these fishes opportunistically feed on sponges. A total of 58 reef fish species including obligate and opportunistic sponge feeders were observed at Pattinamaruthoor patch reef. Protection of spongivore fishes from overexploitation is critical as it could allow corals to recover from climate change implications.

AB  - The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing “ocean sprawl”. Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

AB  - The global decline of coral reefs has driven considerable interest in active coral restoration. Despite their importance and dominance on mature reefs, relatively few coral restoration projects use slower growth forms like massive and encrusting coral species. Micro-fragmentation can increase coral cover by orders of magnitude faster than natural growth, which now allows cultivation of slow growing massive forms and shows promise and flexibility for active reef restoration. However, the major causes of variation in growth and survival of outplanted colonies remain poorly understood. Here, we report simple outplanting assays to aid in active reef restoration of slower growing species and increase the likelihood of restoration success. We used two different micro-fragmentation assays. Pyramid assays were used to examine variation associated with fragment size (ranging from ≈1-9 cm<sup>2</sup>), nursery residence time (for both <i>in-situ</i> and <i>ex-situ</i> nurseries), and 2D <i>vs</i>. 3D measurements of growth. Block assays were used to examine spatial variation among individual performance at outplanting sites in the field. We found 2D and 3D measurements correlated well, so measured survivorship and growth using top-down planar images for two of the main Hawaiian reef building corals, the plating <i>Montipora capitata</i> and the massive <i>Porites compressa</i>. Pyramid assays housed and outplanted from the <i>in-situ</i> nursery showed no effect of residence time or size on overall survivorship or growth for either species. Results from the <i>ex-situ</i> nursery, however, varied by species, with <i>P. compressa</i> again showing no effect of nursery residence time or size on survivorship or growth. In contrast, nursery culture resulted in improved survivorship of small <i>M. capitata</i> fragments, but net growth showed a weak positive effect of nursery time for medium fragments. Small fragments still suffered higher mortality than either medium or large fragments. Due to their lower mortality, medium fragments (≈3 cm<sup>2</sup>) appear to be the best compromise between growth and survivorship for outplanting. Likewise, given weak positive gains relative to the investment, our results suggest that it could be more cost-effective to simply outplant medium fragments as soon as possible, without intermediate culture in a nursery. Furthermore, the block assay revealed significant differences in survivorship and growth among sites for individuals of both species, emphasizing the importance of considering spatial variation in coral survival and growth following outplanting. These results highlight the value of using short-term micro-fragmentation assays prior to outplanting to assess size, and location specific performance, optimizing the efficiency of active reef restoration activities and maximizing the probability of success for active coral restoration projects.

AB  - The future impacts of climate change on landfalling tropical cyclones are unclear. Regardless of this uncertainty, flooding by tropical cyclones will increase as a result of accelerated sea-level rise. Under similar rates of rapid sea-level rise during the early Holocene epoch most low-lying sedimentary coastlines were generally much less resilient to storm impacts. Society must learn to live with a rapidly evolving shoreline that is increasingly prone to flooding from tropical cyclones. These impacts can be mitigated partly with adaptive strategies, which include careful stewardship of sediments and reductions in human-induced land subsidence.

AB  - The ecosystem services afforded by coastal wetlands are threatened by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. The Kennedy Space Center and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida offer a representative site for investigating how changes to vegetation distribution interact with management to impact coastal protection. Here, salt marshes are converting to mangroves, and mosquito impoundment structures are being modified. The resulting changes to vegetation composition and topography influence coastal protection services in wetlands. We used a model-based assessment of wave attenuation and erosion to compare vegetation (mangrove, salt marsh) and impoundment state (intact, graded). Our findings suggest that the habitat needed to attenuate 90% of wave height is significantly larger for salt marshes than mangroves. Erosion prevention was significantly higher (470%) in scenarios with mangroves than in salt marshes. Intact berms attenuated waves over shorter distances, but did not significantly reduce erosion. Differences in coastal protection were driven more by vegetation than by impoundment state. Overall, our findings reveal that mangroves provide more coastal protection services, and therefore more coastal protection value, than salt marshes in east central Florida. Other coastal regions undergoing similar habitat conversion may also benefit from increased coastal protection in the future.

AB  - The ecological value of engineered marine structures can be enhanced by building-in additional habitat complexity. Pre-fabricated habitat units can be cheaply and easily cast from concrete into heterogeneous three-dimensional shapes and surface topographies, with proven ability to enhance biodiversity on artificial structures. The net ecological benefits of enhancement using concrete, however, may be compromised on account of its large environmental footprint and poor performance as substrate for many marine organisms. We carried out a pilot study to trial alternative cast-able “Reefcrete” concrete mixes, with reduced environmental footprints, for use in the marine environment. We used partial replacement of Portland cement with recycled ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), and partial replacement of coarse aggregate with hemp fibres and recycled shell material. We calculated the estimated carbon footprint of each concrete blend and deployed replicate tiles in the intertidal environment for 12 months to assess their performance as substrate for marine biodiversity. The hemp and shell concrete blends had reduced carbon footprints compared to both ordinary Portland cement based concrete and the GGBS based control concrete used in this study. At the end of the experiment, the hemp and shell blends supported significantly more live cover than the standard GGBS control blend. Taxon richness, particularly of mobile fauna, was also higher on the hemp concrete than either the shell or GGBS control. Furthermore, the overall species pool recorded on the hemp concrete was much larger. Community compositions differed significantly on the hemp tiles, compared to GGBS controls. This was largely explained by higher abundances of several taxa, including canopy-forming algae, which may have facilitated other taxa. Our findings indicate that the alternative materials trialled in this study provided substrate of equal or better habitat suitability compared to ordinary GGBS based concrete. Given the growing interest in ecological engineering of marine infrastructure, we propose there would be great benefit in further development of these alternative “Reefcrete” materials for wider application.

AB  - The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is a foundation species within US Gulf of Mexico (GoM) estuaries that has experienced substantial population declines. As changes from management and climate are expected to continue to impact estuarine salinity, understanding how local oyster populations might respond and identifying populations with adaptations to more extreme changes in salinity could inform resource management, including restoration and aquaculture programs. Wild oysters were collected from four estuarine sites from Texas [Packery Channel (PC): 35.5, annual mean salinity, Aransas Bay (AB): 23.0] and Louisiana [Calcasieu Lake (CL): 16.2, Vermilion Bay (VB): 7.4] and spawned. The progeny were compared in field and laboratory studies under different salinity regimes. For the field study, F1 oysters were deployed at low (6.4) and intermediate (16.5) salinity sites in Alabama. Growth and mortality were measured monthly. Condition index and Perkinsus marinus infection intensity were measured quarterly. For the laboratory studies, mortality was recorded in F1 oysters that were exposed to salinities of 2.0, 4.0, 20.0/22.0, 38.0 and 44.0 with and without acclimation. The results of the field study and laboratory study with acclimation indicated that PC oysters are adapted to high-salinity conditions and do not tolerate very low salinities. The AB stock had the highest plasticity as it performed as well as the PC stock at high salinities and as well as Louisiana stocks at the lowest salinity. Louisiana stocks did not perform as well as the Texas stocks at high salinities. Results from the laboratory studies without salinity acclimation showed that all F1 stocks experiencing rapid mortality at low salinities when 3-month oysters collected at a salinity of 24 were used and at both low and high salinities when 7-month oysters collected at a salinity of 14.5 were used.

AB  - The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is prolific and their reefs are dominant features along the estuaries and coastal areas in the Gulf of Mexico including those along the Southwest Florida coast. This paper examines the ecological and indirect economic value of oysters and the ecosystem services they provide. Drivers of change in reefs as well as various factors (pressures) that affect oyster reefs are examined. Using the monitoring data from on-going studies, this study examined various metrics of oyster health, reproduction and survival to develop an index to create an overall state of oyster reefs in the Southwest Florida estuaries. Based on existing data, oyster reefs in Southwest Florida estuaries are at “caution”, but stable. Restoration of a more natural freshwater inflow, minimizing nutrient and contaminant input as well as decreased sedimentation will enable oyster reefs to expand and thrive.

AB  - The Eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica is a temperate reef-building bivalve that provides an array of ecosystem services. Efforts to restore Eastern Oyster have been increasing, highlighting the need for standardized monitoring metrics across projects and regions. Our objective was to estimate the efficiency of hydraulic patent tongs for estimating Eastern Oyster density on restoration sites in Harris Creek, Maryland. We sampled Eastern Oysters using a diver and hydraulic patent tongs and estimated differences in density estimates between the two gears using a mixed effects generalized linear model. On average, density estimates from hydraulic patent tongs were only 30% of those from the diver, which was substantially lower than previous studies. Given the widespread use of hydraulic patent tongs in oyster research and management, a better understanding of the efficiency of hydraulic patent tongs is needed.

AB  - The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a keystone species in the estuaries of the mid-Atlantic of the United States. Its population experienced drastic declines in the last century due to overfishing, habitat loss, and disease. Much interest has been focused on restoring this important commercial and ecological species. This research focused on evaluating the suitability of using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) from road projects as an alternative bottom conditioning material for oyster restoration and aquaculture in the Chesapeake Bay. Three types of substrate (RCA, natural oyster shell, and RCA with a veneer of oyster shell) were used as bottom conditioning materials and tested their impacts on benthic epifaunal community and oyster recruitment at two sites in the Chesapeake Bay over the summer and fall of 2013. The diversity and abundance of the epifaunal community, and oyster spat density associated with these bottom conditioning materials were sampled. The results showed there was no significant difference across substrate type (RCA, oyster shell, and RCA with oyster shell) in terms of their impacts on benthic community diversity and oyster recruitment, demonstrating that RCA, as an alternative material, was generally similar to natural oyster shell with regards to ecosystem services provided, and could be a potential source for much needed bottom substrate for oyster restoration and aquaculture.

AB  - The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the reefs they create provide significant ecosystem services. This study measured their possible role in nutrient mitigation through bioassimilation, burial, and oyster-mediated sediment denitrification in near-shore shallow water (  1 m water depth) oyster reefs in Louisiana. Nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in shell and tissue differed by oyster reproductive status, size, and habitat type. Changes in tissue percent N and C post-spawning combined with significant reductions in tissue dry weight from the release of gametes, resulted in 20 and 46% reductions in tissue N and C load (mg), respectively, for a 100-mm oyster. Oyster reefs did not enhance burial rates, with burial range rates estimated at 1.4–2.6 g N m−2 year−1, and 26.9–43.8 g C m−2 year−1. Closed-system ex situ incubations indicated net denitrification in all habitat types studied, with the highest rates exceeding 600 µmol N m−2 h−1 during the summer, but no enhancement attributable to oyster reefs specifically. Within the highly productive, organic-rich wetland complex systems of coastal Louisiana, oyster reefs were not associated with enhanced denitrification, likely due to the organic-rich setting, and redundant supplies of organic nitrogen and carbon from adjacent marshes. Context remains critical in determining ecosystem provision of habitats, and efforts to extrapolate and predict nitrogen removal across locations necessitates consideration of local conditions. Considering the large extent of reefs and oyster production across coastal Louisiana, oyster habitats may still contribute to N and C mitigation, but their unique contribution likely comes from bioassimilation, and removal of the oysters from the system.

AB  - The Earth’s climate is changing; ice sheets and glaciers are melting and coastal hazards and sea level are rising in response. With a total population of over 300 million people situated on coasts, including 20 of the planet’s 33 megacities (over 10 million people), low-lying coastal areas represent one of the most vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate change. Many of the largest cities along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. are already experiencing frequent high tide flooding, and these events will increase in frequency, depth, duration and extent as sea levels continue to rise at an accelerating rate throughout the 21st century and beyond. Cities in southeast Asia and islands in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean are also suffering the effects of extreme weather events combined with other factors that increase coastal risk. While short-term extreme events such as hurricanes, El Ninos and severe storms come and go and will be more damaging in the short term, sea-level rise is a long-term permanent change of state. However, the effects of sea-level rise are compounded with other hazards, such as increased wave action or a loss of ecosystems. As sea-level rise could lead to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people, this may be one of the greatest challenges that human civilization has ever faced, with associated inundation of major cities, loss of coastal infrastructure, increased saltwater intrusion and damage to coastal aquifers among many other global impacts, as well as geopolitical and legal implications. While there are several short-term responses or adaptation options, we need to begin to think longer term for both public infrastructure and private development. This article provides an overview of the status on adaptation to climate change in coastal zones.

AB  - The dynamic coastlines in the Lower Mekong Delta of Vietnam are threatened by the impacts of climate change, particularly by the increased intensity and frequency of storms and floods, as well as by rising sea levels. The most effective coastal protection systems consist of different elements arranged in series, for instance natural floodplains vegetated with mangroves and a sound dyke line. However, the unsustainable use of natural resources and development in the coastal zone are threatening the protection function of the mangrove forest belt. In sites where severe erosion has destroyed the mangrove belt, restoration of floodplains and mangrove rehabilitation is only possible after the wave energy has been reduced by physical barriers. This can be achieved with bamboo fences, which reduce erosion and stimulate sedimentation. Restoration of the eroded floodplains creates the pre-conditions for rehabilitation of the destroyed mangrove forest. Mangrove management is an important element of an area costal protection strategy.

AB  - The Diadema antillarum population in the Florida Keys has not recovered since the Caribbean-wide mass mortality event of the early 1980s. Concomitantly, coral reefs have degraded to the point that there has been a loss of habitat complexity and thus of refuge from predation, possibly creating a bottleneck to the recovery of D. antillarum. With interest rising in using D. antillarum in coral reef ecosystem restoration, we initiated this study to investigate some factors that may limit the survival of D. antillarum. First, we conducted a field experiment to determine whether D. antillarum survival was size-specific by tethering urchins from four size classes (test diameters: 21–30 mm, 31–40 mm, 41–50 mm, and ≥51 mm) on a degraded, offshore reef. We found that size did not offer any protection against predation as there was no difference in survival among size classes. Next, we tethered another set of urchins, approximately 60 mm in test diameter, at the same location but provided half with artificial shelter in the form of halved terracotta flowerpots. We found that urchins that were provided artificial shelter had significantly higher survival than those that did not have access to artificial shelter. Finally, because certain behaviors in D. antillarum are density-dependent, we conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate whether D. antillarum sheltering behavior was also density dependent. This experiment showed that sheltering behavior decreased significantly as stocking density increased. Our results indicate that restoration practitioners must be cognizant of and facilitate urchin behaviors that maximize survival (e.g., shelter use) and, more importantly, that successful restoration of D. antillarum in Florida will require that suitable refuge be available, either in the form of overhead cover provided by highly rugose reef habitat or by enhancing degraded habitat with artificial shelter. Thus, we suggest that incorporating artificial shelter into the dual-pronged approach of simultaneous urchin and coral restoration may facilitate the recovery of Florida’s reefs.

AB  - The deleterious effects (biodeterioration) and the protective benefits (bioprotection) of biological colonisation on manmade structures have long been debated. Lichens, biofilms, algae, bivalves and gastropods contribute both directly and indirectly to damaging substrata in the coastal zone which can enhance abiotic erosive forces that exploit biologically induced superficial damage. There is mounting evidence that these same species may also provide protective benefits. This debate often impacts approaches to managing fouling on concrete assets in the coastal environment. The net benefit or detriment a species or assemblage has on a structure is spatially and temporally dynamic and subject to the influence of various abiotic and biotic factors at different scales. However, the net outcome may be more pronounced under different contexts, particularly under warming and ocean acidifying climate change scenarios which is where further research should focus. Additionally, as bioprotection represents a potentially valuable ecosystem service, it supports the argument for increasing and improving habitat availability and biodiversity on artificial coastal structures via ecological enhancement. Quantifying bioprotection in useful metrics, such as monetary value or time added to serviceable life, would help demonstrate the benefits of bioprotective species in a meaningful way. Outline: • Intertidal organisms are capable of both biodeteriorative and bioprotective effects. • Most studies fail to determine overall net impact of biological colonisation. • Calcifying organisms, such as barnacles, are likely to provide best bioprotection.

AB  - The Coral Triangle encompasses nearly 30% of the world's coral reefs and is widely considered the epicenter of marine biodiversity. Destructive fishing practices and natural disturbances common to this region damage reefs leaving behind fields of coral rubble. While the impacts of disturbances in these ecosystems are well documented on metazoans, we have a poor understanding of their impact on microbial communities at the base of the food web. We use metabarcoding to characterize protist community composition in sites of varying fisheries management schemes and benthic profiles across the island of Lombok, Indonesia. Our study shows that rubble coverage and net primary productivity are the strongest explainers of variation in protist communities across Lombok. More specifically, rubble fields are characterized by increases in small heterotrophic protists, including ciliates and cercozoans. In addition to shifts in heterotrophic protist communities, we also observed increases in diatom relative abundance in rubble fields, which corresponded to sites with higher net primary productivity. These results are the first to characterize protist communities in tropical marine rubble fields and provide insight on environmental factors potentially driving these shifts on a local scale.

AB  - The complex web of interactions between ecological communities and the physical landscape (biogeomorphology) is being affected by the global scale environmental changes of the Anthropocene. Climate change, habitat destruction, invasions and extinctions are having profound impacts on biogeomorphological process regimes through changes in the composition and activity of ecological communities. However, on the other hand, deliberately-targeted human interventions to biogeomorphic systems have the potential to help mitigate against, and adapt to, the Anthropocene, by managing biogeomorphic processes to enhance resilience. To evaluate these relationships, we propose a conceptual framework based on the ecological concept of functional traits. We review how the Anthropocene is causing changes in species composition, abundance and the prevalence of functional traits to produce changes to biogeomorphic processes and functions that are, as yet, only partly understood. We use examples of fluvial, dryland and coastal biogeomorphic systems to illustrate how purposeful manipulation of biogeomorphic systems (as a type of Nature-based solution) can conserve, enhance or add biogeomorphic functions that are capable of enhancing geomorphic resilience. By focussing on function, this approach offers a range of advantages/avenues for biogeomorphological research. This includes the detection and prediction of human impacts, and an improved understanding of how biogeomorphology can contribute to tackling environmental challenges in the Anthropocene. • Biogeomorphic systems have been hugely affected by human activities over many centuries • Manipulating biogeomorphic systems through Nature-based Solutions can enhance geomorphic resilience and ecosystem services • We propose a biological trait-based conceptual framework for biogeomorphology in the Anthropocene.

AB  - The coastlines of many Arabian cities are now dominated by structures such as seawalls, breakwaters and jetties as urbanization has expanded rapidly in the region. Coastal development has substantially degraded the mangrove forests, saltmarshes, seagrass meadows, oyster beds and coral reefs that traditionally provided invaluable ecosystem goods and services to coastal trading villages of the Arabian Gulf. Regional awareness of environmental issues is growing, however, and local governments are increasingly promoting more sustainable urban development. The use of ecological engineering approaches, along with improved environmental policies, may mitigate some past impacts, and will potentially create new development projects with greater ecological benefits for more sustainable growth in the future. In this paper, we discuss past coastal development in the Gulf, and offer advice on how ecological engineering could be used to enhance the ecological benefits of coastal infrastructure, particularly by encouraging the colonization of juvenile corals and fishes. Such approaches can encourage more sustainable development of this increasingly urbanized seascape.

AB  - The Chandeleur islands have been eroding and migrating over the St. Bernard delta since the Mississippi River avulsed and changed course. In contrast to their erosion, the island terminus has been growing through longshore transport processes forming spits. An unusually large volume of sand located at the northern terminus of the barrier cannot be accounted for by annual longshore transport budgets estimated by previous studies. This paper demonstrates quantitatively, and through the use of physics-based hydrodynamic models and accepted sediment transport relationships, that event-driven transport resulting from storms of higher energy compared to cold fronts, can produce transport that is larger by two orders of magnitude in comparison. These results suggest that the sediment dynamics and resulting evolution of this segment of the barrier island might be dominated by larger storms rather than cold fronts or fair weather conditions.

AB  - The challenge of estuarine management is to maintain existing estuarine natural structure and functioning, to rectify historical damage and negative impacts of human actions which produced socio-economic problems, and at the same time to guarantee present and future economic development. Applying a multidisciplinary and functional, holistic approach is essential to maintain a healthy natural system. Scientists and managers are searching for measures to adapt the ecosystem in such a way that flood risk is decreased, harbour activities can further develop and nature is conserved. This literature review (including 286 publications) gives an overview of a broad range of management measures that are, or can be, applied for estuarine management, including measures to change hydrology, morphology, habitat, and water and sediment quality. Furthermore, the differences between the different management measures regarding its impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity are identified to detect which management measures can contribute to specific estuarine targets. By looking for trade-offs and synergies, opportunities to reduce management costs and increase benefits to society are revealed. This can help to develop an integrated management strategy among the many management departments and with respect to both ecological and socio-economic needs.

AB  - The Caribbean is affected by climate change due to an increase in the variability, frequency, and intensity of extreme weather events. When coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations, project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models, indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions. However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind, cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation.

AB  - The aim of this research was to establish whether the shell of green-lipped mussels and Pacific oysters could be plasma sprayed to promote and accelerate the establishment of filter feeder colonies. While CaCO3 degrades before melting under equilibrium conditions, the hypothesis considered in this work was that the high-temperature, highly nonequilibrium conditions experienced by powders during plasma spraying may be sufficient to impart enough thermal energy into the powder, at a fast enough rate, that the CaCO3 phase would melt before undergoing total thermal degradation. Sprayable mussel and oyster shell powder was manufactured by crushing and milling. A range of plasma spray parameters incorporating a wide operating window of plasma power and gas velocity were trialed. Coatings were initially formed from both powders under all plasma spray conditions used. However, the samples degraded into powdery debris with time due to the reaction of CaO with water in the air to form Ca(OH)2. No evidence of CaCO3 melting was found, indicating that it was not possible to form a coating by thermal spraying. The mechanism of inflight particle phase degradation is presented for both powders, along with proposed mechanism of initial coating formation due to melting of CaO.

AB  - The accelerating marks of climate change on coral-reef ecosystems, combined with the recognition that traditional management measures are not efficient enough to cope with climate change tempo and human footprints, have raised a need for new approaches to reef restoration. The most widely used approach is the “coral gardening” tenet; an active reef restoration tactic based on principles, concepts, and theories used in silviculture. During the relatively short period since its inception, the gardening approach has been tested globally in a wide range of reef sites, and on about 100 coral species, utilizing hundreds of thousands of nursery-raised coral colonies. While still lacking credibility for simulating restoration scenarios under forecasted climate change impacts, and with a limited adaptation toolkit used in the gardening approach, it is still deficient. Therefore, novel restoration avenues have recently been suggested and devised, and some have already been tested, primarily in the laboratory. Here, I describe seven classes of such novel avenues and tools, which include the improved gardening methodologies, ecological engineering approaches, assisted migration/colonization, assisted genetics/evolution, assisted microbiome, coral epigenetics, and coral chimerism. These are further classified into three operation levels, each dependent on the success of the former level. Altogether, the seven approaches and the three operation levels represent a unified active reef restoration toolbox, under the umbrella of the gardening tenet, focusing on the enhancement of coral resilience and adaptation in a changing world.

AB  - The abundant riparian wetlands supported by the complex river network in Pearl River Delta (PRD) are under an intensely anthropogenic disturbance that threatens the local ecological environment. This paper examined the benthic invertebrate diversity and biomass within the Pearl River through a field study. A fieldwork was conducted to assess a hydrological connectivity gradient among the main channel of the Pearl River. The responses of macroinvertebrate metrics to the connectivity gradient and the restoration history in the river channel were examined. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.75 to 2.08, which was the highest among most connectivity river channels. Statistical analyses (PCA and CCA) revealed that the benthic abundance in high hydrological connectivity riverine habitats is clearly distinct from the low connectivity habitats. Results demonstrated that the diversity and density of macrobenthos are determined by hydrological connectivity and time span of the restoration (river channels). Therefore, conservation and restoration efforts should focus on the macroinvertebrate response to the hydrological connectivity of the river channels in PRD.

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Waves have profound effects on coastal geomorphology, but the understanding of wave climate effects on coastal ecology is limited due, in part, to the high cost of commercial wave gauges. High-cost gauges also limit the scope of coastal wave models and the ability of coastal land managers to design effective restoration, conservation and enhancement projects. To address these limitations, a low-cost do-it-yourself (DIY) wave gauge was constructed using commercial plumbing parts, a pressure sensor, an Arduino© microcontroller and adapted accessories. Details on gauge construction, coding and an instructional video tutorial are provided. Performance of the DIY gauge was determined by measuring the agreement of raw pressure data recorded by the DIY gauge to a comparable commercial gauge in both a laboratory wave channel study featuring a series of wave tests and in a complementary field test. Agreement of raw pressure data among gauges in the wave channel study was assessed using paired t-tests and by fitting linear models. Field test data agreement was assessed by comparing the total wave field energy recorded by each gauge and by fitting a linear model to recorded raw pressure data. Pressure data agreement between the gauges was excellent in all wave channel tests with mean differences between pressure readings consistently near zero and with 95% of all differences lying within ±63 Pascals (<1 cm static water depth), on average. The greatest variability between readings occurred within tests featuring high-frequency waves, mirroring results reported by others. Still, raw DIY wave gauge data explained, on average, 91% of the variance in raw commercial gauge data in wave channel tests. Field performance testing indicated similar gauge responses with 92% total wave energy agreement. Thus, the DIY wave gauge is a viable alternative to high-cost gauges that could improve the understanding and management of coastal environments.

AB  - Temperature and salinity and their interaction exert a major control on the life cycle of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), affecting reproduction, development, growth, and mortality. Quantifying specific temperature and salinity relationships on oyster growth and mortality has, however, proven difficult, with data suggesting potentially region-specific responses. Legacy and recent data from field tray studies from public oyster grounds in Barataria Bay (BA) and Breton Sound (BS) were used to estimate growth and mortality rates as a function of temperature and salinity. Previous studies conducted in BA and BS reported differences in growth and mortality between the basins. In the present study, environmental conditions were synchronized to compare growth and mortality between basins at similar combinations of temperature and salinity. Results indicate that when temperature and salinity are the same (synchronized), seasonal oyster growth and mortality rates still differ between BA and BS. Given the same salinity and temperature conditions, differences in growth and mortality rates between estuaries may persist because of differences in other environmental conditions (i.e., food quality and composition, hydrology, site history, and salinity variation) or localized genetic adaptations to environmental conditions.

AB  - Suspended sediment concentration (c) has been considered a critical environmental factor in reef habitats; however, the values and variations of c are not evident in a unique reef mainly created by crustose coralline algal concretions compared to abundant studies in coral reefs. The results of real-time and long-term monitoring of waves and c over the intertidal algal reef are reported because of the construction of an offshore industrial harbor near the reef. The real-time monitoring systems were based on techniques, including optical backscatter sensors (OBSs) for measuring c, pressure sensors for measuring waves, data loggers, and wireless networks for data transmission. The instruments sampled every hour and ran continuously and automatically for years. The OBS measurement was compared and validated with biweekly water sampling. A good correlation between the results of the two methods was observed. Nevertheless, more calibrations of OBSs in different seasons reduced the variance between the two methods over a year-long timescale. The year-long data showed a remarkable seasonal variation in c. The average c was approximately 140 mg/l during the winter season, while it was only approximately 70 mg/l during the summer season. The observed c was higher than that in other coral reef environments; the elevated and highly variable c, ranging from approximately 0 to 500 mg/l, may be one factor that creates the unique algae reef environment. The year-long measurement of waves and c showed that the variation in c was mainly due to the variation in waves in different seasons and was well correlated with the wave-induced bed shear stress. The real-time and long-term data measured by the system will aid in better understanding and providing useful environmental data for accessing future environmental changes and protecting reef habitats.

AB  - Summary Nearshore ecosystems are increasingly recognized as critical habitats for fish of cultural, ecological and economic significance. These ecosystems are often densely inhabited by juvenile fish, highly productive and refuges from predation, leading ecologists to characterize them as nurseries. However, nearshore ecosystems are being transformed globally to support demands of growing coastal populations. Many shorelines are modified by armouring (e.g. seawalls, riprap) that minimizes erosion, and overwater structures (e.g. piers, docks) that facilitate waterfront use. These modifications affect the ecology of nearshore systems by restructuring, eliminating and shading shallow waters. Here, we review literature examining effects of armouring and overwater structures on coastal and estuarine fishes, and discuss how research and management can coordinate to minimize negative effects. Along armoured shorelines, fish assemblages differed from unarmoured sites, fish consumed less epibenthic and terrestrial prey, beach spawning was less successful and fish were larger. Under large overwater structures, visually oriented fish were less abundant and they fed less. Shade from overwater structures also interrupted localized movements of migratory fish. Thus, shoreline modifications impaired habitats by limiting feeding, reproduction, ontogenetic habitat shifts from shallow to deeper waters and connectivity. Research suggests that restoring shallow waters and substrate complexity, and minimizing shading underneath overwater structures, can rehabilitate habitats compromised by shoreline modifications. Synthesis and applications. Shoreline armouring and overwater structures often compromise fish habitats. These threats to nearshore fish habitats will become more severe as growing coastal populations and rising sea levels increase demands for shoreline infrastructure. Our ability to assess and rehabilitate nearshore fish habitats along modified shorelines will be enhanced by: focusing research attention on metrics that directly indicate fish habitat quality; implementing and evaluating shoreline features that repair compromised habitat functions within human-use constraints; collating natural history knowledge of nearshore ecosystems; and embracing the socio-ecological nature of habitat improvements by educating the public about conservation efforts and fostering appreciation of local nearshore ecosystems. Actions to reduce impacts of shoreline modifications on fish are particularly feasible when they align with societal goals, such as improving flood protection and providing spaces that facilitate recreation, education, and connections between people and nature.

AB  - Summary Current efforts to restore and create ecosystems require greater understanding of ecosystems’ responses to commonly used physical and biological intervention approaches to overcome ecological and technological limitations. We estimated effect sizes from measurements of biotic assemblage structure and biogeochemical functions at 628 restored and created wetlands globally, in comparison with 499 reference wetlands. We studied the recovery trajectories of wetlands where different restoration or creation approaches were used under different environmental settings. Although the variance explained by a linear mixed-effects models was low (6–7%), the study of recovery trajectories showed that the restoration or creation approach had no significant effects in most environmental settings. In particular, wetlands where surface modification and flow re-establishment were used followed similar recovery trajectories regardless of whether they were revegetated or not. We even found potential detrimental effects of biological manipulations on the recovery of the plant assemblage, particularly in cold climates and in wetlands restored or created in agricultural areas. Since physical interventions are required to recover or create the hydrological conditions of degraded or new wetlands, and given the high cost (22–73%) of biological interventions (i.e. revegetation), the need for biological interventions is, in most cases, unclear. Our results highlight the urgent need to increase our understanding of the long-term effects of restoration and creation actions in our aim to engage in large-scale ecosystem management strategies for wetlands. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that, currently, the recovery and development processes of restored and created wetlands can be driven by spontaneous processes rather than by the response of wetlands to human interventions other than those targeted to restore hydrological conditions that existed prior to disturbance. However, given the synthetic nature of the data set, the mixed nature of available data and the limited number of measures we found to estimate recovery, caution must be exercised when adapting the results presented here to the planning and execution of specific ecosystem restoration projects.

AB  - Summary 1.Quantifying the response of mobile consumers to changes in habitat availability is essential for determining the degree to which population-level productivity is habitat limited rather than regulated by other, potentially density-independent factors. 2.Over landscape scales, this can be explored by monitoring changes in density and foraging as habitat availability varies. As habitat availability increases, densities may: (1) decrease (unit-area production decreases; weak habitat limitation); (2) remain stable (unit-area production remains stable; habitat limitation); or (3) increase (unit-area production increases; strong habitat limitation). 3.We tested the response of mobile estuarine consumers over five months to changes in habitat availability in situ by comparing densities and feeding rates on artificial reefs that were or were not adjacent to neighboring artificial reefs or nearby natural reefs). 4.Using either constructed or natural reefs to manipulate habitat availability, we documented three-fold density decreases among juvenile stone crabs as habitat increased (i.e. weak habitat imitation). However, for adult stone crabs, density remained stable across treatments, demonstrating that habitat limitation presents a bottleneck in this species’ later life history. Oyster toadfish densities also did not change with increasing habitat availability (i.e. habitat limitation), but densities of other cryptic fishes decreased as habitat availability increased (i.e. weak limitation). Feeding and abundance data suggested that some mobile fishes experience habitat limitation, or, potentially in one case, strong limitation across our habitat manipulations. 5.These findings of significant, community-level habitat limitation provide insight into how global declines in structurally complex estuarine habitats may have reduced the fishery production of coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Successful invasive species compete for the same available resources with related native species, frequently driving the latter to the cusp of extirpation because of a lack of adaptive response. In this paper we analysed the behavioural relationships between two species of crayfish, the native Astacus leptodactylus and the invasive Orconectes limosus in an ongoing invasion process in the Lower Danube, in Eastern Europe. We tested the species’ ability to acquire shelter and food in laboratory experiments in both intra- and interspecific confrontations. The dominant behaviour of the invasive species is obvious even towards its own congeners, while the native species display a more tolerant conspecific behaviour. With respect to interspecific confrontation, the invasive crayfish males and females were inclined to sex-specific dominance regarding shelters. A roughly balanced behaviour was noted for intersexual confrontations. The results of this study also highlight that the occupancy of a shelter is more disputed than food resources, which appear to be opportunistically acquired. In the context of the current invasion process, we hypothesised that the effect caused by interference competition might lead to a decline of the native species. Further investigations may reveal if there is any hope for recovery of the native species.

AB  - Structure-building, autogenic ecosystem engineers are recognized worldwide as potential tools for coastal protection, which depends on long-term sustainability and persistence of their structures. For reef-building oysters, reefs are maintained through accumulation of shell material, which depends on recruitment and growth and which provides substrate for new generations. Knowledge of the fundamental niche of oysters in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions helps define the area where ecosystem engineers grow and survive well and where their structures are likely to persist and be effective for coastal protection. Response curves of different lifehistory stages (larvae, juveniles and adults) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated along a tidal emersion gradient in a manipulative field study. Density of juvenile oysters was maximal around 36% tidal emersion. Shell growth of juveniles and adults, condition index (CI) of adults and mortality of adults were negatively related to tidal emersion, whereas mortality of juveniles was positively related to tidal emersion. Tidal emersion had a strong effect on oyster survival and growth, with the most favourable being around 20 to 40% tidal emersion, as indicated by recruit density and the CI of adults. These findings suggest that the area of 20 to 40% tidal emersion is optimal for reef development, which is in line with other investigations of C. gigas and the eastern oyster C. virginica across different systems, supporting a broader geographical application of these findings.

AB  - Storm surges from tropical and extratropical storms frequently impact coastal communities globally. While the potential of natural and nature-based features for coastal defenses has gained increased attention as a viable option for coastal flood protection, the lack of in situ measurements of storm surge attenuation has delayed their widespread utilization. We present the findings of a 3-yr water level monitoring campaign that resulted in a large collection (52 flood events) of attenuation rates from marsh transects located in two natural preserves in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region. Results show that the overall marsh attenuated water levels, exhibiting values up to 0.02 cm/m at Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge (ES) and 0.03 cm/m at Magothy Bay Natural Preserve (MGB). In general, the greatest attenuation rates were observed at the marsh edge section. The reach close to the coastline revealed an amplification of the water level followed by water level attenuation toward the backside of the marsh. However, analyses of five major storms at ES demonstrated that, within each event, the ability of the upper marsh to attenuate water level decreased with higher inundation heights. Additionally, small spatial scales of the marsh platform, geomorphological features such as channels, elevated surrounding forests and levees seem to play a major role in reducing the attenuation rates provided by the marshes. These results indicate that, while this type of marshland would provide storm surge attenuation during low inundation heights, these ecosystems would be less effective attenuating higher water depths from extreme events.

AB  - Storm surge and sea level rise (SLR) are affecting coastal communities, properties, and ecosystems. While coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands and marshes, have the capacity to reduce the impacts of storm surge and coastal flooding, the increasing rate of SLR can induce the transformation and migration of these natural habitats. In this study, we combined coastal storm surge modeling and economic analysis to evaluate the role of natural habitats in coastal flood protection. We focused on a selected cross-section of three coastal counties in New Jersey adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR) that is protected by wetlands and marshes. The coupled coastal hydrodynamic and wave models, ADCIRC+SWAN, were applied to simulate flooding from historical and synthetic storms in the Mid-Atlantic US for current and future SLR scenarios. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was used to project the potential migration and habitat transformation in coastal marshes due to SLR in the year 2050. Furthermore, a counterfactual land cover approach, in which marshes are converted to open water in the model, was implemented for each storm scenario in the present and the future to estimate the amount of flooding that is avoided due to the presence of natural habitats and the subsequent reduction in residential property damage. The results indicate that this salt marshes can reduce up to 14% of both the flood depth and property damage during relatively low intensity storm events, demonstrating the efficacy of natural flood protection for recurrent storm events. Monetarily, this translates to the avoidance of up to $13.1 and $32.1 million in residential property damage in the selected coastal counties during the ‘50-year storm’ simulation and hurricane Sandy under current sea level conditions, and in the year ‘2050 SLR scenario’, respectively. This research suggests that protecting and preserving natural habitats can contribute to enhance coastal resilience.

AB  - Spatially complex habitats provide refuge for prey and mediate many predator-prey interactions. Increasing anthropogenic pressures are eroding such habitats, reducing their complexity and potentially altering ecosystem stability on a global scale. Yet, we have only a rudimentary understanding of how structurally complex habitats create ecological refuges for most ecosystems. Better informed management decisions require an understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the provision of physical refuge and this may be linked to prey size, predator size and predator identity in priority habitats. We tested each of these factors empirically in a model biogenic reef system. Specifically, we tested whether mortality rates of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) of different sizes differed among: (i) different forms of reef structural distribution (represented as 'clumped', 'patchy' and 'sparse'); (ii) predator species identity (shore crab, Carcinus maenas and starfish, Asterias rubens); and (iii) predator size. The survival rate of small mussels was greatest in the clumped experimental habitat and larger predators generally consumed more prey regardless of the structural organisation of treatment. Small mussels were protected from larger A. rubens but not from larger C. maenas in the clumped habitats. The distribution pattern of structural objects, therefore, may be considered a useful proxy for reef complexity when assessing predator-prey interactions, and optimal organisations should be considered based on both prey and predator sizes. These findings are essential to understand ecological processes underpinning predation rates in structurally complex habitats and to inform future restoration and ecological engineering practices.

AB  - Southern California beaches are often sandy, but with largely undocumented cobble patches and berms. We describe the first multi-year, spatially extensive observations of surface cobbles at southern California beaches. The variation (spatial and temporal) of surface cobble distribution and backshore (e.g. upper foreshore) cobble morphology (slope, vertical extent, and elevation) are characterized using 11 years (2008–2018) of observations spanning 4.8 km of shoreline at Cardiff and Torrey Pines State beaches. Quarterly Global Positioning System surveys of beach elevation and visually identified sediment type (either sand or cobble) are used to create 1076 cross-shore profiles. Cobbles were not exposed continuously at either of these predominantly sandy beaches. The 202 cross-shore profiles with backshore cobbles and sandy foreshores are used for morphology analysis. Consistent with previous studies, cobble and sandy morphologies varied seasonally, and cobbles were most exposed during winter when wave energy increased. Extensive (vertical extent ≥ 2 m) backshore cobbles were usually fronted by low elevation, low slope sandy foreshores. At Torrey Pines cobble patches were occasionally exposed mid-profile on primarily sandy summer beaches. Persistent (2008–2015) backshore cobbles at Cardiff were apparently buried in 2016 by effects of a 2012 sand nourishment. Formation of year-round cobble piles on these seasonally sandy beaches may result from chronically reduced sand input owing to anthropogenic controls on river flooding and coastal cliff erosion (e.g. dams and seawalls).

AB  - Small-scale armoring placed near the marsh-upland interface to protect single-family homes is widespread but understudied. Using a nested, spatially blocked sampling design on the coast of Georgia, USA, we compared the biota and environmental characteristics of 60 marshes adjacent to either a bulkhead, a residential backyard with no armoring, or an intact forest. We found that marshes adjacent to bulkheads were at lower tidal elevations and had features typical of lower elevation marsh habitats: high coverage of the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora, high density of crab burrows, and muddy sediments. Marshes adjacent to unarmored residential sites had higher soil water content and lower porewater salinities than the armored or forested sites, suggesting that there may be increased freshwater input to the marsh at these sites. Deposition of Spartina wrack on the marsh-upland ecotone was negatively related to elevation at armored sites and positively related at unarmored residential and forested sites. Armored and unarmored residential sites had reduced densities of the high marsh crab Armases cinereum, a species that moves readily across the ecotone at forested sites, using both upland and high marsh habitats. Distance from the upland to the nearest creek was longest at forested sites. The effects observed here were subtle, perhaps because of the small-scale, scattered nature of development. Continued installation of bulkheads in the southeast could lead to greater impacts such as those reported in more densely armored areas like the northeastern USA. Moreover, bulkheads provide a barrier to inland marsh migration in the face of sea level rise. Retaining some forest vegetation at the marsh-upland interface and discouraging armoring except in cases of demonstrated need could minimize these impacts.

AB  - Shorelines at the interface of marine, estuarine and terrestrial biomes are among the most degraded and threatened habitats in the coastal zone because of their sensitivity to sea level rise, storms and increased human utilization. Previous efforts to protect shorelines have largely involved constructing bulkheads and seawalls which can detrimentally affect nearshore habitats. Recently, efforts have shifted towards “living shoreline” approaches that include biogenic breakwater reefs. Our study experimentally tested the efficacy of breakwater reefs constructed of oyster shell for protecting eroding coastal shorelines and their effect on nearshore fish and shellfish communities. Along two different stretches of eroding shoreline, we created replicated pairs of subtidal breakwater reefs and established unaltered reference areas as controls. At both sites we measured shoreline and bathymetric change and quantified oyster recruitment, fish and mobile macro-invertebrate abundances. Breakwater reef treatments mitigated shoreline retreat by more than 40% at one site, but overall vegetation retreat and erosion rates were high across all treatments and at both sites. Oyster settlement and subsequent survival were observed at both sites, with mean adult densities reaching more than eighty oysters m−2 at one site. We found the corridor between intertidal marsh and oyster reef breakwaters supported higher abundances and different communities of fishes than control plots without oyster reef habitat. Among the fishes and mobile invertebrates that appeared to be strongly enhanced were several economically-important species. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were the most clearly enhanced (+297%) by the presence of breakwater reefs, while red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (+108%), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) (+88%) and flounder (Paralichthys sp.) (+79%) also benefited. Although the vertical relief of the breakwater reefs was reduced over the course of our study and this compromised the shoreline protection capacity, the observed habitat value demonstrates ecological justification for future, more robust shoreline protection projects.

AB  - Shorelines around many estuaries and coastal embayments are rapidly eroding (approximately several meters/year), with more rapid erosion rates expected in the future due to natural and anthropogenic stressors. In response, a variety of techniques have been used to stabilize shorelines, but there are limited quantitative, long-term data available about their effects on the sedimentary environment immediately adjacent to them (i.e., the nearshore). This study evaluated changes in sediment characteristics (mud and organic content) and accumulation rates associated with installation of breakwaters, riprap, and living shorelines with (“hybrid”) and without (“soft”) a structural component. 210Pb (half-life 22.3 years) geochronologies were used to identify horizons in core profiles that corresponded to years when structures were built. Sites with naturally eroding shorelines (i.e., no structures) were used as a control group at which any sedimentary changes represent broad environmental trends, in contrast to changes at the protected sites that also include the influence of structures. Observations were placed within the context of modeled wave climate, shoreline-erosion rates, land use, dominant sediment source, and the apparent effect on submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) inhabiting the nearshore sedimentary environment. The main conclusion of this study is that there was no “one size fits all” answer to anticipated impacts of structures on nearshore sedimentary environments. Instead, specific changes associated with structures depended on individual site characteristics, but could be predicted with multiple linear regression models that included structure type, shoreline-erosion rate, dominant sediment source, and land use. Riprap or breakwater installation had either positive or no obvious impact on SAV at six of seven sites but negatively impacted SAV at one riprapped site. No obvious impacts on SAV were observed at living shoreline sites.

AB  - Shorelines and their ecosystems are endangered by sea-level rise. Nature-based coastal protection is becoming a global strategy to enhance coastal resilience through the cost-effective creation, restoration and sustainable use of coastal wetlands. However, the resilience to sea-level rise of coastal wetlands created under Nature-based Solution has been assessed largely on a regional scale. Here we assess, using a meta-analysis, the difference in accretion, elevation, and sediment deposition rates between natural and restored coastal wetlands across the world. Our results show that restored coastal wetlands can trap more sediment and that the effectiveness of these restoration projects is primarily driven by sediment availability, not by wetland elevation, tidal range, local rates of sea-level rise, and significant wave height. Our results suggest that Nature-based Solutions can mitigate coastal wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise, but are effective only in coastal locations where abundant sediment supply is available. Coastal wetlands restored by Nature-based Solutions can trap more sediments than natural ones, and their efficiency is mainly determined by sediment supply, according to a meta-analysis of studies globally.

AB  - Shoreline position has been forwarding or retrograding due to many factors, among them climate change and human interferences play a major role. The shoreline changes can be analyzed by various methods. In the present study, Linear Regression Rate (LRR) method is applied for the demarcation of rate of shoreline changes along the coast of Thiruchendur Taluk, Thoothukudi district, by using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). It is an extension tool in ArcGIS. The length of the coast is 45 km. The coastal zone is further divided into three coastal zones based on their administrative division (panchayat union). The zones are Alwarthirunagiri coast, Thiruchendur coast, and Udankudi coast. These zone divisions are done for detailed mapping. Multi-date of remotely sensed data was used for mapping the details. These data are georeferenced with the UTM projection of WGS1984 and digitized the shorelines with the FCC color image. Transect lines were generated using DSAS tool. The transect lines starting from 752 to 1210 were used for present study to assess the shoreline changes. The tool had generated the LRR Statistic reports on each transect lines for all shorelines. The statistic report has been classified into five classes, viz., high erosion, low erosion, stable, low accretion, and high accretion. Finally, the shoreline has classified with LRR reports. The overall result shows that, low accretion has notied at 36 km (79%), high accretion perceived at 8.7 km (8.7%), and stable has observed in 8.3 km (8.3%), along the coast. Whereas, low erosion was noticed around 1.4 km (3.1%), and no high erosion was noticed along the study area. Thiruchendur and Udankudi coastal zones are mostly perceived low rate of shoreline changes with the rate from 1.02 to 3.96 m/year, happen in 18.9 km and 16.5 km, respectively. But, Alwarthirunagiri coast zone, low rate of erosion is noticed along the 1.4-km length of the shore. The study has concluded that, most of the Thiruchendur Taluk coastal areas are under the low-rate accretion, and the same area is observed as erosion along the coast due to both natural and human activities. Thiruchendur Taluk has major coastal cities, and a large number of people live around the coast. There are numerous natural resources and tourist places around the coast. Therefore, this coastal area shoreline changes studies should be examined.

AB  - Shoreline erosion in lakes is a pressing issue for many landowners, yet common erosion mitigation practices that involve armoring can alter littoral habitat and potentially diminish near-shore biodiversity. We studied the effects of two armoring methods (i.e., riprap, retaining walls) on habitat, taxonomic richness, relative abundance, and total abundance of fishes and benthic macroinvertebrates at shorelines on Big Rideau Lake in eastern Ontario, Canada. Snorkel surveys were conducted to assess aquatic habitat characteristics and fish diversity, and benthic infauna were sampled using kick-nets. Submergent and emergent macrophytes were more abundant at natural rocky shorelines compared to shorelines modified with riprap or retaining walls. Coarse woody debris was also more abundant at natural shorelines compared to riprap and retaining wall shorelines. Relative abundances of some fish species varied between shoreline types, but overall species richness and total abundance did not. Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) were more abundant at natural sites than armored sites. Conversely, Rock Bass (Ambloplites rupestris), Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens), and baitfish from the family Cyprinidae were more abundant at both types of armored sites compared to natural sites. Taxonomic richness of benthic macroinvertebrates did not vary among shoreline types, however abundance of Amphipoda, Isopoda, Ephemeroptera, and Cladocera was greater at armored shorelines. These results suggest that human modification of shorelines is altering littoral ecosystems and potentially leading to shifts in the community structure of littoral nekton. More study is needed to fully understand the community level effects of shoreline erosion mitigation involving armoring in freshwater lakes and determine the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies that preserve natural habitat features.

AB  - Shoreline armoring is prevalent around the world with unprecedented human population growth and urbanization along coastal habitats. Armoring structures, such as riprap and bulkheads, that are built to prevent beach erosion and protect coastal infrastructure from storms and flooding can cause deterioration of habitats for migratory fish species, disrupt aquatic-terrestrial connectivity, and reduce overall coastal ecosystem health. Relative to armored shorelines, natural shorelines retain valuable habitats for macroinvertebrates and other coastal biota. One question is whether the impacts of armoring are reversible, allowing restoration via armoring removal and related actions of sediment nourishment and replanting of native riparian vegetation. Armoring removal is targeted as a viable option for restoring some habitat functions, but few assessments of coastal biota response exist. Here, we use opportunistic sampling of pre- and post-restoration data for five biotic measures (wrack % cover, saltmarsh % cover, number of logs, and macroinvertebrate abundance and richness) from a set of six restored sites in Puget Sound, WA, USA. This broad suite of ecosystem metrics responded strongly and positively to armor removal, and these results were evident after less than one year. Restoration responses remained positive and statistically significant across different shoreline elevations and temporal trajectories. This analysis shows that removing shoreline armoring is effective for restoration projects aimed at improving the health and productivity of coastal ecosystems, and these results may be widely applicable.

AB  - Shoreline armoring can impact a variety of ecosystem functions, goods and services provided by beaches. Shoreline managers struggle to balance genuine need for armoring to protect infrastructure versus unacceptable losses of ecosystem functions––whether these be in beaches, sand dunes, or marshes. We use our recent research effort in the Salish Sea, Washington, as a case study to illustrate how highlighting the negative consequences of shoreline armoring to publicly important ecosystem functions may help to strengthen implementation of policy and prioritize restoration actions. We focus on two distinct mechanisms of armoring impact that link strongly to key beach functions, and recommend: (1) where armoring is clearly necessary, place or move it as high on the beach as possible. Armoring emplaced relatively low on the shore is more likely to affect a variety of ecosystem functions from forage fish spawning to beach recreation; (2) prioritize protection or restoration (armor removal) of feeder bluffs that are critical for sediment supply to the beach; this sediment is essential to the maintenance of beach functions. In addition, we recommend that nature-based alternatives to armoring be given preferential regulatory consideration and that outreach efforts clarify the advantages of these engineering methods.

AB  - Shellfish farming is considered a highly sustainable form of aquaculture that has developed rapidly worldwide. Unfortunately, today biological and chemical pollution of the oceans and marine waters is widespread and has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, which are exacerbated by global climate changes. In addition, such impacts on fisheries and aquaculture are significant in inducing socio-economic losses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop innovative solutions to improve productivity and environmental performance in line with the blue sustainable economy (European Green Deal). However, one upcoming problem associated with shellfish consumption is shell waste and its disposal. In addition, the percentage of wasted shells destined for reuse is much lower than the one accumulated in landfills or in more or less well-managed sites. This represents a weakness of the shellfish farming sector that can only be mitigated through a project of shellfish waste recycling moving towards the circular economy, with undoubted environmental and economic advantages. In the present study, we present a possible solution for recycling clam shells coming from the waste of the fishing industry (circular economy). Indeed, three eco-friendly bio-reefs for the stabilization and implementation of marine biodiversity (blue economy) were realized using additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) for large dimensions (technological innovation). Furthermore, before deploying the reefs on the sea bottom, they were colonized with oysters to promote repopulation.

AB  - Several barriers still hamper the effective implementation of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). Among the others, this work focuses on collaboration barriers. NBS implementation claims for effective collaboration among different decision-agents. However, ambiguity in problem framings, which is ineradicable in multi-agents’ decision environments, could create collaboration barriers. This work aims to demonstrate that collaboration barriers to NBS implementation can be overcome by enhancing the network of interactions among the decision-agents. An innovative method based on the integration between Social Network Analysis and hybrid Agent-Based Model/System Dynamic Model was adopted to this aim. The analysis results were used for designing networking interventions, i.e. efforts using social network characteristics that could enhance interactions mechanisms among decision-agents. The developed method was implemented in the Medina del Campo (Spain) case study. This area is characterised by one of the most critical groundwater bodies of the Duero River Basin. This work aims at supporting the implementation of suitable NBS to stop the degradation of the groundwater status and associated ecosystem services. The activities carried out within the framework of the NAIAD project showed that, by enhancing the interaction mechanisms, ambiguity in problem frames can still yield collective actions for NBS implementation.

AB  - Serranilla is a protected island of the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, far from dense human population. These characteristics could help sustain structurally complex coral reefs, often associated with higher biodiversity, abundance, and biomass of reef-associated organisms, including reef fish. However, the multiple threats present in Serranilla, including intense illegal fishing, can impact coral ecosystems generally and also specific key groups, such as the parrotfish, in particular. During the “Seaflower Research Expedition 2017”, we assessed how structural habitat complexity influences reef fish assemblages. In addition, we explored differences in parrotfish species (family: Scaridae) between Serranilla and San Andres, the most populated island in the Archipelago. On Serranilla, we found that habitat structure, rugosity, and coral cover accounted for up to 66% of variation in reef fish diversity, abundance, and biomass, with values being higher on more complex reefs. Parrotfish species differed between the islands, with larger species supporting higher biomasses at Serranilla, by comparison with San Andres; however, the abundance, biomass, and lengths of parrotfish species were low in both areas compared with those reported from other protected Caribbean reefs. Our study indicates that despite the evident relationship between structurally complex habitats and reef fish, other threats in Serranilla could be affecting parrotfish populations, such as illegal fishing, a widespread activity in the area.

AB  - Self-facilitation through ecosystem engineering (i.e., organism modification of the abiotic environment) and consumer-resource interactions are both major determinants of spatial patchiness in ecosystems. However, interactive effects of these two mechanisms on spatial complexity have not been extensively studied. We investigated the mechanisms underlying a spatial mosaic of low-tide exposed hummocks and waterlogged hollows on an intertidal mudflat in the Wadden Sea dominated by the seagrass Zostera noltii. A combination of field measurements, an experiment and a spatially explicit model indicated that the mosaic resulted from localized sediment accretion by seagrass followed by selective waterfowl grazing. Hollows were bare in winter, but were rapidly colonized by seagrass during the growth season. Colonized hollows were heavily grazed by brent geese and widgeon in autumn, converting these patches to a bare state again and disrupting sediment accretion by seagrass. In contrast, hummocks were covered by seagrass throughout the year and were rarely grazed, most likely because the waterfowl were not able to employ their preferred but water requiring feeding strategy ('dabbling') here. Our study exemplifies that interactions between ecosystem engineering by a foundation species (seagrass) and consumption (waterfowl grazing) can increase spatial complexity at the landscape level.

AB  - Seawalls are an increasingly conspicuous component of coastlines, which may modify ecological communities through their effects on physical and biological processes. Effects of seawalls on ecological communities may vary spatially according to environmental conditions at the site of seawall placement, the local species pool, and the characteristics of the seawall itself. In the Austral Spring of 2014, we assessed how differences in infaunal communities between paired sedimentary sites with and without seawalls vary with tidal elevation and environmental conditions (i.e. sediment variables, benthic cover), at five locations within Brisbane Waters, New South Wales, Australia. Contrary to the prediction that differences in infaunal communities between sites with and without seawalls would be greatest at high intertidal elevation at which seawalls are built, we found greater differences at mid intertidal elevations. At muddy locations, characterised by high faunal abundance and richness, the abundance of mid intertidal infauna was less at sites with than without seawalls. By contrast, at sandy locations, which were characterised by low infaunal abundance and richness, the reverse pattern was seen. Although the structure of infaunal communities was correlated with sediment characteristics, sites with and without seawalls did not display consistent patterns of difference in sediment grain size or organic carbon content across locations. The greater difference in infaunal communities between sites with and without seawalls at mid than high or low intertidal elevations likely reflects an interaction between the proximity of habitat to seawalls and biological traits of the resident infaunal species that influence their susceptibility to perturbation.

AB  - Seagrasses are among the most threatened biomes worldwide. Until now, seagrass rehabilitation success has reached about 38% overall and more effective approaches to restoration are urgently needed. Here we report a novel method to rehabilitate Posidonia oceanica meadows based on observation of the species' natural recovery after disturbance. Posidonia oceanica rhizomes were transplanted on gabions filled with rocks of selected sizes in order to build a firm substrate with topographic complexity in the relevant scale range to propagules. Five techniques were tested, each involving a different anchoring device. The \"slot\" technique, which uses a wire-net pocket to retain the cuttings, was the most successful, with survival exceeding 85% after thirty months. Branching allowed final shoot survival to reach 422% of initial planting density. This study shows how an in-depth knowledge of species life history processes provides a suitable foundation for developing effective restoration methods that benefit from species recovery ability.

AB  - Sea-level rise poses a significant threat to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) due to the concentration of people, assets, and infrastructure in coastal zones. This review assesses literature on key emerging topics in sea level rise including: the lasting impact of near-term mitigation on long-term sea-level rise; new global coastal vertical elevation data and their impact on existing sea-level rise projections; and the interaction of sea-level rise with other hazards, including salinization, tropical cyclones and extreme precipitation. We characterize the regional nature of sea-level rise for SIDS and highlight associated impacts and risks. Finally, we review approaches to address sea-level rise as well as limits to adaptation and resultant economic and non-economic loss and damage that may be experienced by SIDS.

AB  - Sea-level rise (SLR) has been confirmed to be accelerating globally due to climate-change driven human influence. Multiple studies suggest many coastal communities will soon be inundated by SLR. Prior to inundation, habitable uplands above the high tide line first convert to uninhabitable wetlands, forcing human exodus. Habitability, not the land’s presence above the low tide line, drives exodus. We determined the time left for uplands of the Town of Tangier of VA, USA to be converted to wetlands, analyzed local sea level rise data to determine the best local SLR scenario (low, mid, or high) fit, then compared upland conversion rate to the rate of population decline. The upland landmass constituting the Town of Tangier declined from 32.8 HA to 12.5 HA (1967-2019), accelerating over time, with complete conversion to wetlands predicted by 2051. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) high SLR curve is the best fit to the local tide gauge’s raw data (1967-2020), indicating local sea level rise has rapidly accelerated in recent decades, concomitant with the rate of wetland conversion. The Town’s population, declining since the 1930s, accelerated rapidly after 1980, trending downward in tandem with the conversion of the Town’s uplands to wetlands. We estimated costs to relocate the Town as well as for a conceptual plan to provide long-term stability to the Town and Island of Tangier.

AB  - Sea cities are at the forefront of climate change. Globally, the developed coastline of many cities is at high risk of sea level rise, coastal flooding, and storm surge. Such risks, however, can turn into important opportunities for re-imagining the future of cities and their resilience and sustainability. Despite being controversial, unsettlement, re-settlement, retreat, temporary and permanent relocation, and climigration are concepts that are rapidly becoming an inevitable urban policy and planning consideration. Yet, the idea of a nomadic city, a city that moves, is not new. In fact, the oldest forms of human adaptation to coastal hazards have been through relocation to higher grounds. While temporary forms of relocation have long been prominent in disaster risk reduction efforts, permanent retreat and relocation of urban communities are increasingly becoming critical discussions in climate change adaptation. This chapter focuses on urban resilience to coastal hazards and explores strategies ranging from temporary retreat and managed retreat to migration as a land use policy that can create transformative opportunities for adaptation and re-imagines the future of sea cities in a changing climate. Case studies from around the world are presented, exploring the potential of policy responses as well as the key barriers and drivers for their implementation.

AB  - Saltmarshes are important coastal fringe ecosystems supporting a myriad of coastal uses and users. However, saltmarshes have undergone a significant period of global decline, losing 25%–50% of their coverage due to a range of drivers, but mainly as a result of anthropogenic pressures and land-use change. While the value of these coastal systems to society is recognised, global data are fragmented, patchy, and often restricted to local case studies. There is currently no comprehensive understanding of the global variation of ecosystem services, benefits and management practices available. This pioneering study addresses this by investigating the socio-ecological dimension of global variation in ecosystem service provision, and how this is being managed by and for different saltmarsh users. Through a global online questionnaire survey (n = 438) targeting professional saltmarsh researchers and practitioners representing 40 countries across 5 continents, this paper presents an overview of saltmarsh ecosystem services, key drivers influencing management and the variation in factors that influence them. Analysis indicates considerable variation, with geographical location (‘continent’) being the most common moderator, influencing perceptions of saltmarshes, the prioritisation of ecosystem services and management perceptions. Finally, the paper presents a series of recommendations, including the development of an interdisciplinary, international research programme to support restoration and conservation of saltmarshes worldwide.

AB  - Salt marshes provide valued services to coastal communities including nutrient cycling, erosion control, habitat provision for crustaceans and fish (including juvenile and forage fish), and energy transfer from the detrital based food web to the greater estuarine system. Living shorelines are erosion control structures that recreate natural shorelines, such as fringing marshes, while providing other beneficial ecosystem services. Living shorelines are expected to provide fish and crustacean (nekton) habitat, but few comprehensive studies have evaluated nekton habitat use across a range of living shoreline settings and ages. We sampled the intertidal marsh and subtidal shallow water nekton community at 13 paired living shoreline and reference marsh sites, with living shorelines ranging in age from 2 to 16 years from construction. We compared nekton diversity, nekton community abundance, nekton community biomass, forage abundance, and juvenile abundance at reference marshes and living shorelines. Our results indicate that living shorelines are providing suitable marsh habitat for nekton communities, including juveniles and forage base species. The difference in living shoreline construction (rock sill, soil composition) did not appear to diminish habitat quality in the marsh or in nearshore waters, and rock sills may provide enhanced structural shoreline habitat. Living shorelines have the potential to combat marsh habitat loss and provide resilient nekton nursery habitat. • Marshes are lost by shoreline hardening, but living shorelines create marsh habitat. • Nekton use younger and older living shorelines, and reference marshes similarly. • Rock sills do not alter nearshore nekton community, may provide enhanced refuge. • Living shorelines provide nursery habitat and trophic support like natural marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes provide important services to coastal ecosystems in the southeastern United States. In many locations, salt marsh habitats are threatened by coastal development and erosion, necessitating large-scale monitoring. Assessing vegetation height across the extent of a marsh can provide a comprehensive analysis of its health, as vegetation height is associated with Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and can be used to track degradation or growth over time. Traditional methods to do this, however, rely on manual measurements of stem heights that can cause harm to the marsh ecosystem. Moreover, manual measurements are limited in scale and are often time and labor intensive. Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) can provide an alternative to manual measurements and generate continuous results across a large spatial extent in a short period of time. In this study, a multirotor UAS equipped with optical Red Green Blue (RGB) and multispectral sensors was used to survey five salt marshes in Beaufort, North Carolina. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry of the resultant imagery allowed for continuous modeling of the entire marsh ecosystem in a three-dimensional space. From these models, vegetation height was extracted and compared to ground-based manual measurements. Vegetation heights generated from UAS data consistently under-predicted true vegetation height proportionally and a transformation was developed to predict true vegetation height. Vegetation height may be used as a proxy for Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and contribute to blue carbon estimates, which describe the carbon sequestered in marine ecosystems. Employing this transformation, our results indicate that UAS and SfM are capable of producing accurate assessments of salt marsh health via consistent and accurate vegetation height measurements.

AB  - Salt marshes can contribute to coastal protection, but the magnitude of the protection depends on the width of the marsh. The cross-shore width of the marsh is to a large extent determined by the delicate balance between seaward expansion and landward retreat. The influence of the magnitude of daily occurring mild weather conditions and sediment availability on the variability of salt marsh width has not been systematically assessed. This paper investigates how the magnitude of homogeneous hydrodynamic forcing, combined with sediment availability, affects the biophysical development, and more specifically retreat and expansion of salt marshes. The dynamic extent of the salt marsh is assessed by modeling online-coupled hydrodynamics, morphodynamics and vegetation growth using the numerical Delft3D-Flexible Mesh model, and a vegetation growth module. Simulated patterns around the salt marsh edge resembled field observations, as well as the simulated temporal variability of the lateral position of the salt marsh edge. In the model, the salt marsh extended seaward at low wave forcing (0.00 m; 0.05 m), and retreated landward at higher wave forcing (0.10 m; 0.15 m). With increasing physical stress, the salt marsh edge was found at lower elevations, indicating an unhealthy system with a retreating marsh edge due to vegetation mortality, whereas decreasing physical stresses result in a higher salt marsh edge, enabling expansion. This balance suggests the importance of response time of vegetation to physical stress. Yet, the salt marsh forced with higher waves was able to switch from a retreating extent retrogradational to an expansional behavior as sediment supply increased.

AB  - Salt marshes are dynamic biogeomorphic systems that respond to external physical factors, including tides, sediment transport, and waves and as well as internal processes such as autochthonous soild formation. Predicting the fate of marshes under future storms and sea-level rise requires a modeling framework that accounts for these processes in a coupled fashion. In this study, we implement two new marsh dynamic processes in the 3-D COAWST (coupled-ocean-atmosphere-wave sediment transport) model. The processes included are the erosion of the marsh edge scarp caused by lateral wave thrust from surface waves and vertical accretion driven by organic growth on the marsh platform. The edge erosion in the model occurs due to surface waves that reach grid cells at the marsh boundary; the associated lateral wave thrust lateral wave thrust leads to sediment release from these boundary cells to adjacent open water cells (non-marsh cells). Once a sufficient sediment is lost from a marsh-edge grid cell, the marsh cell is converted to a non-marsh cell, conceptually representing an intertidal mudflat. The sediment released from the marsh causes a change in bathymetry, thereby modifying the wave-energy reaching the marsh face. The vertical accretion occurs due to biomass production and is calculated by fitting a parabolic productivity curve between mean high water (MHW) and maximum vegetation depth for a given tidal range. MHW and tidal range are stored at user-defined intervals (on the order of days) as a hindcast and used to update the vertical growth formulation. Idealized domains are utilized to verify the lateral wave thrust formulation and show the dynamics of lateral wave erosion leading to horizontal retreat of marsh edge. The simulations of Reedy and Dinner Creeks within the Barnegat Bay estuary system show the model capability to account for both lateral wave erosion and vertical accretion due to organic growth in a realistic marsh complex. The simulations show that majority of accretion over the marsh complex occurs due to organic production while most estuarine sediment deposition occurs along the channel edges.

AB  - Salt marsh loss is projected to increase as sea-level rise accelerates with global climate change. Salt marsh loss occurs along both lateral creek and channel edges and in the marsh interior, when pannes expand and coalesce. Often, edge loss is attributed to erosive processes whereas dieback in the marsh interior is linked to excessive inundation or deposition of wrack, but remains poorly understood. We conducted a two-year field investigation in a central California estuary to identify key factors associated with panne contraction or expansion. Our study explored how an abundant burrowing crab, shown to have strong negative effects on marsh biomass near creek edges, affects panne dynamics. We also explored which physical panne attributes best predicted their dynamics. To our knowledge, ours is the first study of panne dynamics in a California marsh, despite how ubiquitous pannes are as a feature of marshes in the region and how often extensive marsh dieback occurs via panne expansion. Overall, we found that pannes contracted during the study period, but with variable rates of marsh recovery across pannes. Our model incorporating both physical and biological factors explained 86% of the variation in panne contraction. The model revealed a positive effect of crab activity, sediment accretion, and a composite of depth and elevation on panne contraction, and a negative effect of panne size and distance to nearest panne. The positive crab effects detected in pannes contrast with negative effects we detected near creek edges in a previous study, highlighting the context-dependence of top-down and bioturbation effects in marshes. As global change continues and the magnitude and frequency of disturbances increases, understanding the dynamics of marsh loss in the marsh interior as well as creek banks will be critical for the management of these coastal habitats.

AB  - Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea‐level rise, land‐use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short‐ and longer‐term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from −12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹, which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer‐term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site‐specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

AB  - Salicornia bigelovii Torr. is a potential new crop for coastal and saline lands, because of the oil content of its seeds, its properties as fresh vegetable, forage, and other uses. As a true halophyte, it can grow with seawater irrigation. The aim of this study was to determine the phenology and water requirements of Salicornia as a new plant resource in growing areas for salt-tolerant crops in coastal and saline lands, and elucidate scenarios of sustainability about these issues. Water requirements were estimated in experimental plots on the coastal line and fulfilled with drip irrigation connected to seawater aquaculture discharge ponds, 30 m from the sea. The recorded phenological events were germination, flowering, fructification, maturation, and physiological death. Results reflect the difficulty to adopt it as a new crop because of its long-life cycle, around nine months, contrasting with the life cycle of common crops, from three to four months. Irrigation needs reached a depth of 240 cm, significantly exceeding those of conventional crops. Such limitations are highlighted, but also its potential use as a biofilter of coastal aquaculture effluents, being a productive target-biomass, feasible to be used as a dual-purpose use of water and energy required in aquaculture farms.

AB  - Roads increase wildlife mortality and present a movement barrier for many species. While wildlife passages have been advocated as a solution to many of the problems associated with roads, they are expensive and many roads still have none. However, roads usually have a series of drainage culverts designed to allow water to cross underneath the road, which might also be used by some mammals. This study aims to (1) determine what variables influence the number of successful passages of drainage culverts by mammals, and to (2) parse the effects that these variables have on the entry into and subsequent full passage of drainage culverts by individual mammals, using cameras and animal track stations along a 20 km stretch of autoroute 10 in Southern Quebec (Canada). Overall, 20 species were observed outside of the drainage culverts, but only about half of them were detected making full crossings. While various species were often seen outside, only animals highly tolerant to water, including raccoons (Procyon lotor) and American mink (Neovison vison), were observed fully crossing the structures with regularity, whereas the number of full crossings was small (AU - Brunen, Benjamin

AB  - Rising sea levels are causing more frequent flooding events in coastal areas and generate many issues for coastal communities such as loss of property or damages to infrastructures. To address this issue, this paper reviews measures currently in place and identifies possible control measures that can be implemented to aid preservation of coastlines in the future. Breakwaters present a unique opportunity to proactively address the impact of coastal flooding. However, there is currently a lack of research into combined hard and soft engineering techniques. To address the global need for developing sustainable solutions, three specific breakwater configurations were designed and experimentally compared in the hydraulic laboratory at Coventry University to assess their performance in reducing overtopping and the impact of waves, quantifying the effectiveness of each. The investigation confirmed that stepped configurations work effectively in high amplitudes waves, especially with the presence of a slope angle to aid wave reflection. These results provide a very valuable preliminary investigation into novel sustainable solutions incorporating both artificial and natural based strategies that could be considered by local and national authorities for the planning of future mitigation strategies to defend coastal areas from flooding and erosion.

AB  - Rising sea levels and increasing frequency of extreme events put coastal communities at serious risk. In response, shoreline armoring for stabilization has been widespread; however, this solution does not take ecological aspects of the coasts into account. The “living shoreline” technique includes coastal ecology by incorporating natural habitat features, such as saltmarshes, into shoreline stabilization. However, impacts of living shorelines to adjacent benthic communities, like submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), are not clear yet. In particular, while both marshes and SAV trap sediment necessary for their resilience to environmental change, synergies between the communities are not well understood. To help quantify the ecological and protective (shoreline stabilization) aspects of living shorelines, we present modeling results using the Delft3D-SWAN system on sediment transport between the created saltmarshes of the living shorelines and adjacent SAV in a subestuary of Chesapeake Bay. We used a double numerical approach, first to validate deposition measurements made in the field and second to quantify a sediment balance between the two vegetation communities using an idealized model. This model uses the same numerical domain with different wave heights, periods, and basin slope and includes the presence of rip-rap, often used together with marsh plantings in living shorelines, to look at influences of artificial structures on the sediment exchange between the plant communities. Study results indicate lower shear stress, lower erosion rate, and higher deposition rates within the SAV bed compared to the scenario with only marsh, which helps stabilize bottom sediments by making the sediment balance positive (deposition within the two vegetations higher than sediment loss). The presence of rip-rap resulted in a positive sediment balance especially in case of extreme events, where sediment balance was magnified. Overall, SAV helps stabilize bed level and shoreline, and rip-rap works better with extreme conditions, demonstrating how the right combination of natural and built solutions can work well in terms of ecology and coastal protection.

AB  - Rising sea levels and growing coastal populations are intensifying interactions at the land-sea interface. To stabilize upland and protect human developments from coastal hazards, landowners commonly emplace hard armoring structures, such as bulkheads and revetments, along estuarine shorelines. The ecological and economic consequences of shoreline armoring have garnered significant attention; however, few studies have examined the extent of hard armoring or identified drivers of hard armoring patterns at the individual landowner level across large geographical areas. This study addresses this knowledge gap by using a fine-scale census of hard armoring along the entire Georgia U.S. estuarine coastline. We develop a parsimonious statistical model that accurately predicts the probability of armoring emplacement at the parcel level based on a set of environmental and socioeconomic variables. Several interacting influences contribute to patterns of shoreline armoring; in particular, shoreline slope and the presence of armoring on a neighboring parcel are strong predictors of armoring. The model also suggests that continued sea level rise and coastal population growth could trigger future increases in armoring, emphasizing the importance of considering dynamic patterns of armoring when evaluating the potential effects of sea level rise. For example, evolving distributions of armoring should be considered in predictions of future salt marsh migration. The modeling approach developed in this study is adaptable to assessing patterns of hard armoring in other regions. With improved understanding of hard armoring distributions, sea level rise response plans can be fully informed to design more efficient scenarios for both urban development and coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Reversing the decline of coastal marine ecosystems will rely extensively on ecological restoration. This will in turn rely on ensuring adequate supply and survival of propagules — for the main habitat-forming taxa of coastal marine ecosystems these are mainly fruits, seeds, viviparous seedlings, zoospores or larvae. The likelihood of propagule survival — and so restoration success — depends on species- and context-specific knowledge to guide choices about appropriate methods to use. Here, we briefly review life-histories of the main habitat-forming taxa of six coastal marine ecosystems: mangrove forests, tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, kelp forests, coral reefs and bivalve reefs. Restoration of several of these ecosystems has long harnessed the unique properties of propagules, sometimes because they are simple to use (for example, planting propagules of some mangroves), and sometimes because we can draw on knowledge gained from other applications (for example using knowledge of oyster culture to restore bivalve reefs). For other ecosystems, like seagrass meadows, kelp forests and coral reefs, propagules have not yet been widely used, but there is compelling evidence that they can be. Most restoration efforts have used relatively simple techniques, such as manual collection and direct planting or seeding. Some approaches use more complex techniques which include a stage in which propagules are reared in nurseries or aquaria to a size or age at which they are viable, when they are then planted or released at the site to be restored. Other approaches use minimal intervention, and focus instead on providing the conditions that will promote growth from naturally-dispersed propagules (such as restoring hydrological conditions to facilitate mangrove recruitment). Future approaches could incorporate knowledge applied from other fields, such as genetics and agriculture, and harness the possibilities provided by technology. Understanding the importance of propagule quality will likely also yield insights, as will effective use of models to help refine restoration methods for testing. Deeper partnerships between practitioners and researchers will help test and develop better methods so that we can learn from each other and strive to improve. Propagules offer multiple promising avenues to expand coastal marine restoration efforts and help achieve global ambitions.

AB  - Restored oyster reefs enhance commercial harvests and ecosystem services in coastal environments. Spatial and temporal changes in habitat availability can affect reef persistence and restoration benefits, and understanding how construction and location of a restored habitat influence its persistence over time is key to optimizing restoration efforts. The short-term persistence of six subtidal restored oyster reefs in Pamlico Sound, NC, USA was characterized by sidescan sonar and bathymetric mapping conducted immediately after restoration in August 2016 and again 21 months later in May 2018. A U-net convolutional neural network architecture was trained to classify reef pixels within the sonar imagery using image-based and image-texture features calculated from gray-level co-occurrence matrices. Oyster reef restoration used shell and limestone marl to construct flat substrates, with only a few 10’s of centimeters of local relief, spread over areas of ~3000–12,000 m2. All six reefs provided habitat for the settlement and growth of oyster populations, but this role changed as reefs underwent varying degrees of sediment burial between surveys. Reefs constructed in relatively low-energy environments lost ~18–35% of their substrate area, primarily by deposition of sediment along their margins. Reefs having greater sediment supply and greater exposure to predominant winds and currents were most susceptible to burial and became heavily fragmented with ~50–65% of the restored habitat lost. Sediment dynamics appear to exert a controlling influence on the success of these reefs, and oyster restoration sites in high-energy environments may have limited long-term economic and ecosystem benefits.

AB  - Restoration of foundation species promises to reverse environmental degradation and return lost ecosystem services, but a lack of standardized evaluation across projects limits understanding of recovery, especially in marine systems. Oyster reefs are restored to reverse massive global declines and reclaim valuable ecosystem services, but the success of these projects has not been systematically and comprehensively quantified. We synthesized data on ecosystem services associated with oyster restoration from 245 pairs of restored and degraded reefs and 136 pairs of restored and reference reefs across 3500 km of U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastlines. On average, restoration was associated with a 21-fold increase in oyster production (mean log response ratio = 3.08 [95% confidence interval: 2.58-3.58]), 34-97% enhancement of habitat provisioning (mean community abundance = 0.51 [0.41-0.61], mean richness = 0.29 [0.19-0.39], and mean biomass = 0.69 [0.39-0.99]), 54% more nitrogen removal (mean = 0.43 [0.13-0.73]), and 89-95% greater sediment nutrients (mean = 0.67 [0.27-1.07]) and organic matter (mean = 0.64 [0.44-0.84]) relative to degraded habitats. Moreover, restored reefs matched reference reefs for these ecosystem services. Our results support the continued and expanded use of oyster restoration to enhance ecosystem services of degraded coastal systems and match many functions provided by reference reefs.

AB  - Restoration of degraded ecosystems is an important societal goal, yet inadequate monitoring and the absence of clear performance metrics are common criticisms of many habitat restoration projects. Funding limitations can prevent adequate monitoring, but we suggest that the lack of accepted metrics to address the diversity of restoration objectives also presents a serious challenge to the monitoring of restoration projects. A working group with experience in designing and monitoring oyster reef projects was used to develop standardized monitoring metrics, units, and performance criteria that would allow for comparison among restoration sites and projects of various construction types. A set of four universal metrics (reef areal dimensions, reef height, oyster density, and oyster size–frequency distribution) and a set of three universal environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) are recommended to be monitored for all oyster habitat restoration projects regardless of their goal(s). In addition, restoration goal-based metrics specific to four commonly cited ecosystem service-based restoration goals are recommended, along with an optional set of seven supplemental ancillary metrics that could provide information useful to the interpretation of prerestoration and postrestoration monitoring data. Widespread adoption of a common set of metrics with standardized techniques and units to assess well-defined goals not only allows practitioners to gauge the performance of their own projects but also allows for comparison among projects, which is both essential to the advancement of the field of oyster restoration and can provide new knowledge about the structure and ecological function of oyster reef ecosystems.

AB  - Restoration of degraded coastal and estuarine habitats owing to human activities is a major global concern. In Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A., removal of hard armor from beaches and intertidal zones has become a priority for state and local agencies. However, the effectiveness of these shoreline restoration programs for subtidal habitats and fish is unknown. We surveyed six restoration sites in Puget Sound over 2 years to evaluate associations between shoreline restoration and subtidal fish abundance. We measured the abundance of juvenile salmonids and forage fishes along armored, restored, and reference shorelines. Bayesian generalized linear models showed limited support for associations between shoreline restoration and these fishes in the 3-7 years since armor removal. Pacific herring were more abundant at reference shorelines; the shoreline effect for surf smelt varied by survey site. Shoreline restoration was not an important predictor of salmonid abundance; the best models for Chinook and chum salmon included predictors for survey site and eelgrass, respectively. The retention of survey site in several species' top models reveals the influence of the broader landscape context. We also found seasonal variation in abundance for chum salmon and surf smelt. Our results suggest that juvenile forage fish and salmonids in estuaries likely have unique responses to shoreline features, and that the positive effects of armor removal either do not extend into subtidal areas or are not detectable at local scales. To be most effective, coastal restoration programs should consider broader landscape patterns as well as species-specific habitat needs when prioritizing investments.

AB  - Restoration of coastal ecosystem engineers that trap sediment and dampen waves has proven to be difficult, especially in the wave‐exposed and eroding areas where they are needed the most. Environmental stressors, such as hydrodynamic stress and predation, can only be overcome if transplanted organisms are able to establish self‐facilitating feedbacks. We investigate if the artificial lowering of multiple environmental stressors can be used to give transplanted juveniles the opportunity to form a self‐sustainable system and thereby increase their long‐term survival on wave‐exposed and eroding shores. We designed a large field experiment using juvenile mussels (Mytilus edulis ) as model species on a wave‐exposed tidal flat in the Oosterschelde estuary (the Netherlands). We tested if the environmental stress caused by a high predation pressure and wave‐driven dislodgement could be reduced by a combination of artificial structures such as fences (to exclude predatory crabs), attachment substrates (such as coir‐net or oyster shells) and breakwaters. Despite a low overall mussel survival (29%), we found that under strong hydrodynamic conditions, experimental fences and attachment substrates increased the retention of transplanted mussel seed. However, modification of local hydrodynamic conditions using breakwaters did not improve mussel coverage preservation. Overall, this study highlights the potential of using techniques that lower multiple environmental stressors to create a window of opportunity for establishment in highly dynamic ecosystems.

AB  - Restoration is increasingly implemented as a strategy to mitigate global declines in biogenic habitats, such as salt marshes and oyster reefs. Restoration efforts could be improved if we knew how site characteristics at landscape scales affect the ecological success of these foundation species. In this study, we determined how salt marsh shoreline geomorphologies (e.g. with variable hydrodynamic energy, fetch, erosion rates, and slopes) affect the success of restored intertidal oyster reefs, as well as how fauna utilize restored reefs and forage along marsh habitats. We constructed oyster reefs along three marsh shoreline geomorphologies in May 2012: 1) “creek” (small‐fetch, gradual‐sloped shoreline), “ramp” (large‐fetch, gradual‐sloped shoreline), and “scarp” (large‐fetch, steep‐sloped shoreline). Following recruitment, oyster spat density was greatest on ramp reefs; however, 2 years later, the highest adult oyster densities were found on creek reefs. Total nekton and blue crab catch rates in trawl nets were highest in the creek, while piscivore catch rates in gill nets were highest along the scarp shoreline. We found no difference in predation on snails in the salt marsh behind constructed reef and nonconstructed reference sites, but there were more snails consumed in the creek shoreline, which corresponded with the distribution of their major predator—blue crabs. We conclude that oyster reef construction was most successful for oysters in small‐fetch, gradual‐sloped, creek environments. However, nekton abundance did not always follow the same trends as oyster density, which could suggest constructed reefs may offer similar habitat‐related functions (prey availability and refuge) already present along existing salt marsh borders.

AB  - Restoration is considered an effective strategy to accelerate the recovery of biological communities at local scale. However, the effects of restoration actions in the marine ecosystems are still unpredictable. We performed a global analysis of published literature to identify the factors increasing the probability of restoration success in coastal and marine systems. Our results confirm that the majority of active restoration initiatives are still concentrated in the northern hemisphere and that most of information gathered from restoration efforts derives from a relatively small subset of species. The analysis also indicates that many studies are still experimental in nature, covering small spatial and temporal scales. Despite the limits of assessing restoration effectiveness in absence of a standardized definition of success, the context (degree of human impact, ecosystem type, habitat) of where the restoration activity is undertaken is of greater relevance to a successful outcome than how (method) the restoration is carried out. Contrary to expectations, we found that restoration is not necessarily more successful closer to protected areas and in areas of moderate human impact. This result can be motivated by the limits in assessing the success of interventions and by the tendence of selecting areas in more obvious need of restoration, where the potential of actively restoring a degraded site is more evident. Restoration sites prioritization considering human uses and conservation status present in the region is of vital importance to obtain the intended outcomes and galvanize further actions.

AB  - Restoration is becoming a vital tool to counteract coastal ecosystem degradation. Modifying transplant designs of habitat-forming organisms from dispersed to clumped can amplify coastal restoration yields as it generates self-facilitation from emergent traits, i.e. traits not expressed by individuals or small clones, but that emerge in clumped individuals or large clones. Here, we advance restoration science by mimicking key emergent traits that locally suppress physical stress using biodegradable establishment structures. Experiments across (sub)tropical and temperate seagrass and salt marsh systems demonstrate greatly enhanced yields when individuals are transplanted within structures mimicking emergent traits that suppress waves or sediment mobility. Specifically, belowground mimics of dense root mats most facilitate seagrasses via sediment stabilization, while mimics of aboveground plant structures most facilitate marsh grasses by reducing stem movement. Mimicking key emergent traits may allow upscaling of restoration in many ecosystems that depend on self-facilitation for persistence, by constraining biological material requirements and implementation costs.

AB  - Restoration efforts with native eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere have been limited by shell availability, necessitating the use of alternative structures as subtidal reefs, yet these have rarely been evaluated quantitatively. We quantified population structure, density, abundance and biomass of eastern oyster and hooked mussel, Ischadium recurvum, on a concrete modular reef (75 m2 surface area over 5 m2 of river bottom) deployed subtidally at 7 m depth in the Rappahannock River, Virginia during October, 2000. After nearly 5 y (May 2005), we took 120 stratified random samples over the reef. The reef was heavily colonized by 28-168 oysters and 14-2177 mussels m-2 surface area. These densities translate to 1085 oysters and 8617 mussels m-2 river bottom, which are the highest recorded for artificial oyster reefs. Size structure of oysters reflected four year classes, with over half of oysters more than 1 y old and of reproductive age. Oyster biomass (1663 g dry mass m-2 river bottom) and condition index were equally high, whereas parasite prevalence and intensity were low. Oyster density correlated positively in a sigmoid fashion with mussel density up to high densities, then declined. This modular reef is one of the most successful artificial reefs for eastern oyster and hooked mussel restoration, and details features that are conducive for successful settlement, growth and survival in subtidal habitats.

AB  - Responsiveness and resilience to coastal disasters is an increasingly critical need for governments, businesses, and communities as the intensity of hurricanes, coastal storms and sea level rise exacerbates flood and erosion damages. The number and severity of disasters have increased significantly over the past two decades while intense coastal development has steadily degraded the protective and other ecosystem benefits from natural habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses. Such ecosystems can provide cost-effective, long-term risk reduction and other benefits to coastal communities. Yet easy, low-cost methodologies for incorporating such natural capital values into metrics that can inform policy and investment decisions have been lacking until recently. Whereas new approaches and studies have developed ways to quantify and assess such risk reduction benefits, finding the data to assess such services in data poor environments, both for regional and local scales, remains challenging. This paper outlines how breakthroughs in data technologies can help with incorporating ecosystem benefits into real-world policy and investment applications. Specific new data and analytical technologies are increasingly being used to quantify coastal risk reduction and other ecosystem benefits. We review several case studies where ecosystem benefits were quantified based on new data technologies and used for policy and investment strategies to improve a broader suite of ecosystem benefits to coastal communities. Equipping public and private sector actors with cost-effective and accessible approaches and tools to incorporate nature-based solutions into disaster risk management and coastal zone management planning more generally can transform climate resilience strategies around the world.

AB  - Relatively high-latitude waters are supposed as a refuge for corals under ocean warming. A systematic assessment of the Weizhou Island reef in the northern South China Sea, a relatively high-latitude region, shows that the ecosystem restoration index decreased from 0.96 to 0.62 during the period between 1990 and 2015. Although the biotic community, supporting services, and regulating services remained at good or very good states, the provisioning services, cultural services, and especially habitat structure deteriorated to very poor or moderate states. Gray relational analysis showed that these ecological declines exhibited a strong relationship with human pressures from tourism activities and the petrochemical industry. The recoveries of the biotic community and supporting services that benefited from wintertime warming appeared to be partly offset by intensive human pressures. The long-term effects on ecosystem structure and functions suggest that anthropogenic disturbances have impaired the possibility of this area serving as a potential thermal refuge for reef-building corals in the South China Sea. This study thus provides an integrated approach for assessing the adaptive responses of coral reef ecosystems to climate change and local human activities.

AB  - Reefs are known to provide coastal protection and important ecosystem services for many coastlines around the world. Physical processes such as wave damping, sediment transport and nearshore hydrodynamics are closely related to the coastal protection services provided by reefs. The steep-fronted bathymetries of reefs cause abrupt wave transformations and wave damping alongshore, while reef roughness has an important contribution to coastal protection. Five Latin-American case studies are presented to illustrate the coastal protection offered by reefs and their contribution to wave damping. The methodologies applied (e.g. numerical modelling, field measurements) and reef conditions (e.g. reef degradation scenarios and contribution of reef roughness) are listed. Considerable efforts have been made towards diagnosing, understanding and modelling the hydrodynamic transformations induced by reefs. Based on physical and field surveys, roughness and friction parameters were derived in order to implement calibrated and validated numerical models. Discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the different models applied in the study cases is provided as well as on the needs of highlighting physical processes and the analysis of reef hydrodynamics for supporting appropriate ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Reef-building eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, provide many ecosystem services, including production of valuable commercial products, formation of complex habitats, improved water quality and shoreline protection. Despite this, oyster populations have experienced dramatic declines throughout their range, spawning massive investment in management and restoration. Restoration efforts typically consider several well-studied metrics that normally influence oyster success; however, one potential factor that has not received much prior attention is submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). We conducted a series of field surveys and field experiments to explore the relationship between SGD and oysters in a marsh-lined tidal creek in Georgia, USA. SGD was mapped across multiple time points using a natural radon tracer (radon-222), and fluxes were paired with discrete measurements of oyster density, condition, size, recruitment and growth at multiple locations along the creek. Variation in oyster metrics was best explained by a combination of SGD, pH, and DO, which displayed a high degree of multicollinearity. We found an overall negative, nonlinear relationship between oyster density and groundwater flux. Interestingly, juvenile and adult condition and growth were not negatively impacted by groundwater. Rather, our results suggest that the likely mechanism for the density-flux relationship was interruption of the larval recruitment, which was also negatively related to flux. We hypothesize that larval interruption is due to the low dissolved oxygen and pH conditions of the groundwater at high flux sites. Overall, the interaction between SGD and oysters appears complex, and may be affected by other variables. This study provides evidence of a potential negative effect of a previously understudied natural phenomena on oyster demographics, and we suggest that SGD be considered in future management efforts.

AB  - Reef-building bivalves like oysters and mussels are conspicuous ecosystem engineers in intertidal and subtidal coastal environments. By forming complex, three-dimensional structures on top of the sediment surface, epibenthic bivalve reefs exert strong bio-physical interactions, thereby influencing local hydro- and morphodynamics as well as surrounding habitats and associated species. The spatial impact of the ecosystem engineering effects of reef-building bivalves is much larger than the size of the reef. By influencing hydrodynamics oysters and mussels modify the sedimentary environment far beyond the boundaries of the reef, affecting morphological and ecological processes up to several hundreds of meters.

AB  - Recreational fishing is an important wildlife harvesting activity in urban coastal areas, and recreational harvest in these areas can frequently exceed the commercial harvest. Recreational fishing is a key way that many members of the public experience the environment. The activity enhances social capital, promotes respect for nature, provides health benefits and can provide economic benefits to coastal communities. It is also an important driver of the science on aquatic animals and habitats, and an important tangible reason for many members of the public to conserve and protect aquatic resources. Overall, there has been little specific consideration of urban recreational fisheries management in Australia, despite the paramount importance of urban areas as a focus of recreational fishing activity. This paper identifies that in order to maximize individual and societal benefits from recreational fishing, there needs to be a refocussing of management with the aim of being more holistic. Historically, fisheries management in Australia has focused on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) or maximum economic yield (MEY) which is relevant for the commercial fishing sector, but neither of these is directly relevant to recreational fisheries. This paper identifies that Urban Fisheries Management Plans are required that recognize the specific issues associated with urban recreational fisheries. These plans need to coordinate within and between levels of government and have clear management objectives relevant to urban recreational fisheries. Enhanced opportunities for meaningful citizen science can be incorporated at multiple levels within these plans and this can engender public support for environmental stewardship, as well as fill a very important gap in the knowledge base necessary for managing the activity. As urban recreational fisheries are often occurring in highly modified or degraded habitats, a central element of these plans needs to be habitat restoration and this can have broader benefits for aquatic health. Other management tools include habitat creation (e.g., artificial reefs), optimization of coastal infrastructure as fisheries habitat, and stock enhancement. Overall, Urban Fisheries Management Plans represent a necessary evolution of fisheries management to better address the specific challenges of urban recreational fisheries management, and to best ensure that benefits are optimised.

AB  - Recognizing the historical loss of habitats and the value and opportunities for their recovery is essential for mobilizing habitat restoration as a solution for managing ecosystem function. Just 200 years ago, Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata) formed extensive reef ecosystems along Australia's temperate east coast, but a century of intensive harvest and coastal change now confines S. glomerata to encrusting the hard-intertidal surfaces of sheltered coastal waters. Despite the lack of natural reef recovery, there appears enormous potential for the restoration of intertidal S. glomerata ecosystems across Australia's east coast, with large anticipated benefits to water quality, shoreline protection, and coastal productivity. Yet, no subtidal reefs remain and the potential for subtidal restoration is a critical knowledge gap. Here, we synthesize historical, ecological, and aquaculture literature to describe a reference system for the traits of S. glomerata reefs to inform restoration targets, and outline the barriers to, and opportunities and methods for, their restoration. These reefs support extremely biodiverse and productive communities and can ameliorate the environmental stress experienced by associated communities. Rock oyster restoration, therefore, provides an ecosystem-based strategy for assisting the adaptation of marine biodiversity to a changing climate and intensive human encroachment. Though an estimated 92% of S. glomerata ecosystems are lost, there remains great potential to restore these valuable and resilient ecosystems.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that increasing habitat complexity of artificial seawalls by modifying surface heterogeneity could enhance exploitable habitat and therefore species richness and abundance. We tested the effects of adding complex tiles (with crevices/ledges) of different heterogeneity (i.e., flat tiles resembling the seawall vs. tiles with crevices of 2.5 cm or 5.0 cm depth) and seeding with native rock oysters, Saccostrea cuccullata (unseeded vs. seeded) on species richness and abundances of intertidal marine organisms on two vertical seawalls in Hong Kong. Tiles were affixed to the mid-intertidal zone of the seawalls for 12 months. The results showed that the tiles with crevices had greater species richness and cover of sessile epifauna than flat tiles. Seeding tiles with S. cuccullata also facilitated natural recruitment of the same species. Our results support the hypothesis that using eco-engineering to increase habitat complexity can enhance the biodiversity of intertidal marine organisms on seawalls.

AB  - Recent restoration efforts for the native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, are commonly motivated by potential return of oyster-associated ecosystem services, including increased water filtration. The potential impact of such restoration on another species of ecological concern, eelgrass, Zostera marina, is unclear, but has been hypothesized to be positive if oyster filter feeding increases light penetration to eelgrass. For two years after construction of an oyster restoration project, we assessed the response of adjacent eelgrass (impact) compared to control and reference eelgrass beds by monitoring changes in light intensity, eelgrass shoot density, biomass, leaf morphometrics, and epiphyte load. We observed lower light intensity consistently over time, including prior to restoration, near the constructed oyster bed relative to the control and one of the reference locations. We also observed minor variations between control and impact eelgrass morphology and density. However, the changes observed were not outside the range of natural variation expected in this system, based upon comparisons to reference eelgrass beds, nor were they detrimental. This limited impact to eelgrass may be due in part to the incorporation of a buffer distance between the restored oyster bed and the existing eelgrass bed, which may have dampened both positive and negative impacts. These findings provide evidence that Olympia oyster restoration and eelgrass conservation goals can be compatible and occur simultaneously.

AB  - Recent research revealing the extent of marine habitat degradation has ignited a surge of restoration efforts globally. Restoration of estuarine habitats became a priority in the United States with the Estuary Restoration Act (ERA) of 2000. In the present study, a synthesis of data from the National Estuaries Restoration Inventory (NERI), developed in response to ERA requirements to track and disseminate project data, was conducted in order to analyze U.S. oyster reef restoration efforts. From 2000–2011, more than $45 million was invested in 187 projects to restore over 150 ha of oyster reef habitat, with projects most heavily concentrated in the Chesapeake Bay area and Florida Gulf coast. Trends over time indicate that projects are being implemented at larger scales, increasing from an average of less than 0.4 ha in 2000 to over 1 ha on average in 2011. Costs per unit decreased from an average of more than $2.1 million per ha in 2000 to just over $500,000 per ha in 2011. However, our analysis confirms one major problem hindering the field of restoration ecology: a lack of monitoring data or project-specific assessments of success. Habitat restoration has become an increasingly common effort in the policy sector, and gaps identified through this analysis can help inform future policy making and implementation. Better facilitation of data dissemination and further research on economies of scale in restoration projects are two key areas for improvement. As the field of restoration ecology continues to grow, it is critical that both new and current restoration practitioners, scientists, and decision-makers are able to learn from past projects and apply that collective knowledge to future restoration efforts.

AB  - Recent concern over the loss of estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) often focuses on an important service provided by these ecosystems, their role in protecting coastal communities from storms that damage property and cause deaths and injury. Certain ECEs, especially mangroves, marshes, seagrasses and near-shore coral reefs, may significantly reduce storm surges through attenuating waves. This function is key to the protective value of ECEs, which is used as a basis for coastal restoration efforts worldwide. In a wealth accounting framework, net domestic product (NDP) should be adjusted for the direct benefits provided by the current stock of this restored ecological capital but not for their indirect contributions in terms of protecting or supporting economic activity, property and human livelihoods. If ecosystem restoration leads to the creation of new ecological landscape, including transforming developed land back to ecological capital, then NDP must be further modified to reflect any capital revaluation that occurs. Both the current benefits of restoration and any capitalized land values must be adjusted if there is a risk of restoration failure. These issues encountered in a wealth accounting approach to the protective value of ECEs is illustrated with reference to the case of marsh creation in Louisiana, USA, in light of the 2012 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan.

AB  - Recent coastal storms and associated recovery efforts have led to increased investment in nature-based coastal protection, including restoration of salt marshes and construction of living shorelines. In particular, many of these efforts focus on increasing vertical elevation through sediment nourishment, where sediment is removed from the tidal channel and placed on the marsh plain, or preventing lateral erosion through shoreline protection. In the USA alone, millions of dollars have been allocated or spent on these coastal protection solutions over the last few decades because of their perceived sustainability and ecologically positive co-benefits including habitat provision and carbon sequestration. These projects would benefit from integration of sediment transport pathways, budgets, and metrics during planning and modeling of restoration outcomes, in order to evaluate sustainability before investment. This is analogous to the decades of experience with coastal management and engineering on the open coast. Salt marshes are geomorphic features that rely partially on external sediment supply to maintain their network of tidal channels, intertidal flats, and marsh plain. Removing sediment from one component of the overall system to nourish another component may be counterproductive, given that the net sediment budget is unchanged. For example, dredging a tidal channel beyond its equilibrium condition will cause it to fill with sediment from the tidal flat or elsewhere in the system. This may cause slumping of the marsh edge, or over-deepening of other sections of the channel to compensate. Similarly, shoreline protection that prevents edge erosion hampers the marsh plain’s ability to accrete on the levee and naturally transgress landward or it starves other components of the system of regularly supplied sediment. A limited vertical or lateral-only perspective, instead of a three-dimensional perspective, during project planning and evaluation may lead to suboptimal decision-making regarding restoration priorities, approaches, and outcomes. I contend that before significant investments are made in marsh restoration through sediment nourishment or shoreline protection, sediment transport measurements and models that consider sediment dynamics should be integrated into the early phases of restoration planning. This will help identify where and under what conditions marsh restoration will most likely be successful and economically justified. Triaging and prioritizing is then possible, which is a sustainable approach for restoration, given the persistent vulnerability of marshes to sea-level rise, storms, and sediment deficits.

AB  - Recent calls for ocean planning envision informed management of social and ecological systems to sustain delivery of ecosystem services to people. However, until now, no coastal and marine planning process has applied an ecosystem-services framework to understand how human activities affect the flow of benefits, to create scenarios, and to design a management plan. We developed models that quantify services provided by corals, mangroves, and seagrasses. We used these models within an extensive engagement process to design a national spatial plan for Belize’s coastal zone. Through iteration of modeling and stakeholder engagement, we developed a preferred plan, currently under formal consideration by the Belizean government. Our results suggest that the preferred plan will lead to greater returns from coastal protection and tourism than outcomes from scenarios oriented toward achieving either conservation or development goals. The plan will also reduce impacts to coastal habitat and increase revenues from lobster fishing relative to current management. By accounting for spatial variation in the impacts of coastal and ocean activities on benefits that ecosystems provide to people, our models allowed stakeholders and policymakers to refine zones of human use. The final version of the preferred plan improved expected coastal protection by >25% and more than doubled the revenue from fishing, compared with earlier versions based on stakeholder preferences alone. Including outcomes in terms of ecosystem-service supply and value allowed for explicit consideration of multiple benefits from oceans and coasts that typically are evaluated separately in management decisions.

AB  - Rapidly developing coastal regions face consequences of land use and climate change including flooding and increased sediment, nutrient, and chemical runoff, but these forces may also enhance pathogen runoff, which threatens human, animal, and ecosystem health. Using the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii in California, USA as a model for coastal pathogen pollution, we examine the spatial distribution of parasite runoff and the impacts of precipitation and development on projected pathogen delivery to the ocean. Oocysts, the extremely hardy free-living environmental stage of T. gondii shed in faeces of domestic and wild felids, are carried to the ocean by freshwater runoff. Linking spatial pathogen loading and transport models, we show that watersheds with the highest levels of oocyst runoff align closely with regions of increased sentinel marine mammal T. gondii infection. These watersheds are characterized by higher levels of coastal development and larger domestic cat populations. Increases in coastal development and precipitation independently raised oocyst delivery to the ocean (average increases of 44% and 79%, respectively), but dramatically increased parasite runoff when combined (175% average increase). Anthropogenic changes in landscapes and climate can accelerate runoff of diverse pathogens from terrestrial to aquatic environments, influencing transmission to people, domestic animals, and wildlife.

AB  - Rapid population growth and coastal development are primary drivers of marine habitat degradation. Although shoreline hardening or armoring (the addition of concrete structures such as seawalls, jetties, and groins), a byproduct of development, can accelerate erosion and loss of beaches and tidal wetlands, it is a common practice globally. Here, we provide the first estimate of shoreline hardening along US Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico coasts and predict where future armoring may result in tidal wetland loss if coastal management practices remain unchanged. Our analysis indicates that 22 842 km of continental US shoreline – approximately 14% of the total US coastline – has been armored. We also consider how socioeconomic and physical factors relate to the pervasiveness of shoreline armoring and show that housing density, gross domestic product, storms, and wave height are positively correlated with hardening. Over 50% of South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts are fringed with tidal wetlands that...

AB  - Rapid coastal development has generated interest in the ecology of human-modified marine environments. Coastal defence structures such as breakwaters and seawalls are increasingly built to reduce erosion and to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise but knowledge on the marine biodiversity around these structures is lacking. Benthic cover and fish community were surveyed at nine offshore sites, comprising seven coral reefs and two seawalls, in the Singapore’s highly urbanised reef system. A total of 4943 fishes from 70 taxa were recorded, dominated by Pomacentridae (56.5%) and Labridae (17.7%). The results showed a clear spatial variation in the fish community structure across the reefs. The southwestern reefs supported fish communities that were significantly different from those in the south. Generic diversity was significantly higher at the southwestern reefs than the southern ones while the abundance and generic richness were similar. The differences in fish community structure were moderately correlated with the abundance of coralline algae, foliose and submassive corals. The seawall sites supported fish communities different from coral reefs that were adjacent to them. While abundance was similar, the former had higher generic richness and diversity than the latter. The difference in community was attributed to two pomacentrid genera (i.e. Neopomacentrus and Pomacentrus) which were more abundant at the reefs. The findings demonstrated that urbanised coastal ecosystems can contribute to supporting fish diversity.

AB  - Question: Do low stone dams built to prevent erosion and to restore salt marshes through increased sedimentation affect plant species composition? Location: Dutch Wadden Sea area (ca. 53°N 5°E). Methods: Releves (N = 170) were made of the vegetation of two restored salt marsh sites on the barrier islands Terschelling (Grie) and Ameland (Neerlands Reid). Existing releves of salt-marsh vegetation (N = 6198) made along the entire Dutch Wadden Sea coast (both the mainland and the barrier islands) were used as a reference. The vegetation of the two restored sites (Grie NLR data) was compared with the reference by (1) simple species-by-species analysis based on frequencies in both data sets, and by (2) ordination, where releves of the restored sites were projected into a multivariate space defined by the species' abundances in the reference releves. Results: Out of the 37 species that are common (i.e. have a frequency >5%) in either the Grie NLR data or the reference data, 31 have frequencies that differ by less than a factor of five, and 23 differ by less than a factor of two. Furthermore, the Grie NLR data occupy a space that is well in the centre of the ordination space defined by the reference data. Conclusions: There are no conspicuous differences between salt-marsh vegetation behind low dams and the vegetation that has naturally developed on unprotected mudflats. We conclude that measures targeting salt marsh development in view of flood protection do not interfere with nature conservation.

AB  - Protecting coastal communities has become increasingly important as their populations grow, resulting in increased demand for engineered shore protection and hardening of over 50% of many urban shorelines. Shoreline hardening is recognized to reduce ecosystem services that coastal populations rely on, but the amount of hardened coastline continues to grow in many ecologically important coastal regions. Therefore, to inform future management decisions, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing the ecosystem services of biodiversity (richness or diversity) and habitat provisioning (organism abundance) along shorelines with versus without engineered-shore structures. Seawalls supported 23% lower biodiversity and 45% fewer organisms than natural shorelines. In contrast, biodiversity and abundance supported by riprap or breakwater shorelines were not different from natural shorelines; however, effect sizes were highly heterogeneous across organism groups and studies. As coastal development increases, the type and location of shoreline hardening could greatly affect the habitat value and functioning of nearshore ecosystems.

AB  - Populations of the European flat oyster Ostrea edulis have experienced catastrophic declines across Europe and subsequent spread of the non‐native species Crepidula fornicata has led to its occurrence in exceptionally high densities in some areas previously dominated by O. edulis. Spatial and temporal concurrence of C. fornicata larvae within the zooplankton community occurs throughout the O. edulis spawning season. A C. fornicata larval peak density of 374.7 ± 96.5 larvae/ml (mean ± SD) was observed in Langston Harbour sympatrically with O. edulis density of 45.7 ± 20.1 larvae/ml in early August. Overall oyster larvae contribution to the zooplankton community was higher in Portsmouth Harbour (12%) than C. fornicata contribution (9.6%), whilst the opposite occurred in Langstone (oysters, 11.7%; C. fornicata, 12%). Larval abundance is not reflected in recruitment on the seabed, owing to the conspecific substrate preference of O. edulis. Settlement of O. edulis spat was significantly greater on settlement discs covered with recently deceased oyster shells; 6.7 ± 1.2 (mean ± SE) spat/disc vs old smooth oyster shells, 2.7 ± 1.3, C. fornicata shell 1.7 ± 0.3, cemented discs 2 ± 1 or the plastic control disc 0.7 ± 0.7. Settlement substrate type matters in the presence of high benthic and larval densities of C. fornicata. The Solent has become a substrate‐limited system for O. edulis; substrate management or reef deployment is required to restore a self‐recruiting population. Finally, although C. fornicata may provide functional equivalence in terms of filtering services, it supports a significantly different and less biodiverse faunal community from that of O. edulis. Therefore C. fornicata does not provide equivalence as an ecosystem engineer and mechanisms of ecological phase shift are occurring within areas dominated by this invasive species.

AB  - Polyethylene plastic mesh is commonly used for containing oyster shells in small-scale oyster reef restoration, but environmental and public health concerns have prompted investigations of biodegradable alternatives. Shallow (<0.5 m) and deep (~1 m) oyster reefs (~6 m2) were constructed in the Mission-Aransas Estuary, Texas, U.S.A., in March 2020 using recycled oyster shells placed into four different replicated mesh bag types: polyethylene (plastic) and three biodegradable alternatives (cellulose, cotton, and jute). Biodegradable alternatives (cellulose, cotton, and jute) all completely degraded within two months of deployment, leaving piles of loose shell, while polyethylene bags remained intact. Despite rapid degradation, the biodegradable / loose shell successfully recruited and developed larger oysters (mean of 46 mm) than on the polyethylene-bagged shell (mean of 40 mm) after seven months, although at less than half the density. Associated motile fauna density in the bagged shell was 2.4 times higher than in the loose shell after seven months at both the deep and shallow locations. Faunal community composition and diversity varied more with reef depth than by bag type. The total cost of using polyethylene bags was lower than for biodegradable alternatives (22-45% the cost of cellulose, 35-72% the cost of jute, 49-99% the cost of cotton. However, because our estimate of the environmental cost of polyethylene plastic mesh only included impacts on marine natural capital, the true cost is likely much higher. Despite higher costs, biodegradable alternatives can still be successful for use in small-scale oyster restoration events without introducing plastics into the marine environment.

AB  - Planning for sea level rise (SLR) is a complex process that involves scientific uncertainty and local and regional political tradeoffs. As part of a 6-year transdisciplinary research project in the northern Gulf of Mexico, we conducted focus groups with coastal stakeholders (natural resource managers, community planners, and environmental communicators) to gain a better understanding of their planning and adaptation activities for SLR. This paper reports on participants' perceptions about adaptation and their current adaptation activities and strategies. While stakeholders were concerned about SLR and thought adaptation had challenges, they still shared optimism and a commitment to planning. The findings identify different types of SLR adaptation initiatives in which participants were involved as well as types of perceived barriers to adaptation planning, and major recommended strategies to address them. The paper concludes with a discussion of findings, connections to related SLR adaptation literature, practical implications for coastal resiliency, and directions for future research.

AB  - Patches of vegetation in natural water bodies grow close to each other and may affect each other’s wake pattern with significant implications on nutrient uptake and local sediment transport. This experimental study analyzed the wakes of two neighboring circular patches of emergent artificial vegetation with different densities, with the tested solid volume fractions being equal to 0.059, 0.114, and 0.188. The neighboring patches were positioned in two different configurations, namely side-by-side ( $$L/D=0$$ and $$T/D=1.5$$ ) and staggered ( $$L/D=3.5$$ and $$T/D=1.5$$ ) configurations, with D, L, and T denoting the patch diameter, the patches center-to-center longitudinal distance, and the patches center-to-center transverse distance, respectively. Results show that neighboring patches with different densities generated two distinctly different wakes at the near downstream while after 7–10D these two wakes started merging into one. The flow immediately downstream of a patch was not significantly affected by the presence of a neighboring patch and remained similar to that of an isolated patch, besides the wake of the upstream patch in staggered configuration, which was significantly affected by the downstream patch. The solid volume fraction of the neighboring patch determined the flow velocity and turbulence intensity in between the patches, which were much different compared to measurements at the side of an isolated patch.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) involves recording the sounds of animals and environments for research and conservation. PAM is used in a range of contexts across terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments. However, financial constraints limit applications within aquatic environments; these costs include the high cost of submersible acoustic recorders. We quantify this financial constraint using a systematic literature review of all ecoacoustic studies published in 2020, demonstrating that commercially available autonomous underwater recording units are, on average, five times more expensive than their terrestrial equivalents. This pattern is more extreme at the low end of the price range; the cheapest available aquatic autonomous units are over 40 times more expensive than their terrestrial counterparts. Following this, we test a prototype low-cost, low-specification aquatic recorder called the ‘HydroMoth’: this device is a modified version of a widely used terrestrial recorder (AudioMoth), altered to include a waterproof case and customisable gain settings suitable for a range of aquatic applications. We test the performance of the HydroMoth in both aquaria and field conditions, recording artificial and natural sounds, and comparing outputs with identical recordings taken with commercially available hydrophones. Although the signal-to-noise ratio and the recording quality of HydroMoths are lower than commercially available hydrophones, the recordings with HydroMoths still allow for the identification of different fish and marine mammal species, as well as the calculation of ecoacoustic indices for ecosystem monitoring. Finally, we outline the potential applications of low-cost, low-specification underwater sound recorders for bioacoustic studies, discuss their likely limitations, and present important considerations of which users should be aware. Several performance limitations and a lack of professional technical support mean that low-cost devices cannot meet the requirements of all PAM applications. Despite these limitations, however, HydroMoth facilitates underwater recording at a fraction of the price of existing hydrophones, creating exciting potential for diverse involvement in aquatic bioacoustics worldwide.

AB  - Pantropical degradation of coral reefs is prompting considerable investment in their active restoration. However, current measures of restoration success are based largely on coral cover, which does not fully reflect ecosystem function or reef health. Soundscapes are an important aspect of reef health; loud and diverse soundscapes guide the recruitment of reef organisms, but this process is compromised when degradation denudes soundscapes. As such, acoustic recovery is a functionally important component of ecosystem recovery. Here, we use acoustic recordings taken at one of the world's largest coral reef restoration projects to test whether successful restoration of benthic and fish communities is accompanied by a restored soundscape. We analyse recordings taken simultaneously on healthy, degraded (extensive historic blast fishing) and restored reefs (restoration carried out for 1–3 years on previously degraded reefs). We compare soundscapes using manual counts of biotic sounds (phonic richness), and two commonly used computational analyses (acoustic complexity index [ACI] and sound-pressure level [SPL]). Healthy and restored reef soundscapes exhibited a similar diversity of biotic sounds (phonic richness), which was significantly higher than degraded reef soundscapes. This pattern was replicated in some automated analyses but not others; the ACI exhibited the same qualitative result as phonic richness in a low-frequency, but not a high-frequency bandwidth, and there was no significant difference between SPL values in either frequency bandwidth. Furthermore, the low-frequency ACI and phonic richness scores were only weakly correlated despite showing a qualitatively equivalent overall result, suggesting that these metrics are likely to be driven by different aspects of the reef soundscape. Synthesis and applications. These data show that coral restoration can lead to soundscape recovery, demonstrating the return of an important ecosystem function. They also suggest that passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) might provide functionally important measures of ecosystem-level recovery—but only some PAM metrics reflect ecological status, and those that did are likely to be driven by different communities of soniferous animals. Recording soundscapes represents a potentially valuable tool for evaluating restoration success across ecosystems, but caution must be exercised when choosing metrics and interpreting results.

AB  - Pacific oysters are now one of the most ‘globalised’ marine invertebrates. They dominate bivalve aquaculture production in many regions and wild populations are increasingly becoming established, with potential to displace native species and modify habitats and ecosystems. While some fishing communities may benefit from wild populations, there is now a tension between the continued production of Pacific oysters and risk to biodiversity, which is of particular concern within protected sites. The issue of the Pacific oyster therefore locates at the intersection between two policy areas: one concerning the conservation of protected habitats, the other relating to livelihoods and the socio-economics of coastal aquaculture and fishing communities. To help provide an informed basis for management decisions, we first summarise evidence for ecological impacts of wild Pacific oysters in representative coastal habitats. At local scales, it is clear that establishment of Pacific oysters can significantly alter diversity, community structure and ecosystem processes, with effects varying among habitats and locations and with the density of oysters. Less evidence is available to evaluate regional-scale impacts. A range of management measures have been applied to mitigate negative impacts of wild Pacific oysters and we develop recommendations which are consistent with the scientific evidence and believe compatible with multiple interests. We conclude that all stakeholders must engage in regional decision making to help minimise negative environmental impacts, and promote sustainable industry development.

AB  - Oysters support an economically important fishery in many locations in the United States and provide benefits to the surrounding environment by filtering water, providing habitat for fish, and stabilizing shorelines. Changes in oyster reef health reflect variations in factors such as recreational and commercial harvests, predation, disease, storms, and broader anthropogenic influences, such as climate change. Consistent measurements of reef area and morphology can help effectively monitor oyster habitat across locations. However, traditional approaches to acquiring these data are time-consuming and can be costly. Unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) present a rapid and reliable method for assessing oyster habitat that may overcome these limitations, although little information on the accuracy of platforms and processing techniques is available. In the present study, oyster reefs ranging in size from 30 m2 to 300 m2 were surveyed using both fixed-wing and multirotor UAS and compared with ground-based surveys of each reef conducted with a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS). Survey images from UAS were processed using structure from motion (SfM) stereo photogrammetry techniques, with and without the use of ground control point (GCP) correction, to create reef-scale measures of area and morphology for comparison to ground-based measures. UAS-based estimates of both reef area and morphology were consistently lower than ground-based estimates, and the results of matched pairs analyses revealed that differences in reef area did not vary significantly by aircraft or the use of GCPs. However, the use of GCPs increased the accuracy of UAS-based reef morphology measurements, particularly in areas with the presence of water and/or homogeneous spectral characteristics. Our results indicate that both fixed-wing and multirotor UAS can be used to accurately monitor intertidal oyster reefs over time and that proper ground control techniques will improve measurements of reef morphology. These non-destructive methods help modernize oyster habitat monitoring by providing useful and accurate knowledge about the structure and health of oyster reefs ecosystems.

AB  - Oyster restoration practitioners augment habitat with hard substrata to increase oyster recruitment, but success can be complicated by non-indigenous species recruitment and physical processes such as sedimentation. From June 2012 to June 2014, we examined changes in shell cover and recruitment of native Ostrea lurida and non-indigenous, global invader Crassostrea gigas onto a constructed oyster bed in Alamitos Bay, CA, USA relative to an un-augmented control mudflat. Due to 72% shell loss after 1 year and informed by a concurrent study on elevational distributions of both oyster species, we augmented the oyster bed with additional shell on the lower-elevation, seaward side. One year later, O. lurida densities were significantly greater on the lower-elevation bed relative to the control and 19.4 times greater than reference populations throughout Alamitos Bay. Crassostrea gigas recruited in densities equivalent to reference populations. Adaptively restoring the bed via shell additions at a lower elevation achieved higher shell retention, increased O. lurida densities, and increased the ratio of native versus non-indigenous oysters. Our increased understanding about the role of tidal elevation in targeted restoration success of a native relative to a non-indigenous oyster species will inform future restoration designs.

AB  - Oyster reefs provide valuable ecosystem services that contribute to coastal resilience. Unfortunately, many reefs have been degraded or removed completely, and there are increased efforts to restore oysters in many coastal areas. In particular, much attention has recently been given to the restoration of shellfish reefs along eroding shorelines to reduce erosion. Such fringing reef approaches, however, often lack empirical data to identify locations where reefs are most effective in reducing marsh erosion, or fully take into account habitat suitability. Using monitoring data from 5 separate fringing reef projects across coastal Louisiana, we quantify shoreline exposure (fetch + wind direction + wind speed) and reef impacts on shoreline retreat. Our results indicate that fringing oyster reefs have a higher impact on shoreline retreat at higher exposure shorelines. At higher exposures, fringing reefs reduced marsh edge erosion an average of 1.0 m y(-1). Using these data, we identify ranges of shoreline exposure values where oyster reefs are most effective at reducing marsh edge erosion and apply this knowledge to a case study within one Louisiana estuary. In Breton Sound estuary, we calculate shoreline exposure at 500 random points and then overlay a habitat suitability index for oysters. This method and the resulting visualization show areas most likely to support sustainable oyster populations as well as significantly reduce shoreline erosion. Our results demonstrate how site selection criteria, which include shoreline exposure and habitat suitability, are critical to ensuring greater positive impacts and longevity of oyster reef restoration projects.

AB  - Oyster reefs provide habitat for numerous fish and decapod crustacean species that mediate ecosystem functioning and support vibrant fisheries. Recent focus on the restoration of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs stems from this role as a critical ecosystem engineer. Within the shallow estuaries of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM), the eastern oyster is the dominant reef building organism. This study synthesizes data on fish and decapod crustacean occupancy of oyster reefs across nGoM with the goal of providing management and restoration benchmarks, something that is currently lacking for the region. Relevant data from 23 studies were identified, representing data from all five U.S. nGoM states over the last 28 years. Cumulatively, these studies documented over 120,000 individuals from 115 fish and 41 decapod crustacean species. Densities as high as 2800 ind m-2 were reported, with individual reef assemblages composed of as many as 52 species. Small, cryptic organisms that occupy interstitial spaces within the reefs, and sampled using trays, were found at an average density of 647 and 20 ind m-2 for decapod crustaceans (range: 18 - 2843) and fishes (range: 2 - 56), respectively. Both groups of organisms were comprised, on average, of 8 species (range: 3 - 15). Larger-bodied fishes captured adjacent to the reef using gill nets were found at an average density of 6 ind m-2 (range: 1- 68) which came from 23 species (range: 9 - 46). Decapod crustaceans sampled with gill nets had a much lower average density, < 1 ind m-2, and only contained 2 species. On average, seines captured the greatest number of fish species (n = 33), which were made up of both facultative residents and transients. These data provide general gear-specific benchmarks, based on values currently found in the region, to assist managers in assessing nekton occupancy of oyster reefs, and assessing trends or changes in status of oyster reef associated nekton support. More explicit reef descriptions (e.g., rugosity, height, area, adjacent habitat) would allow for more precise benchmarks as these factors are important in determining nekton assemblages, and sampling efficiency.

AB  - Oyster reefs host complex food webs, as their three-dimensional biogenic structure provides habitat for a diverse range of invertebrates and fish. Oyster reefs have suffered severe degradation due to anthropogenic activities. Restoration projects aim to mitigate this habitat loss. We compared the development of a restored subtidal oyster reef to that of a natural reef for 29 months by assessing (1) community metrics (e.g., biomass, diversity), (2) the stable isotope composition of food sources and consumers, and (3) biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices. A clear shift in restored reef community composition occurred 12–15 months after restoration, moving from a community dominated by opportunistic species to a more diverse and evenly distributed community, similar to that of the natural reef. Consumer stable isotope values indicated that the restored reef community was supported by similar food resources and had similar food chain length as the natural reef community by 5-month post-restoration. However, biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices indicated that the magnitude of the main trophic pathways and characteristics of food web complexity in the restored reef did not recover to natural reef levels until 12–15 months after construction. The functional recovery of the restored reef community was driven by the homogenization of biomass distribution among trophic compartments as oysters and top predators increasingly colonized the reef. Results indicate that oyster reef restoration can support food web functions like those provided by natural reefs. We also demonstrate the importance of combining food web and community structure information in the study of ecological functioning.

AB  - Oyster reefs have the potential as eco-engineers to improve coastal protection. A field experiment was undertaken to assess the benefit of oyster breakwater reefs to mitigate shoreline erosion in a monsoon-dominated subtropical system. Three breakwater reefs with recruited oysters were deployed on an eroding intertidal mudflat at Kutubdia Island, the southeast Bangladesh coast. Data were collected on wave dissipation by the reef structures, changes in shoreline profile, erosion-accretion patterns, and lateral saltmarsh movement and related growth. This was done over four seasons, including the rainy monsoon period. The observed wave heights in the study area ranged 0.1–0.5 m. The reefs were able to dissipate wave energy and act as breakwaters for tidal water levels between 0.5–1.0 m. Waves were totally blocked by the vertical relief of the reefs at water levels <0.5 m. On the lee side of the reefs, there was accretion of 29 cm clayey sediments with erosion reduction of 54% as compared to control sites. The changes caused by the deployed reefs also facilitated seaward expansion of the salt marsh. This study showed that breakwater oyster reefs can reduce erosion, trap suspended sediment, and support seaward saltmarsh expansion demonstrating the potential as a nature-based solution for protecting the subtropical coastlines.

AB  - Oyster reefs have an equivalent, complex 3-dimensional structure to vegetated habitats and may provide similar functions in estuarine environments. Nevertheless, few studies have compared oyster reefs with adjacent natural shallow-water habitats. Here the resident benthic macroinvertebrate communities in an artificial oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) reef and in adjacent natural estuarine shallow-water habitats (salt marsh, intertidal mudflat, and subtidal soft bottom) in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary were described. The mean total densities and biomass, Margalef’s species richness, Pielou’s evenness and Shannon-Weaver biodiversity indices of the resident benthic macroinvertebrate communities differed significantly among the habitats. Significantly higher densities and biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates occurred in the oyster reef compared with the other three habitats. Ordination plots showed a clear separation in benthic macroinvertebrate communities among the four habitat types. The results demonstrated that the artificial oyster reef supported distinct and unique benthic communities, playing an important role in the complex estuarine habitat by supplying prey resources and contributing to biodiversity. In addition, the results suggested that the oyster reef had been restored successfully.

AB  - Oyster reefs and seagrass beds are being lost worldwide at alarming rates. These habitats provide many services to humankind and, thus, much effort has been dedicated to their restoration. Here, we examine the efficacy of created oyster reefs at enhancing seagrass beds through the amelioration of hydrographic conditions and water quality. We carried out a field experiment in the Northern Gulf of Mexico where we compared areas shoreward of created reefs with adjacent reef-free areas over several years using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design. The reefs were built with oyster shell, measured 65 m, and were placed at circa 100 m from the shoreline to ensure subtidal conditions and enhance oyster recruitment. The BACI results showed few and disparate effects of the reefs, even when distance from the reef was factored in. However, we found a temporal increase in seagrass cover throughout all the experimental area (i.e. including both reef and control plots) following reef deployment. Interestingly, further analysis with satellite imagery showed the experimental area had higher seagrass cover 5 years after reef deployment than it did before reef deployment, but such increase was not observed for nearby areas. In concert, the results suggest “shadow” effects for the reefs examined, where positive effects on seagrass beds extend beyond the area directly shoreward from the reef. Oyster reef restoration may have positive impacts on shallow seagrass beds in turbid, high-energy systems; however, more work on the extent and mechanisms for this interaction is needed.

AB  - Oyster reefs (OR) once dominated coastal estuaries but are now one of the most severely impacted marine habitats on Earth. There is little information available regarding the status of natural OR in China. This study examined the seasonal and temporal changes in the Kumamoto oyster Crassostrea sikamea population and associated benthic macrofaunal communities at the largest intertidal OR (Liyashan) of the China Sea in four field surveys (spring and fall in 2013 and 2018). The oyster densities exhibited no evident seasonal variations in either 2013 or 2018 but showed significant temporal changes and declined by 89.66% in spring and 96.27% in fall between 2013 and 2018. The total densities of benthic macrofaunal communities at the reef area of the OR were significantly higher than those at the degraded oyster habitat (DOH) and dramatically decreased by 80.73% in spring and 64.87% in fall between 2013 and 2018. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination indicated the benthic macrofaunal communities differed significantly between the OR and DOH or among the four sampling periods. Analysis of similarity indicated that the benthic communities at the OR had greater seasonal and temporal changes than did those at the DOH, and that temporal changes in benthic communities were greater than seasonal changes at each habitat. The study concluded that the OR had decreased habitat values as the oyster populations and the benthic macrofaunal communities dramatically declined from 2013 to 2018.

AB  - Oyster reef restoration projects are increasing in number both to enhance oyster density and to retain valuable ecosystem services provided by oyster reefs. Although some oyster restoration projects have demonstrated success by increasing density and biomass of transient fish, it still remains a challenge to quantify the effects of oyster restoration on transient fish communities. We developed a bioenergetics model to assess the impact of selected oyster reef restoration scenarios on associated transient fish species. We used the model to analyze the impact of changes in (1) oyster population carrying capacity; (2) oyster population growth rate; and (3) diet preference of transient fish on oyster reef development and associated transient fish species. Our model results indicate that resident fish biomass is directly affected by oyster restoration and oyster biomass, and oyster restoration can have cascading impacts on transient fish biomass. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of a favorable oyster population growth rate during early restoration years, as it can lead to rapid increases in mean oyster biomass and biomass of transient fish species. The model also revealed that a transient fish's diet solely dependent on oyster reef-derived prey could limit the biomass of transient fish species, emphasizing the importance of habitat connectivity in estuarine areas to enhance transient fish species biomass. Simple bioenergetics models can be developed to understand the dynamics of a system and make qualitative predictions of management and restoration scenarios.

AB  - Oyster reef restoration is increasingly used as a tool for restoring lost ecosystem services in degraded aquatic systems, but questions remain about the efficacy of the practice and when/if restored reefs may behave similarly to intact natural reefs. In this case study, field observations highlighted short- (<1 month post-restoration) and longer-term (30 months; 3 recruitment cycles) transformations in canopy, hydrodynamic, and biogeochemical characteristics of a restored intertidal oyster reef relative to nearby intact and degraded reefs. Within 12 months of restoration, live oyster density (326 oysters/m(2)), mean shell length (47 mm), and mean canopy height (76 mm) did not differ significantly from those observed on a reference reef. Lowering of the reef crest during restoration reestablished over-reef flow and periodic tidal inundation, improving hydraulic connectivity between the channel and the reef surface. This immediately restored much of the reef's hydrodynamic function and eliminated the irregular flow patterns observed on the previously degraded reef. Results showed that mean flow (channel-to-reef flow attenuation: 98% / 62%; within/above canopy) and velocity normalized turbulence (w('2) /U(2): 10(-1)/10(-2); ϵ/U(3): 10(0)/10(-2) m(-1)) characteristics were similar across the restored and reference reefs within 1 year of restoration, with temporal changes in mixing within the canopy attributed to increases in live oyster density. Nutrient pools (mean total carbon, total nitrogen) on reference and restored reefs had similar magnitudes within 1 year (C: 39 & 33 g/kg, N: 1.5 & 1.8 g/kg), while increases in DOC and NH(4)(+) were correlated with the presence of live oysters. Most changes that occurred on the restored reef were linked to oyster recruitment and canopy growth, which modulated hydrodynamics through direct flow interactions and controlled sediment nutrient and organic matter content through waste deposition and burial.

AB  - Oyster reef restoration in shallow estuarine environments has been thought to have the potential to provide shoreline protection as well as oyster habitat. This study was designed to address the question of how effective oyster reefs are at attenuating wave energy in shallow coastal bays. Measurements were made of waves on both sides of four restored intertidal oyster reefs and at a control site with no reef; mean water depths ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 m. The reefs differed in composition and position relative to the shoreline, but all had reef crest elevations between 0.3 and 0.5 m below mean sea level. Differences in wave heights between the exposed/sheltered sides and upwind/downwind sides of the reefs were used to quantify the effects of the reefs on waves under varying tidal and wind conditions. All four reefs were able to reduce wave heights by an average of 30–50% for water depths of 0.5–1.0 m (bracketing the heights of reef crests) and 0–20% for water depths of 1.0–1.5 m (reef crests > 0.25 m below the water surface). For water depths greater than 1.5 m, there was < 10% change in wave heights. In contrast, there was no average decrease in wave height from the more seaward (exposed) to the more landward wave gauge at the control site regardless of water depth. Based on our results, we conclude that fringing oyster reefs can reduce the wave energy reaching the shoreline of marshes with edge elevations close to mean sea level. However, reefs like those in our study have little effect on waves during deeper water conditions, which allow for the largest waves, and are therefore less likely to offer protection to marshes characterized by high edge scarps and marsh surface elevations well above mean sea level.

AB  - Oyster reef restoration has become a principal strategy for ameliorating the loss of natural Crassostrea virginica populations and increasing habitat provision. In 2014, a large‐scale, high‐relief, 23‐ha subtidal C. virginica reef was restored at the historically productive Half Moon Reef in Matagorda Bay, TX, using concrete and limestone substrates. Encrusting and motile fauna were sampled seasonally until 17 months postrestoration at the restored reef and at adjacent unrestored sites. Restored oysters developed rapidly and were most abundant 3 months postrestoration, with subsequent declines possibly due to interacting effects of larval settlement success on new substrate versus post‐settlement mortality due to competitors and predators. Oyster densities were 2× higher than in a restored oyster population in Chesapeake Bay that was reported to be the largest reestablished metapopulation of native oysters in the world. Resident fauna on the restored reef were 62% more diverse, had 433% greater biomass, and comprised a distinct faunal community compared to unrestored sites. The presence of three‐dimensional habitat was the most important factor determining resident faunal community composition, indicating that substrate limitation is a major hindrance for oyster reef community success in Texas and other parts of the Gulf of Mexico. There were only minor differences in density, biomass, and diversity of associated fauna located adjacent (13 m) versus distant (150 m) to the restored reef. The two substrate types compared had little influence on oyster recruitment or faunal habitat provision. Results support the use of reef restoration as a productive means to rebuild habitat and facilitate faunal enhancement.

This study investigated the efficacy of a biodegradable plastic-alternative, BESE-elements®, in supporting oyster reef restoration in east-central Florida (USA) with consideration for how this material also influences biogeochemistry. Four experiments (two laboratory, two field-based) were conducted to evaluate the ability of BESE to serve as a microbial substrate, release nutrients, support oyster recruitment and the development of sediment biogeochemical properties on restored reefs, and degrade under field conditions. The results indicated BESE is as successful as traditional plastic in supporting initial reef development. In the lab, BESE accelerated short-term (10-day) sediment respiration rates 14-fold and released dissolved organic carbon, soluble reactive phosphorus, and nitrate to the surface water (71,156, 1980, and 87% increase, respectively) relative to without BESE, but these effects did not translate into measurable changes in reef sediment nutrient pools under field conditions. BESE lost 7–12% mass in the first year, resulting in a half-life of 4.4–6.7 years. Restoration practitioners should evaluate the biogeochemical properties of biodegradable materials prior to large-scale deployment and consider the fate of the restoration effort once the material degrades.

AB  - Oyster reef living shorelines have been proposed as an effective alternative to traditional coastal defence structures (e.g. bulkheads, breakwaters), with the benefit that they may keep pace with sea‐level rise and provide co‐benefits, such as habitat provision. However, there remains uncertainty about the effectiveness of shoreline protection provided by oyster reefs, which limits their broader application. We draw evidence from studies along the east and gulf coasts of the United States, where much research and implementation of oyster reef restoration has occurred, to better define the existing gaps in our understanding of the use of restored oyster reefs for shoreline protection. We find potential disconnects between ecological and engineering functions of reefs. In response, we outline how engineering and ecological principles are used in the design of oyster reef living shorelines and highlight knowledge gaps where an integration of these disciplines will lead to their more effective application. Synthesis and applications. This work highlights the necessary steps to advance the application of oyster reef living shorelines. Importantly, future research should focus on appropriate designs and conditions needed for these structures to effectively protect our coasts from erosion, while supporting a sustainable oyster population, thereby providing actionable nature‐based alternatives for coastal defence to diverse end‐users.

AB  - Oyster populations and reef habitats have notably declined in the last century around the world. The ecological, economic, and cultural values of oysters have led to a variety of restoration efforts seeking to recover these lost benefits. Limitations of the native oyster shell substrate and the large-scale nature of many restoration projects have resulted in the increased use of a variety of alternative, or artificial, substrates to create reef structures. A text mining package was used to conduct a review of alternative substrates used for oyster restoration. Specifically, the review (1) assessed commonly used alternative substrates, (2) locations where alternative substrates are used, and (3) common performance metrics used to evaluate alternative substrates. The review demonstrated that (1) the most common substrates included porcelain, concrete, limestone, noncalcium stone, nonoyster shell, dredged shell, and engineered reefs; (2) oyster restoration with alternative substrates occurs worldwide, but evaluations of alternative substrates were primarily (79%) within the United States of America; and (3) four main categories of performance metrics are used to assess alternative substrates—biological, structural, chemical, and economic acceptability. Within the four performance metrics, however, there exists a substantial variety in terms of specific metrics used and application of metrics to assess alternative substrates. Results highlight the need for common metrics across projects to ease comparison between alternative substrate options.

AB  - Oyster habitat restoration seeks to recover lost ecosystem services including increased provisioning of refuge and foraging habitat for fish and invertebrate communities. The goal of this study was to quantify the ecosystem service benefit of habitat provisioning in Ninigret Pond, RI, following oyster restoration. Four metrics were measured, abundance, biomass, species richness, and diversity, as well as isotopic composition in fish and invertebrates collected seasonally from restored oyster, aquaculture, and bare sediment sites, to examine whether the oyster habitat outperformed the bare sediment habitat. Sampling locations were chosen in Foster's Cove north and south, Grassy Point, South Sanctuary, and an Aquaculture lease; each had two restored oyster sites and one bare sediment site. Each site was sampled using a box trap, seine net, shrimp trap, and minnow trap. Oyster habitats had significantly greater metrics than did bare sediment habitats in some comparisons from the box trap and seine net samples. Restored oyster sites at South Sanctuary had lower metric values than the other oyster sites. Metrics from the Aquaculture sites were comparable to the Foster's Cove and Grassy Point restored oyster sites and often outperformed South Sanctuaryrestored oyster sites. Seasonally, spring and autumn samples tended to have higher abundance and biomass values than summer samples. Isotopic composition of five species occurring at both restored oyster and bare sediment sites demonstrated some differences in the trophic levels between species but not between habitat types. In Ninigret Pond, fish and invertebrate abundance, biomass, species richness, and diversity benefit from the use of oyster and bare sediment habitats. Coastal zone managers interested in restoring the ecological function of oyster reefs to support fish and invertebrate communities should consider strategically locating restoration projects within the mosaic of structured habitats and monitoring them for selected ecosystem services.

AB  - Owing to threats to coral reefs due to anthropogenic climate change and other factors, this study aims to clarify the effective development of coral reef management in the waters around Japan by exploring the reasons why people have not participated in coral reef management and identifying the barriers to participation. This study focused on the sentiment of ``regret,'' which was mentioned as a key exemplified factor for behavior modification in previous studies. Herein, data acquired by a web investigation was used for analysis, and two working hypotheses were verified. The first hypothesis was that ``Subjective assessment of the existential value of coral reefs is statistically significantly correlated with feelings of regret expressed in the face of steady bleaching and death.''. The second hypothesis is that ``People who have many intrinsic and extrinsic reasons for not participating in coral reef management activities do not regret confronting such serious situations''. As a result of the analysis, Hypothesis 1 was accepted and Hypothesis 2 was partially conditionally accepted. These results suggest the following implementation of the obtained knowledge into practice. That is, many respondents did not participate in management activities that did not have clear objectives, despite regrets based on information on past coral reef degradation; increasing the number of participants by addressing their feelings of regret is not easy. In contrast, manageable administration and accessibility of specialists that offer opportunities for participation in coral reef management are effective solutions for latent citizen participation and facilitate appropriate technical guidance.

AB  - Overfishing, nutrient-fuelled hypoxia and habitat destruction have reduced oyster populations to a fraction of their former abundance. Over the past two decades there has been a widespread effort to restore oyster reefs and develop oyster aquaculture. Yet it remains unclear how re-introduction of large oyster populations will change coastal biogeochemistry. Of particular interest is whether oysters may help offset excess nitrogen loading, which is responsible for widespread coastal water quality degradation, low oxygen conditions and biodiversity declines. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to assess how oysters alter inorganic nutrient cycling, with a focus on nitrogen removal. Additionally, we examined how oysters alter greenhouse gas emissions. We demonstrate that oysters enhance removal of excess nitrogen by stimulating denitrification, promote efficient nutrient recycling and may have a negligible greenhouse gas footprint. Further, oyster reefs and oyster aquaculture appear to have similar biogeochemical function, suggesting the potential for sustainable production of animal protein alongside environmental restoration. Oysters clean nutrient-polluted waters, but their populations have crashed. This study synthesizes research on oyster impacts and finds that they help remove excess nitrogen and promote nutrient recycling without contributing greatly to greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Overfishing and pollution have led to marine habitat degradation, and as a result, marine fisheries are now in decline. Consequently, there is a real need to enhance marine ecosystems while halting the decline of fish stocks and boosting artisanal fishing. Under these circumstances, artificial reefs (ARs) have emerged as a promising option. Nevertheless, their performance is traditionally assessed years after installation, through experimental and field observations. It is now necessary to adopt an alternative approach, adapting the design of artificial reefs to the specific characteristics of the ecosystem to be enhanced. In this way, it will be possible to determine the potential positive impacts of ARs before their installation. This paper presents a general and integrated conceptual framework to assist in the design of AR units by adopting an ecosystem ecology (EE) perspective. It consists of three main parts. In the first one, starting from an initial geometry, EE principles are used to include modifications with the aim of improving autotrophic resource pathways (additional substrata and increased nutrient circulation) and leading to a habitat enhancement (more shelter for individuals). The second part of the framework is a new dimensionless index that allows the user to select the best AR unit design from different alternatives. The potential impacts on the ecosystem in terms of energy, nutrient cycling and shelter are considered for such a purpose. Finally, a general hydrodynamic methodology to study the stability of the selected AR unit design, considering the effect of high waves under severe storms, is proposed. The framework is applied through a case study for Galician estuaries.

AB  - Over the past decade, the scientific community has studied, experimented, and published a notable body of literature on the ecological enhancement of coastal and marine infrastructure (CMI). The Nature-Inclusive Design (NID) approach refers to methods and technologies that can be integrated into the design and construction of CMI to create a suitable habitat for native species (or communities) whose natural habitat has been degraded or reduced. To examine the compliance of new environmentally sensitive technologies with structural requirements and fiscal restraints, while providing ecosystem and habitat value, this paper presents the findings of a structural-economical-biological analysis of ecologically engineered Articulated Concrete Block Mattresses (ACBMs). To evaluate the structural and biological performance of the Ecological Articulated Concrete Block Mattresses, a pilot project was deployed in April 2017 at Port Everglades, Florida, USA, and evaluated against controls of adjacent artificial structures and smooth-surface concrete blocks and monitored over a period of two years. The elements of ecological enhancement implemented in the fabrication and design of the ecologically enhanced ACBMs were comprised of bio-enhancing concrete additives and science-based designs. Based on the results of this study, these design alterations have increased the richness and diversity of sessile assemblages compared to control blocks and adjacent artificial structures and supported a higher abundance of mobile species. This ecological improvement was achieved within the operational limitations of conventional manufacturing and installation technologies, while complying with strict structural requirements for standard concrete marine construction. The results supported the working hypothesis and demonstrated that modifications of concrete composition, surface texture, and macro-design have the potential to increase the ecological value of concrete-based CMI and promote a more sustainable and adaptive approach to coastal and marine development in an era of climate resilience-building.

AB  - Over the past decade, coastal communities and ecosystems in the Northeast United States have begun to face acute and chronic impacts of climate change. Extreme events such as Superstorm Sandy caused stakeholders in this region to examine what information is needed to implement adaptation and mitigation plans to prepare for the next major storm. The objective of this study was to determine research needs identified by stakeholders in the Northeast needed for decision-support and policy creation so that scientists can target future research efforts to fill gaps. Modeled after document analysis methods in Dilling et al. (2014), this study examines documents sourced from local and regional organizations in both the public and private sectors to determine gaps in information necessary for climate resilience planning. Stakeholders throughout the Northeast expressed a need for solution-based research, in particular natural and nature-based solutions such as wetlands. Additionally, there was a need to better understand the economic impacts of climate change on key industries in the region as well as cost-benefit analyses of different adaptation options. It was also determined that government organizations, such as Sea Grant, play a crucial role in supporting stakeholder needs assessments both in terms of funding and providing necessary expertise. This study provides a baseline of stakeholder-expressed research needs in the Northeast to start the conversation between communities and researchers interested in conducting useable science.

AB  - Over the last century, human activities have increased the amount of nutrients inputs to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These activities have altered nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, causing substantial changes in ecosystem function such as provision of clean air and water. Strategies that reduce and remove excess nutrients are urgently needed to remediate impacted systems. Reef-forming shellfish (oysters and mussels) can play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, particularly in N removal from aquatic systems by providing substrate for microbial colonisation and enhancing microbial denitrification in the surrounding sediments. However, the potential for shellfish to enhance nutrient cycling (and denitrification) will likely vary spatially and in response to several environmental factors. Here, we used 1) a qualitative analysis to review nutrient processes occurring on shellfish; and 2) a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of shellfish on benthic metabolism and nutrient cycling in surrounding sediments, and how that is influenced by environmental factors such as grain size, seasonality, water body type, and tidal position. Overall, we found that shellfish increased oxygen consumption, with consequent release of ammonia (NH(4(+))) and phosphate (PO(4)(3)(-)) from shellfish and their surrounding sediments. These parameters did not depend on grain size, water body type and tidal height, but the release of PO(4)(3)(-) was variable between seasons, being highest during summer and autumn. Shellfish presence also enhanced denitrification measured as dinitrogen gas (N(2)) efflux on both reefs and sediments. Denitrification was highest in lagoons; in sandy sediments; and during the warmest season (summer). Thus, our findings highlight that environmental context can mediate the effects of shellfish reefs on sediment function. This information is important for managers seeking to use these animals as an effective bioremediation tool.

AB  - Over recent years, many coastal engineering projects have employed the use of soft solutions as these are generally less environmentally damaging than hard solutions. However, in some cases, local conditions hinder the use of soft solutions, meaning that hard solutions have to be adopted or, sometimes, a combination of hard and soft measures is seen as optimal. This research reviews the use of hard coastal structures on the foreshore (groynes, breakwaters and jetties) and onshore (seawalls and dikes). The purpose, functioning and local conditions for which these structures are most suitable are outlined. A description is provided on the negative effects that these structures may have on morphological, hydrodynamic and ecological conditions. To reduce or mitigate these negative impacts, or to create new ecosystem services, the following nature-based adaptations are proposed and discussed: (1) applying soft solutions complementary to hard solutions, (2) mitigating morphological and hydrodynamic changes and (3) ecologically enhancing hard coastal structures. The selection and also the success of these potential adaptations are highly dependent on local conditions, such as hydrodynamic forcing, spatial requirements and socioeconomic factors. The overview provided in this paper aims to offer an interdisciplinary understanding, by giving general guidance on which type of solution is suitable for given characteristics, taking into consideration all aspects that are key for environmentally sensitive coastal designs. Overall, this study aims to provide guidance at the interdisciplinary design stage of nature-based coastal defence structures.

AB  - Ostrea edulis is one of the most common types of meat oysters and is commonly consumed by people in Kuala Gigieng, but until now there is not much scientific information about this species. The purpose of this study was to describe the ecomorphology of Ostrea edulis in Kuala Gigieng waters. This research was conducted from August to September 2013 in Kuala Gigieng Waters, Aceh Besar District. The method used in this research is purposive sampling. Identification of samples based on shell morphological characteristics including the exterior and interior of the shell using a magnifier lamp. The results showed that Ostrea edulis found in Kuala Gigieng waters had round, rough, hard, thick and uneven shells. The two valves are also not the same size, where the left valve is more concave than the right valve which tends to be flat. This is a form of the adaptation pattern of Ostrea edulis in Kuala Gigieng which tends to have a medium sand and clay sand substrate with a fairly high predation from both natural and human predation.

AB  - One of the paramount goals of oyster reef living shorelines is to achieve sustained and adaptive coastal protection, which requires meeting ecological (i.e., develop a self-sustaining oyster population) and engineering (i.e., provide coastal defense) targets. In a large-scale comparison along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, the efficacy of various designs of oyster reef living shorelines at providing wave attenuation was evaluated accounting for the ecological limitations of oysters with regard to inundation duration. A critical threshold for intertidal oyster reef establishment is 50% inundation duration. Living shorelines that spent less than one-half of the time ( 50% inundation were considered suitable habitat for oysters, but wave attenuation was similar to controls (no reef; ~5% reduction in wave height). Many of the oyster reef living shoreline approaches therefore failed to optimize the ecological and engineering goals. In both inundation regimes, wave transmission decreased with an increasing freeboard (difference between reef crest elevation and water level), supporting its importance in the wave attenuation capacity of oyster reef living shorelines. However, given that the reef crest elevation (and thus freeboard) should be determined by the inundation duration requirements of oysters, research needs to be refocused on understanding the implications of other reef parameters (e.g., width) for optimizing wave attenuation. A broader understanding of the reef characteristics and seascape contexts that result in effective coastal defense by oyster reefs is needed to inform appropriate design and implementation of oyster-based living shorelines globally.

AB  - One of the most frequently quoted ecosystem services of seagrass meadows is their value for coastal protection. Many studies emphasize the role of above-ground shoots in attenuating waves, enhancing sedimentation and preventing erosion. This raises the question if short-leaved, low density (grazed) seagrass meadows with most of their biomass in belowground tissues can also stabilize sediments. We examined this by combining manipulative field experiments and wave measurements along a typical tropical reef flat where green turtles intensively graze upon the seagrass canopy. We experimentally manipulated wave energy and grazing intensity along a transect perpendicular to the beach, and compared sediment bed level change between vegetated and experimentally created bare plots at three distances from the beach. Our experiments showed that i) even the short-leaved, low-biomass and heavily-grazed seagrass vegetation reduced wave-induced sediment erosion up to threefold, and ii) that erosion was a function of location along the vegetated reef flat. Where other studies stress the importance of the seagrass canopy for shoreline protection, our study on open, low-biomass and heavily grazed seagrass beds strongly suggests that belowground biomass also has a major effect on the immobilization of sediment. These results imply that, compared to shallow unvegetated nearshore reef flats, the presence of a short, low-biomass seagrass meadow maintains a higher bed level, attenuating waves before reaching the beach and hence lowering beach erosion rates. We propose that the sole use of aboveground biomass as a proxy for valuing coastal protection services should be reconsidered.

AB  - One effect of climate change may be increased hurricane frequency or intensity due to changes in atmospheric and geoclimatic factors. It has been hypothesized that wetland restoration and infrastructure hardening measures may improve infrastructure resilience to increased hurricane frequency and intensity. This paper describes a parametric decision model used to assess the tradeoffs between wetland restoration and infrastructure hardening for electric power networks. We employ a hybrid economic input–output life-cycle analysis (EIO-LCA) model to capture: construction costs and life-cycle emissions for transitioning from the current electric power network configuration to a hardened network configuration; construction costs and life-cycle emissions associated with wetland restoration; and the intrinsic value of wetland restoration. Uncertainty is accounted for probabilistically through a Monte Carlo hurricane simulation model and parametric sensitivity analysis for the number of hurricanes expected to impact the project area during the project cycle and the rate of wetland storm surge attenuation. Our analysis robustly indicates that wetland restoration and undergrounding of electric power network infrastructure is not preferred to the “do-nothing” option of keeping all power lines overhead without wetland protection. However, we suggest a few items for future investigation. For example, our results suggest that, for the small case study developed, synergistic benefits of simultaneously hardening infrastructure and restoring wetlands may be limited, although research using a larger test bed while integrating additional costs may find an enhanced value of wetland restoration for disaster loss mitigation.

AB  - One ecological service that oyster reefs provide is stabilization of shorelines through reduced wave energy and erosion from boat traffic, storms, and predominant wind direction. Additionally, increasing sedimentation can enhance the growth of emergent marsh vegetation which further stabilizes unconsolidated sediments. A 21 mo study of constructed (with only 30-35% coverage) and natural oyster reefs in 3 bayous in the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) suggested constructed reefs benefit this retrograding deltaic ecosystem. The marsh edge adjacent to all constructed reefs was less eroded (mean = 0.043 m) than edges adjacent to natural reefs (mean = 0.728 m), although all natural and constructed sites, regardless of bayou, illustrated large variations in marsh edge growth. The marsh edge in constructed sites in one bayou retreated more than in the other bayous, most likely due to its coarser sediments, greater boat traffic, and its apparent higher energy location within the landscape. By the end of this study, the ecological function of constructed oys- ter reefs in all bayous, as measured by marsh edge erosion reduction, was equivalent or exceeded the function in nearby natural oyster reefs. The physical structure of the reef further served to reduce erosion and marsh loss and this approach may be useful for management of a retrograding deltaic estuarine ecosystem like the Grand Bay NERR.

AB  - Once viewed as an inexhaustible fishery resource, eastern oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) have been dramatically depleted. In North Carolina alone, eastern oyster harvests have declined by 90% since the early 1900s. However, eastern oyster restoration and management efforts have substantially increased since the 1970s. Oyster reefs provide habitat and refuge for organisms, improve water quality, and decrease erosion. Oyster restoration projects aim to construct reefs that function similarly to their natural counterparts. Therefore, post-creation monitoring of these reefs is crucial in determining restoration success. However, monitoring is often lacking or focused only on oyster density and size rather than ecosystem functions such as nekton utilization. This study examines nekton utilization among created reefs compared to natural reefs in an estuary in Wilmington, North Carolina. The objective was to determine whether the created reefs function similarly to the natural reefs in abundance, species richness, and fish size. Using seine nets and Breder traps, reefs were sampled over a 5-month period. No significant difference was detected among reefs for nekton abundance, species richness, and standard length. This is a promising result for future management, indicating that created and natural reefs can support similar communities of fishes and shrimp.

AB  - On October 29, 2012, Superstorm Sandy crashed into the New York Bight as a post-tropical cyclone. This storm produced extensive damage to the New Jersey and New York coastal zone. Much of the damage was caused by the storm surge that accompanied Sandy and the shifting of sand and destruction of coastal dunes. Our study was concerned with the effects that this event had on the vascular flora of the salt marshes in the impact zone. We visited six New Jersey-New York marshes in the late summer and early fall of 2013 and compared, using parsimony analysis, the current state of the vascular flora of those marshes against a pre-Sandy database. Although we observed relatively minor variations in the vascular flora at these sites, that is, the loss of some species and gains in others, overall, most plant species post-Sandy was the same as those pre-Sandy. Thus, we conclude that the species composition of the vascular flora of these salt marshes showed a remarkable degree of stability in the face of this ...

AB  - Okinawa is the largest and most populated island of the Ryukyu Archipelago in southern Japan and is renowned for its natural resources and beauty. Similar as to what has been happening in the rest of the country, Okinawa Island has been affected by an increasing amount of development and construction work. The trend has been particularly acute after reversion to Japanese sovereignty in 1972, following 27 years of post-war American administration. A coastline once characterized by extended sandy beaches surrounded by coral reefs now includes tracts delimited by seawalls, revetments, and other human-made hardening structures. Additionally, part of coastal Okinawa Island was obtained by land-filling shallow ocean areas (land reclamation). Nevertheless, the current extension of the artificial coastline, as well as the level of fragmentation of the natural coastline are unclear, due to the lack of both published studies and easily accessible and updated datasets. The aims of this research were to quantify the extension of coastline alterations in Okinawa Island, including the amount of land-filling performed over the last 41 years, and to describe the coastlines that have been altered the most as well as those that are still relatively pristine. The analyses were performed using a reference map of Okinawa Island based on GIS vector data extracted from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) coastline dataset (average node distance for Okinawa Island = 24 m), in addition to satellite and aerial photography from multiple providers. We measured 431.8 km of altered coastline, equal to about 63% of the total length of coastline in Okinawa Island. Habitat fragmentation is also an issue as the remaining natural coastline was broken into 239 distinct tracts (mean length = 1.05 km). Finally, 21.03 km2 of the island's surface were of land reclaimed over the last 41 years. The west coast has been altered the most, while the east coast is in relatively more natural conditions, particularly the northern part, which has the largest amount of uninterrupted natural coastline. Given the importance of the ecosystem services that coastal and marine ecosystems provide to local populations of subtropical islands, including significant economic income from tourism, conservation of remaining natural coastlines should be given high priority.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is the decline in seawater pH and saturation levels of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals that has led to concerns for calcifying organisms such as corals, oysters and mussels because of the adverse effects of OA on their biomineralisation, shells and skeletons. A range of cellular biology, geochemistry and materials science approaches have been used to explore biomineralisation. These techniques have revealed that responses to seawater acidification can be highly variable among species, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unresolved. To assess the impacts of global OA, researchers will need to apply a range of tools developed across disciplines, many of which are emerging and have not yet been used in this context. This review outlines techniques that could be applied to study OA-induced alterations in the mechanisms of biomineralisation and their ultimate effects on shells and skeletons. We illustrate how to characterise, quantify and monitor the process of biomineralisation in the context of global climate change and OA. We highlight the basic principles, as well as the advantages and disadvantages, of established, emerging and future techniques for OA researchers. A combination of these techniques will enable a holistic approach and better understanding of the potential impact of OA on biomineralisation and its consequences for marine calcifiers and associated ecosystems.

AB  - O_LIClimate change and coastal development pressures have intensified the need for shoreline protection. Nature-first approaches that use natural habitats, particularly marshes, are being promoted globally as ecologically-beneficial alternatives to grey infrastructure. The ability of these novel shorelines to provide nursery habitat to blue crab, an ecologically and economically important species along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, has not been quantified. C_LIO_LIWe quantified the abundance and size distribution of juvenile blue crabs from a chronosequence of living shorelines (created fringing marshes) spanning 2 to 16 years in age (since construction) and compared with paired natural fringing marshes in the southern Chesapeake Bay. C_LIO_LIBoth created and natural fringing marshes are being used by blue crabs as primary nursery habitats. While there were interannual differences in abundance, young blue crabs ([≤] 2.5 cm carapace width) were observed in similar densities and sizes at living shoreline and natural marshes. There was no relationship between the age of the living shoreline and blue crab density, indicating that even the youngest living shorelines (2 years) were providing primary nursery habitat. Young blue crabs were more abundant in more isolated marshes and those that were inundated for longer periods of time each tidal cycle, which may be evidence for habitat-limitation. C_LIO_LISynthesis and applications: We provide evidence that juvenile blue crabs are comparably using natural and created fringing salt marshes as primary nursery habitat. Although the relative importance of salt marshes as young crab nursery habitat is not fully understood and likely varies by system, the value of marshes within a suite of available structural nursery habitats may increase under a changing climate. The potential for living shorelines to serve as nursery habitat for an economically important species may provide additional incentives to implement these climate adaptation strategies. C_LI

AB  - Nutrient removal is among the most valuable ecosystem services provided by marshes and is often a stated goal of coastal restoration projects. However, the removal capacity of constructed marshes is potentially affected by several site-specific and design factors, such as marsh platform elevation, slope, sediment type, initial planting density and wave climate. Here, the main and interactive effects of these factors on the capacity of constructed marshes to remove nitrate from runoff was explored in field experiments at sites protected from and exposed to waves. At both sites, three experimental blocks were established, each with 24 treatment combinations of factors in experimental flumes: two platform elevations (high and low), two slopes (steep and shallow), two sediment types (coarse and fine grain), and three initial planting densities (0%, 50% and 100% cover). Nutrient rich (KNO3) groundwater solution was fed through the marsh rhizosphere using subsurface diffusers. The relative effects of treatment combinations were then assessed by analyzing porewater NOx concentrations with ANOVA models. None of the treatment combinations had any observable effect on porewater NOx concentrations at the exposed site. However, both sediment type and planting density were significant main effects at the protected site with the lowest NOx concentrations found in flumes with fine sediments and initially planted. These results confirm that design factors can have large implications on nutrient dynamics of constructed marshes in areas protected from waves and that wave energy can substantially reduce the influence of these design factors.

AB  - Nowadays, the development of e-health monitoring devices is getting more demand for remote health applications. In addition, cardiovascular diseases is considered the most chronic disease in recent years. So, this requires a fast diagnosis and therapy to clear this issue and requires an information transformation from the patient to the distant hospital. But, it faces many challenges like more energy consumption, data security, storage, and transmission. In addition, the electrocardiogram (ECG) data must be processed in real-time, and the information must have high predictability and lossless compression. So, in this article, an enhanced set partitioning in hierarchical tree decoder with deep belief neural network is developed for ECG compression. Due to an inappropriate channel in telemedicine applications, the ECG signals transmitted through a wireless network are affected by noise. So, fast normalized least mean square (FNLMS) algorithm based adaptive filter is deliberated to eliminate the unwanted noise from the ECG signal. Also, the structure of the FNLMs based adaptive filter is modified by developing a systolic structure to increase the speed of filtering process. Moreover, the parallel and pipelined architecture is provided for the proposed compression unit to reduce the processing time and the area overhead as compared to the existing methods. A publicly available database called the MIT-BIH database and real-time ECG data records are used for simulation purposes. The proposed design was implemented on the Xilinx platform and the MATLAB tool. The performance of the proposed design is estimated by the parameters like compression ratio, signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and percentage root mean square difference (PRD), PRD normalized, and quality-score. It is compared with existing designs to show the efficiency of our proposed design.

AB  - Nitrogen pollution is one of the primary threats to coastal water quality globally, and governmental regulations and marine policy are increasingly requiring nitrogen remediation in management programs. Traditional mitigation strategies (e.g., advanced wastewater treatment) are not always enough to meet reduction goals. Novel opportunities for additional nitrogen reduction are needed to develop a portfolio of long-term solutions. Increasingly, in situ nitrogen reduction practices are providing a complementary management approach to the traditional source control and treatment, including recognition of potential contributions of coastal bivalve shellfish. While policy interest in bivalves has focused primarily on nitrogen removal via biomass harvest, bivalves can also contribute to nitrogen removal by enhancing denitrification (the microbial driven process of bioavailable nitrogen transformation to di-nitrogen gas). Recent evidence suggests that nitrogen removed via enhanced denitrification may eclipse nitrogen removal through biomass harvest alone. With a few exceptions, bivalve-enhanced denitrification has yet to be incorporated into water quality policy. Here, we focus on oysters in considering how this issue may be addressed. We discuss policy options to support expansion of oyster-mediated denitrification, describe the practical considerations for incorporation into nitrogen management, and summarize the current state of the field in accounting for denitrification in oyster habitats. When considered against alternative nitrogen control strategies, we argue that enhanced denitrification associated with oysters should be included in a full suite of nitrogen removal strategies, but with the recognition that denitrification associated with oyster habitats will not alone solve our excess nitrogen loading problem.

AB  - Nature-based solutions, such as living shorelines, have the potential to restore critical ecosystems, enhance coastal sustainability, and increase resilience to natural disasters; however, their efficacy during storm events compared to traditional hardened shorelines is largely untested. This is a major impediment to their implementation and promotion to policy-makers and homeowners. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated rock sill living shorelines as compared to natural marshes and hardened shorelines (i.e., bulkheads) in North Carolina, USA for changes in surface elevation, Spartina alterniflora stem density, and structural damage from 2015 to 2017, including before and after Hurricane Matthew (2016). Our results show that living shorelines exhibited better resistance to landward erosion during Hurricane Matthew than bulkheads and natural marshes. Additionally, living shorelines were more resilient than hardened shorelines, as they maintained landward elevation over the two-year study period without requiring any repair. Finally, rock sill living shorelines were able to enhance S. alterniflora stem densities over time when compared to natural marshes. Our results suggest that living shorelines have the potential to improve coastal resilience while supporting important coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS), such as the implementation of environmental conservation and restoration as public works projects, require accurate and cost-effective assessments of the values related to the projects. The values should represent collective ecosystem services, individual services such as food provision and water purification, and other intangible services. To comprehensively assess such services, we proposed a novel method, which we call the comparative evaluation method. Our method is able to assess the value of each service category of an NbS project from a single questionnaire survey. Survey participants are asked to compare values of multiple services having anchoring prices. Our method determines the permissible economic value of environmental public works (PEP) in response to the quantity of service. The questionnaire results used for analysis are limited to those from respondents who made their PEP evaluation on the basis of their consideration of the appropriate expenditure of taxes. In addition, the method controls for the effect of the satisfaction that a person experiences from doing good deeds to reduce an overestimation of the values of services. Moreover, PEPs are not influenced by the respondent's annual income, age, sex, or educational background, and are based on personal values. Applying this new method, we surveyed residents of the watersheds of Tokyo Bay and Osaka Bay and evaluated nine ecosystem services. Overall, our new method is shown to be an effective method for evaluating the ecosystem services of NbS projects from the viewpoint of public works.

AB  - Nature-Based Solutions (NbS), a concept introduced in the late 2000s, has developed rapidly during the last years and is now frequently appearing in a broad spectrum of policies developed within the European Union. Its role in marine policies and research programmes is however still limited, but is likely to increase as NbS are adopted as key terminology in both biodiversity strategies and the EU taxonomy for sustainable financing. This will enhance the need for scientific advisory institutions to provide evidence-based advice on potential impacts of various combinations of marine NbS. To facilitate a critical debate about the prospects and pitfalls related to the operationalisation of marine NbS in an EU context, this paper provides an analysis of core definitions, potential categories of marine NBS and a suite of case studies. Coastal waters, shelf and open oceans present multiple options for testing new and scaling up known NbS, which could support both environmental restoration simultaneously with addressing multiple societal challenges, paving the way for a new level of ecosystem-based management. However, as the acceptance of NbS types will depend on ecosystem state and thus history, it will be a significant task to consistently communicate why some solutions may count as a NbS in some areas, while not in others. To conclude, the paper therefore raises a set of research priorities and policy advice aimed at ensuring the successful advice and deployment of marine NBS in support of multiple societal goals. • Nature-based solutions is gaining momentum globally as a concept with increases in marine scientific advise anticipated • Many opportunities for nature-based solutions in European waters to address societal challenges beyond climate change • Successful operationalization challenged in EU by elusive definitions and lack of criteria leading to a risk of greenwashing • Attention needed from European policy makers and research and innovation funding entities to address policy and knowledge gaps

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have been advocated to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The uptake of NbS differs regionally with some countries exhibiting greater uptake than others. The success of NbS also differs regionally with varying environmental conditions and social-ecological processes. In many regions, the body of knowledge, particularly around the efficacy of such efforts, remains fragmented. Having an “inventory” or “tool box” of regionally-trialed methods, outcomes and lessons learnt can improve the evidence base, inform adaptive management, and ultimately support the uptake of NbS. Using Malaysia as a case study, we provide a comprehensive overview of trialed and tested NbS efforts that used nature to address societal challenges in marine and coastal environments (here referring to mangroves, seagrass, coral reefs), and detailed these efforts according to their objectives, as well as their anticipated and actual outcomes. The NbS efforts were categorised according to the IUCN NbS approach typology and mapped to provide a spatial overview of IUCN NbS effort types. A total of 229 NbS efforts were collated, representing various levels of implementation success. From the assessment of these efforts, several key actions were identified as a way forward to enhance the uptake of Nature-based Solutions for informing coastal sustainable development policy and planning. These include increasing education, training, and knowledge sharing,; rationalizing cooperation across jurisdictions, laws, and regulations; enhancing environmental monitoring; leveraging on existing policies; enabling collaboration and communication; and implementing sustainable finance instruments. These findings can be used to inform the improved application and uptake of NbS, globally.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly recognized as a valid alternative to grey infrastructures - i.e. hard, human-engineered structures - as measures for reducing climate-related risks. Increasing evidences demonstrated that NBS can reduce risks to people and property as effectively as traditional grey infrastructures, but potentially offering many additional benefits, e.g. improving the natural habitat for wildlife, enhancing water and air quality, improving socio-cultural conditions of communities. The growing attention on the NBS, triggered an increasing interest in developing integrated and multi-disciplinary frameworks for assessing NBS effectiveness accounting for the co-benefits production. Starting from the analysis of the existing frameworks, this work claims for a more direct engagement of stakeholders - i.e. co-benefits beneficiaries - in developing NBS assessment framework. This work aims at demonstrating that differences in co-benefits perception and valuation might lead to trade-offs and, thus, to potential conflicts. An innovative methodology using a quasi-dynamic Fuzzy Cognitive Map approach based on multiple-time-steps was developed in order to assess NBS effectiveness, and to detect and analyze trade-offs among stakeholders due to differences in co-benefits perception. The developed methodology was implemented in the Lower Danube case study. The trade-off analysis among stakeholders shows that they are quite low in the short term. Most of the potential conflicts can be detected in the long term, involving mainly the stakeholders that assigned a high value to the agricultural productivity variable. The results demonstrated that accounting for the different stakeholders' perception of the co-benefits is key for reducing trade-offs and enhance NBS acceptability.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are being promoted as adaptive measures against predicted increasing hydrometeorological hazards (HMHs), such as heatwaves and floods which have already caused significant loss of life and economic damage across the globe. However, the underpinning factors such as policy framework, end-users' interests and participation for NBS design and operationalisation are yet to be established. We discuss the operationalisation and implementation processes of NBS by means of a novel concept of Open-Air Laboratories (OAL) for its wider acceptance. The design and implementation of environmentally, economically, technically and socio-culturally sustainable NBS require inter- and transdisciplinary approaches which could be achieved by fostering co-creation processes by engaging stakeholders across various sectors and levels, inspiring more effective use of skills, diverse knowledge, manpower and resources, and connecting and harmonising the adaptation aims. The OAL serves as a benchmark for NBS upscaling, replication and exploitation in policy-making process through monitoring by field measurement, evaluation by key performance indicators and building solid evidence on their short- and long-term multiple benefits in different climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions, thereby alleviating the challenges of political resistance, financial barriers and lack of knowledge. We conclude that holistic management of HMHs by effective use of NBS can be achieved with standard compliant data for replicating and monitoring NBS in OALs, knowledge about policy silos and interaction between research communities and end-users. Further research is needed for multi-risk analysis of HMHs and inclusion of NBS into policy frameworks, adaptable at local, regional and national scales leading to modification in the prevalent guidelines related to HMHs. The findings of this work can be used for developing synergies between current policy frameworks, scientific research and practical implementation of NBS in Europe and beyond for its wider acceptance.

AB  - Nature-based shoreline protection provides a welcome class of adaptations to promote ecological resilience in the face of climate change. Along coastlines, living shorelines are among the preferred adaptation strategies to both reduce erosion and provide ecological functions. As an alternative to shoreline armoring, living shorelines are viewed favorably among coastal managers and some private property owners, but they have yet to undergo a thorough examination of how their levels of ecosystem functions compare to their closest natural counterpart: fringing marshes. Here, we provide a synthesis of results from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish, invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia, USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading, placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S. alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic sands. These data support the prioritization of living shorelines as a coastal adaptation strategy.

AB  - Nature-based coastal protection is increasingly recognised as a potentially sustainable and cost-effective solution to reduce coastal flood risk. It uses coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests to create resilient designs for coastal flood protection. However, to use mangroves effectively as a nature-based measure for flood risk reduction, we must understand the biophysical processes that govern risk reduction capacity through mangrove ecosystem size and structure. In this perspective, we evaluate the current state of knowledge on local physical drivers and ecological processes that determine mangrove functioning as a part of a nature-based flood defence. We show that the forest properties that comprise coastal flood protection are well-known, but models cannot yet pinpoint how spatial heterogeneity of the forest structure affects the capacity for wave or surge attenuation. Overall, there is relatively good understanding of the ecological processes that drive forest structure and size, but there is a lack of knowledge on how daily bed-level dynamics link to long-term biogeomorphic forest dynamics and on the role of combined stressors influencing forest retreat. Integrating simulation models of forest structure under changing physical (e.g., due to sea-level change) and ecological drivers with hydrodynamic attenuation models will allow for better projections of long-term natural coastal protection.

AB  - Nature-based coastal defense schemes commonly value bivalve reefs for i) reducing coastal erosion in the intertidal and for ii) forming fringing reefs near salt marsh edges to protect them against lateral retreat. The capacity for a reef to reduce erosion increases at a higher position in the tidal frame as the lower over-lying water level magnifies the influence of the reef on wave attenuation. Unfortunately, ecological constraints on reef development typically limit their practical application in coastal protection schemes to the lower intertidal, as bivalves grow best with long inundation times. In micro-tidal areas this is a lesser problem, given the close proximity of lower and upper intertidal ecosystems in space. By contrast, in meso- and macro-tidal estuaries, bivalve reefs tend to form hundreds of meters away from existing marshes, nullifying any wave-protective benefits. In this study, we produce evidence that with the assistance of management measures, widespread reef formation is possible on open mudflats, including bordering the marsh edge in meso- and macro-tidal estuaries, where natural reef formation is normally strongly limited. In four locations throughout the meso- to macro-tidal Dutch Scheldt estuary, we observed the presence of individuals of two major intertidal reef-forming bivalves, Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), within low-lying Spartina anglica-dominated marshes. As these communities lie well outside of the expected range of reef formation, this observation suggests the existence of mechanisms that extend the habitable range of these bivalves. In a series of field experiments, we first demonstrate how the stabilization of shell-substrate within the marsh promotes successful establishment and adult survival. Secondly, by placing artificial stable substrate in transects from the subtidal up to the marsh edge, we demonstrate that bivalve establishment is possible throughout a much larger range of the intertidal than where natural reefs occur. The effectiveness of stable substrate in stimulating bivalve establishment is likely a consequence of bridging size-dependent thresholds that limit the effective range for natural reef formation on tidal flats. The success of this approach is tempered by a consistent decrease in reef size and growth at higher elevations, suggesting that the optimal reef position for utility in coastal defense lies at an intermediate tidal position, well above the observed range of natural occurrence, but below the maximum achievable upper limit of reef formation. Together this work provides a pathway forward concerning how artificial reefs may be fostered to increase their utility as a nature-based flood defense measure.

AB  - Natural World Heritage Sites (NWHS), which are of Outstanding Universal Value, are increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic pressures. This is especially true for coastal NWHS, which are additionally subject to erosion and flooding. This paper assesses shoreline change from 1984 to 2016 within the boundaries of 67 designated sites, providing a first global consistent assessment of its drivers. It develops a transferable methodology utilising new satellite-derived global shoreline datasets, which are classified based on linearity of change against time and compared with global datasets of geomorphology (topography, land cover, coastal type, and lithology), climate variability and sea-level change. Significant shoreline change is observed on 14% of 52 coastal NWHS shorelines that show the largest recessional and accretive trends (means of -3.4 m yr-1 and 3.5 m yr-1, respectively). These rapid shoreline changes are found in low-lying shorelines (< 1 m elevation) composed of unconsolidated sediments in vegetated tidal coastal systems (means of -7.7 m yr-1 and 12.5 m yr-1), and vegetated tidal deltas at the mouth of large river systems (means of -6.9 and 11 m yr-1). Extreme shoreline changes occur as a result of redistribution of sediment driven by a combination of geomorphological conditions with (1) specific natural coastal morphodynamics such as opening of inlets (e.g. Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve) or gradients of alongshore sediment transport (e.g. Namib Sea) and (2) direct or indirect human interferences with natural coastal processes such as sand nourishment (e.g. Wadden Sea) and damming of river sediments upstream of a delta (e.g. Danube Delta). The most stable soft coasts are associated with the protection of coral reef ecosystems (e.g. Great Barrier Reef) which may be degraded/destroyed by climate change or human stress in the future. A positive correlation between shoreline retreat and local relative sea-level change was apparent in the Wadden Sea. However, globally, the effects of contemporary sea-level rise are not apparent for coastal NWHS, but it is a major concern for the future reinforcing the shoreline dynamics already being observed due to other drivers. Hence, future assessments of shoreline change need to account of other drivers of coastal change in addition to sea-level rise projections. In conclusion, extreme multi-decadal linear shoreline trends occur in coastal NWHS and are driven primarily by sediment redistribution. Future exacerbation of these trends may affect heritage values and coastal communities. Thus shoreline change should be considered in future management plans where necessary. This approach provides a consistent method to assess NWHS which can be repeated and help steer future management of these important sites.

AB  - Natural infrastructure (NI) development, including ecosystem restoration, is an increasingly popular approach to leverage ecosystem services for sustainable development, climate resilience, and biodiversity conservation goals. Although implementation and planning for these tools is accelerating, there is a critical need for effective post-implementation monitoring to accumulate performance data and evidence for best practices. The complexity and longer time scales associated with NI, compounded by differing disciplinary definitions and concepts of monitoring necessitate a deliberate and strategic approach to monitoring that encompasses different timeframes and objectives. This paper outlines a typology of monitoring classes differentiated by temporal scale, purpose of data collection, the information benefits of monitoring, and the responsible party. Next, we provide a framework and practical guidelines for designing monitoring plans for NI around learning objectives. In particular, we emphasize conducting research and development monitoring, which provides scientifically rigorous evidence for methodological improvement beyond the project scale. Wherever feasible, and where NI tools are relatively new and untested, such monitoring should avoid wasted effort and ensure progress and refinement of methodology and practice over time. Finally, we propose institutional changes that would promote greater adoption of research and development monitoring to increase the evidence base for NI implementation at larger scales.

AB  - Natural habitats have the ability to protect coastal communities against the impacts of waves and storms, yet it is unclear how different habitats complement each other to reduce those impacts. Here, we investigate the individual and combined coastal protection services supplied by live corals on reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests during both non-storm and storm conditions, and under present and future sea-level conditions. Using idealized profiles of fringing and barrier reefs, we quantify the services supplied by these habitats using various metrics of inundation and erosion. We find that, together, live corals, seagrasses, and mangroves supply more protection services than any individual habitat or any combination of two habitats. Specifically, we find that, while mangroves are the most effective at protecting the coast under non-storm and storm conditions, live corals and seagrasses also moderate the impact of waves and storms, thereby further reducing the vulnerability of coastal regions. Also, in addition to structural differences, the amount of service supplied by habitats in our analysis is highly dependent on the geomorphic setting, habitat location and forcing conditions: live corals in the fringing reef profile supply more protection services than seagrasses; seagrasses in the barrier reef profile supply more protection services than live corals; and seagrasses, in our simulations, can even compensate for the long-term degradation of the barrier reef. Results of this study demonstrate the importance of taking integrated and place-based approaches when quantifying and managing for the coastal protection services supplied by ecosystems.

AB  - Natural ecosystems are expected to reduce the damaging effects of extreme hydrometeorological effects. We tested this prediction for Mexico by performing regression models, with two dependent variables: the occurrence of deaths and economic damages, at a state and municipality levels. For each location, the explanatory variables were the Mexican social vulnerability index (which includes socioeconomic aspects, local capacity to prevent and respond to an emergency, and the perception of risk) and land use cover considering different vegetation types. We used the hydrometeorological events that have affected Mexico from 1970 to 2011. Our findings reveal that: (a) hydrometeorological events affect both coastal and inland states, although damages are greater on the coast; (b) the protective role of natural ecosystems only was clear at a municipality level: the presence of mangroves, tropical dry forest and tropical rainforest was related to a significant reduction in the occurrence of casualties. Social vulnerability was positively correlated with the occurrence of deaths. Natural ecosystems, both typically coastal (mangroves) and terrestrial (tropical forests, which are located on the mountain ranges close to the coast) function for storm protection. Thus, their conservation and restoration are effective and sustainable strategies that will help protect and develop the increasingly urbanized coasts.

AB  - Native oyster reefs once dominated many estuaries, ecologically and economically. Centuries of resource extraction exacerbated by coastal degradation have pushed oyster reefs to the brink of functional extinction worldwide. We examined the condition of oyster reefs across 144 bays and 44 ecoregions; our comparisons of past with present abundances indicate that more than 90% of them have been lost in bays (70%) and ecoregions (63%). In many bays, more than 99% of oyster reefs have been lost and are functionally extinct. Overall, we estimate that 85% of oyster reefs have been lost globally. Most of the world's remaining wild capture of native oysters (> 75%) comes from just five ecoregions in North America, yet the condition of reefs in these ecoregions is poor at best, except in the Gulf of Mexico. We identify many cost-effective solutions for conservation, restoration, and the management of fisheries and nonnative species that could reverse these oyster losses and restore reef ecosystem services.

AB  - Native Americans created shell middens along estuarine shorelines, and these archeologically significant sites are now threatened by erosion and sea level rise. We worked with Canaveral National Seashore to apply living shoreline techniques to protect middens using stabilized oyster shell, Spartina alterniflora, and Rhizophora mangle. Deployed mangroves were successful in terms of survival, growth, and reproduction, but natural recruitment following stabilization was minimal. After evaluating natural mangrove recruitment at stabilized and neighboring shorelines, we found propagule and seedling counts were significantly lower at stabilized shorelines. Third, we experimentally tested effects of varying sediment grain sizes on R. mangle. Overall, survival and growth were high in all treatments, suggesting that seedlings were not inhibited by the presence of large oyster shell fragments. Combined, this suggests that the retention and transition of the R. mangle propagule into a seedling is being limited in the field. Large shell potentially acts as a barrier for initial anchoring in the sediment or increasing likelihood of dislodgement during movement by boat or wind wakes. The human-altered substrate at shell middens may prevent natural recovery of vegetated shorelines, highlighting the need for on-going management for long-term protection of these archeological sites.

AB  - Much recent marine research has been directed towards understanding the effects of anthropogenic-induced environmental change on marine biodiversity, particularly for those animals with heavily calcified exoskeletons, such as corals, molluscs and urchins. This is because life in our oceans is becoming more challenging for these animals with changes in temperature, pH and salinity. In the future, it will be more energetically expensive to make marine skeletons and the increasingly corrosive conditions in seawater are expected to result in the dissolution of these external skeletons. However, initial predictions of wide-scale sensitivity are changing as we understand more about the mechanisms underpinning skeletal production (biomineralization). These studies demonstrate the complexity of calcification pathways and the cellular responses of animals to these altered conditions. Factors including parental conditioning, phenotypic plasticity and epigenetics can significantly impact the production of skeletons and thus future population success. This understanding is paralleled by an increase in our knowledge of the genes and proteins involved in biomineralization, particularly in some phyla, such as urchins, molluscs and corals. This Review will provide a broad overview of our current understanding of the factors affecting skeletal production in marine invertebrates. It will focus on the molecular mechanisms underpinning biomineralization and how knowledge of these processes affects experimental design and our ability to predict responses to climate change. Understanding marine biomineralization has many tangible benefits in our changing world, including improvements in conservation and aquaculture and exploitation of natural calcified structure design using biomimicry approaches that are aimed at producing novel biocomposites.

AB  - Much of the United States’ critical infrastructure is either aging or requires significant repair, leaving U.S. communities and the economy vulnerable. Outdated and dilapidated infrastructure places coastal communities, in particular, at risk from the increasingly frequent and intense coastal storm events and rising sea levels. Therefore, investments in coastal infrastructure are urgently needed to ensure community safety and prosperity; however, these investments should not jeopardize the ecosystems and natural resources that underlie economic wealth and human well-being. Over the past 50 years, efforts have been made to integrate built infrastructure with natural landscape features, often termed “green” infrastructure, in order to sustain and restore valuable ecosystem functions and services. For example, significant advances have been made in implementing green infrastructure approaches for stormwater management, wastewater treatment, and drinking water conservation and delivery. However, the implementation of natural and nature-based infrastructure (NNBI) aimed at flood prevention and coastal erosion protection is lagging. There is an opportunity now, as the U.S. government reacts to the recent, unprecedented flooding and hurricane damage and considers greater infrastructure investments, to incorporate NNBI into coastal infrastructure projects. Doing so will increase resilience and provide critical services to local communities in a cost-effective manner and thereby help to sustain a growing economy.

AB  - Most existing analytical and numerical models to quantify wave energy attenuation attributed to saltmarshes are based on the definition of a drag coefficient that varies with vegetation and wave characteristics and requires calibration, i.e., a case-specific variable. With the aim of determining a new variable to estimate wave energy attenuation without the use of calibration coefficients, wave attenuation caused by different saltmarsh species and the relationship with the ecosystem standing biomass are experimentally studied. Samples of four real saltmarshes with contrasting morphological and biomechanical properties, namely, Spartina sp., Salicornia sp., Halimione sp. and Juncus sp., are collected in the field and placed in a wave flume for testing under different regular and random wave conditions. Two meadow densities are considered, in addition to zero-density cases. Thus, wave damping coefficients are obtained in vegetated cases, β, and bare soil cases, β<sub>B</sub>, and wave damping produced solely by the meadow standing biomass, β<sub>SB</sub>, is determined. The obtained wave damping coefficients are related to a new variable, the hydraulic standing biomass (HSB), which is defined as a function of the meadow mean height and standing biomass and incident flow characteristics. Linear fitting relationships between the wave damping coefficient and HSB are obtained, allowing β and β<sub>SB</sub> estimation without the need for calibration. Therefore, the use of these new relationships facilitates direct quantification of wave energy attenuation due to saltmarshes based on incident wave conditions, mean plant height and meadow standing biomass, variables that can be obtained from aerial images or remote sensing data, extending the applicability of the approach. Another key aspect is that this approach does not depend on any calibration coefficient and can be directly applied with knowledge of the abovementioned characteristics. This may represent a paradigm shift in the estimation of wave energy attenuation attributed to saltmarshes.

AB  - More than 50 percent of Americans live in coastal watershed counties, a percentage that continues to increase (see section 1.3). In addition, the coast is home to the majority of major urban centers as well as major infrastructure such as seaports, airports, transportation routes, oil import and refining facilities, power plants, and military facilities. All of these human uses, which represent trillions of dollars in economic investment as well as valuable coastal ecosystems, are vulnerable in varying degrees to rising global temperature and hazards such as sea-level rise, storms, and extreme floods. Intense human activity over the past century has degraded many coastal environments and stressed natural ecosystems. Nationwide, nearshore areas and estuaries are polluted with excess nitrogen and other chemicals, toxic coastal algal blooms are increasing, fish stocks are depleted, wetland loss has been dramatic, and coral reefs are bleached and dying. Climate change exacerbates these stresses on ecosystems.

AB  - Mean flow and turbulence measurements collected in a shallow Halodule wrightii shoal grass fringe highlighted significant heterogeneity in hydrodynamic effects over relatively small spatial scales. Experiments were conducted within the vegetation canopy (~4 cm above bottom) for relatively sparse (40% cover) and dense (70% cover) vegetation, with reference measurements collected near the bed above bare sediment. Significant benthic velocity shear was observed at all sample locations, with canopy shear layers that penetrated nearly to the bed at both vegetated sites. Turbulent shear production (P) was balanced by turbulent kinetic energy dissipation (ϵ) at all sample locations (P/ϵ≈1), suggesting that stem-generated turbulence played a minor role in the overall turbulence budget. While the more sparsely vegetated sample site was associated with enhanced channel-to-shore velocity attenuation (71.4 ± 1.0%) relative to flows above bare sediment (51.7 ± 2.2%), unexpectedly strong cross-shore currents were observed nearshore in the dense canopy (VNS), with magnitudes that were nearly twice as large as those measured in the main channel (VCH; VNS/VCH¯ = 1.81 ± 0.08). These results highlight the importance of flow steering and acceleration for within- and across-canopy transport, especially at the scale of individual vegetation patches, with important implications for nutrient and sediment fluxes. Importantly, this work represents one of the first hydrodynamic studies of shoal grass fringes in shallow coastal estuaries, as well as one of the only reports of turbulent mixing within H. wrightii canopies.

AB  - Marsh terracing is a coastal restoration technique that has been implemented in Louisiana and Texas for almost 30 years. Marsh terraces are segmented ridges of soil built in inland coastal ponds for the objectives of creating new marsh, disrupting fetch, and dissipating wind-driven wave energy, which causes marsh erosion. Despite widespread implementation, no numerical modeling studies have been conducted to understand the effect of terraces on wave climate in marsh environments. The objectives of this study were to: 1) simulate wave climates in marsh terrace fields using the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model and evaluate the agreement between modeled and observed wave conditions and 2) assess the effectiveness of marsh terraces at reducing significant wave height by comparing wave climates in terraced sites with hypothetical unterraced sites. The SWAN model was used to simulate wind-waves at two terrace fields in coastal Louisiana. Model validation was performed using data collected with in situ wave instruments and wind data measured by NOAA stations located 25 km to the east and 62 km to the northeast of the study area. Results from this study modeled and measured small (0.03–0.14 m) and high–frequency waves (0.80–1.29 s) in the marsh terrace fields. Model validation revealed agreement between modeled and observed data, particularly for significant wave height and direction. Additionally, a comparison of wave climates in terraced and unterraced marsh environments indicated an average significant wave height reduction of 45% (min:18%, max: 84%) when terraces were present. Overall, the model was able to evaluate wave climates in marsh terrace fields and assess the effectiveness of this restoration technique in reducing significant wave height. The model's performance in this low energy and complex environment (shallow water, nonlinear shoreline, marsh fragmentated) is encouraging given the lack of research assessing wave parameters in marsh terrace environments. • Marsh terraces are effective at reducing wave energy. • Terraces reduced significant wave height (Hs) up to 84%. • Small (0.03 to 0.14 m) and high-frequency (0.80 to 1.29 s) waves were measured. • SWAN may be appropriate for use in low energy and complex systems.

AB  - Marsh erosion is a major concern for estuaries as various factors threaten shorelines. The ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa is a prominent component of the Delaware Bay estuarine ecosystem. A synergistic relationship exists between the ribbed mussel and the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora in which the deposition of nutrient rich feces from the mussels enhances S. alterniflora production, helping to create natural levees along the marsh edge. These levees and marsh vegetation trap sediments enhancing vertical accretion. From this synergistic relationship, it is hypothesized that, within certain energy regimes, salt marsh shoreline erosion decreases as mussel density increases. To test the hypothesis, mussel and plant demographics, mass transfer rates (energy), nutrient concentrations and annual lateral shoreline movement were quantified at three sites within four tributaries of the Delaware Estuary (n = 12 sites). In order to avoid spurious correlations due to the large number of potential interactions, Bayesian factorial and hierarchical modeling techniques were employed to identify potential relationships that occur between the variables within and among study sites. Results indicated that while the presence of mussels and the mass transfer rate of the adjacent water body influence the degree of erosion or accretion measured at the study sites, the river, and the location of the site within it, plays a major role in determining the degree to which these factors have an effect.M.S.Includes bibliographical referencesby Joshua Andrew Mood

AB  - MARRS (Mars Assisted Reef Restoration System) is an artificial reef method that resembles spider webs and has been implemented in several regions of Indonesia, including Samuh beach, Nusa Dua, Bali. Since July - October 2018, 761 MARRS units, supporting a total of ± 10,600 coral fragments, have been installed. The aim of this research is to provide an initial investigation into establishing a mini-coral reef park in Indonesia. Monitoring was done by identifying habitat geomorphology methods with photo transects and coral propagation status in MARRS using the random visual census method. From the process of habitat geomorphology classification in the artificial reef network, there were 9 types of habitat classified on the fringing reef, reef flats and fore reefs. Ten hard coral species from the Scleractinia group were identified from 10 randomly-selected and monitored MARRS units: Acropora formosa, A. hyacinthus, Pocillopora verucosa, P. damicornis, Psammocora sp., Symphyllia sp., Stylophora pistillata, Turbinaria sp., Echinopora sp. and Favites sp. Three significant coral factors were found to be present within the coral propagation system: resistance, competition and predators.

AB  - Marine coastal (or “blue”) ecosystems provide valuable services to humanity and the environment, but global loss and degradation of blue ecosystems necessitates ecological restoration. However, blue restoration is an emerging field and is still relatively experimental and small-scale. Identification of the key barriers to scaling-up blue restoration will enable targeted problem solving and increase the likelihood of success. Here we describe the environmental, technical, social, economic, and political barriers to restoration of blue ecosystems, including saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass, shellfish reefs, coral reefs, and kelp forests. We provide managers, practitioners, and decision-makers with solutions to construct barrier-informed blue restoration plans and illustrate these solutions through the use of case studies where barriers were overcome. We offer a way forward to build confidence in blue restoration for society, government, and restoration practitioners at larger and more ambitious scales.

AB  - Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

AB  - Many coral reef systems are shelf-based and consist of reefs that are arranged in rows parallel to the coastline. They usually show an increase in species richness in the offshore direction, coinciding with decreasing terrigenous impact and a deeper seafloor. These two conditions usually concur, which makes it less easy to distinguish how each of them influences coral diversity separately. Since reefs off Jakarta (in the Thousand Islands archipelago) are arranged in an 80 km long string perpendicular to the coastline in south-to-north direction, with a maximum shelf depth halfway along (instead of at the end of) the string, this archipelago is very suitable for studies on inshore–offshore gradients. In the present study, mushroom corals (Fungiidae; n = 31) were used to examine diversity patterns on 38 reef sites along such a gradient, involving species richness over their entire depth range from reef flat to reef base (2–30 m) and separately at shallow depths (2–6 m). Total species diversity was highest in the central part of the archipelago, with unique species occurring in deep habitats. Diversity at shallow depths was only slightly higher here than at reefs located more nearshore and offshore, which both had less clear water. Therefore, shelf depth and distance from the mainland can be considered separate determinants of coral diversity off Jakarta.

AB  - Many coastal-dependent species have undergone large-scale population declines due to impacts from habitat loss, including American oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus). Islands along the Big Bend region of Florida’s Gulf Coast provide important nesting habitat for oystercatchers, but reproductive success here is low and habitat degradation and loss are a major concern. To determine rates and characteristics of habitat loss, we quantified changes in island sizes within two major breeding areas of the Big Bend: the Barge Canal spoil islands and natural islands at Cedar Key. We digitized aerial photographs from the past ~ 40 years, measured area and shoreline retreat of nesting islands, and identified trends over time by fitting linear mixed effects models. The total area of the ten Barge Canal spoil islands decreased by 55% between 1979 and 2016. At Cedar Key, the total area of the six islands measured decreased by 39% between 1974 and 2016, 85% of which occurred after 1995, indicating an increase in erosion rates correlated with oyster reef declines. Changes in available nesting habitat varied between the Barge Canal and Cedar Key islands due to differences in physical attributes; however, all islands significantly decreased in size over time. Given the long life and high site fidelity of American oystercatchers, these islands may currently be acting as an ecological trap for this species. Climate change, sea-level rise, and loss of oyster reefs are likely to continue to drive oystercatcher habitat loss throughout their range; thus, creation and restoration of oyster reefs and nesting islands will become increasingly important.

AB  - Mangroves play an important role in sustaining a healthy coastal environment, providing a natural habitat to various species, a stable shoreline and forestry products. However, the extent of mangroves developed along the tidal coast of the Mekong delta in southern Vietnam has faced and still faces the impact from both natural and anthropogenic drivers. Since the area of mangroves in the coastal Mekong delta is not well documented, this study aims to quantitatively document the evolution of the mangrove area over the past 48 years, i.e. between 1973 and 2020. Satellite Landsat images, along with a classification method comprising Iso Cluster and Maximum Likelihood algorithms, have been used for mapping land cover types including mangroves, aquaculture, soils, plants and water surfaces along the coastal districts of the Mekong delta. The study shows that remote sensing and GIS techniques can be applied to obtain mapping of the land cover, as well as detect and analyse spatial and temporal changes caused by e.g. coastal erosion or aquaculture expansion. The findings reveal that the total mangrove area of an estimated 185,800 ha in 1973 decreased significantly to 102,160 ha in 2020. Approximately 2150 ha/yr of the total mangrove loss over 1973–2020 was due to invasion by aquaculture, while roughly 430 ha/yr was lost due to coastal erosion. A slight increase in mangrove area occurred since 2010 as a result of the implementation of a series of projects to protect against coastal erosion and to restore mangroves by the Vietnamese government and international non-governmental and governmental organizations, although the success rates of mangrove restoration are relatively low. The survival of mangrove forests in the Mekong delta is related to the main pressure drivers: pollution, land use conversion, insufficient sediment sources, coastal erosion and coastal mangrove squeeze. Therefore, an integrated mangroves and shrimp farming model is one of the most appropriate approaches to achieve a beneficial balance between both aquaculture and mangroves. • A detailed picture of long-term mangroves and other land cover types dynamics in the coastal area of the Mekong delta during 48 years is revealed. • The main threatening drivers to the survival of the mangrove in the Mekong delta include pollution, land use conversion, insufficient nutrient-enriched sediment, coastal erosion, coastal mangrove squeeze and improper mangrove restoration techniques in local regions. • The integrated mangroves and shrimp farming model is one of the most appropriate approaches to achieve a beneficial balance between both aquaculture and mangroves. • Landsat images are capable to evaluate the dynamics of mangrove and other land cover categories in the spatial and temporal scale.

AB  - Mangroves have been suggested as an eco-defense strategy to dissipate tsunamis, storm surges, and king tides. As such, efforts have increased to replant forests along coasts that are vulnerable to flooding. The leafy canopies, stems, and aboveground root structures of mangroves limit water exchange across a forest, reducing flood amplitudes. The attenuation of long waves in mangroves was measured using cross-shore transects of pressure sensors in two contrasting environments in New Zealand, both characterized by mono-specific cultures of grey mangroves (Avicennia marina) and approximate cross-shore widths of 1 km. The first site, in the Firth of Thames, was characterized by mangrove trees with heights between 0.5 and 3 m, and pneumatophore roots with an average height of 0.2 m, and no substantial tidal drainage channels. Attenuation was measured during storm surge conditions. In this environment, the tidal and surge currents had no alternative pathway than to be forced into the high-drag mangrove vegetation. Observations showed that much of the dissipation occurred at the seaward fringe of the forest, with an average attenuation rate of 0.24 m/km across the forest width. The second site, in Tauranga harbor, was characterized by shorter mangroves between 0.3 and 1.2 m in height and deeply incised drainage channels. No attenuation of the flood tidal wave across the mangrove forest was measurable. Instead, flow preferentially propagated along the unvegetated low-drag channels, reaching the back of the forest much more efficiently than in the Firth of Thames. Our observations from sites with the same vegetation type suggest that mangrove properties are important to long wave dissipation only if water transport through the vegetation is a dominant mechanism of fluid transport. Therefore, realistic predictions of potential coastal protection should be made prior to extensive replanting efforts.

AB  - Mangroves are thought to provide vital ecosystem services to coastal fishing communities through the enhancement of fisheries production. Ongoing loss of mangrove extent globally is therefore of societal concern given that communities living near mangroves rely on mangrove-fishing for income and subsistence. Whilst research and conservation efforts have successfully advocated mangrove restoration, and promoted the importance of mangroves in climate mitigation and coastal protection, knowledge of how people use mangroves for fishing is less well developed (Chapters 1 and 2). To date, most quantitative estimates of the value of the presence of mangroves to fishing have been limited to single fishing sectors, gear types or species groups and therefore fail to capture the full diversity of fishing practices, and thus the true socio-economic benefits of mangrove-fishing. The thesis first develops a definition of what mangrove-fisheries can encompass. A case study which investigated the fishing activities associated with mangroves through interviews with fishers was conducted in the Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia. A framework based on this case study was developed as a flexible tool for identifying the characteristics of a mangrove-fishery in a local context (Chapter 3). Using this framework, Chapter 4 measured the all-encompassing value of mangrove benefits to fishing in the Peam Krasaop Fishing Community (PKFC), Koh Kong Province, southwest Cambodia. The ecosystem service value of mangroves for fishing to households in the PKFC was arrived at using daily landings volumes and market values provided through interview surveys with fishers. Both chapters highlight the highly diverse nature of mangrove-fisheries. To what extent are the benefits of mangrove purely local phenomena or are these benefits reflected in global catch datasets? Chapter 5 investigates the spatial relationships between mangrove extent and fisheries catches at the global scale. For the period 2000-2012, small-scale (artisanal and subsistence) catch data, from the Sea Around Us fisheries catch database, was matched against high resolution mangrove extent maps from the Global Database of Continuous Mangrove Forest Cover for the 21st Century revealing that contrary to much of the previous literature, variation in mangrove-associated species catches is better explained by proximity to the mangrove than by mangrove area. Finally, Chapter 6 considers how new and emergent technologies, such as real-time vessel tracking, are likely to improve our ability to estimate mangrove-fishery value, assesses the potential of restored mangroves in providing ecosystem services, and reflects on how communities will need to respond to pressures on mangrove-fishery livelihoods from global environmental change.

AB  - Mangroves are one of the most valuable and productive coastal ecosystems. Previous studies show a severe loss of mangroves around the world over the last several decades due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Mangroves located in the southeastern part of the Mekong River Delta (MRD) are also affected by these activities. Shrimp farming is considered as one of the main drivers causing the rapid loss and degradation of mangroves. The goal of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal changes in land use and distribution of mangroves in the Soc Trang and Bac Lieu provinces of the southeastern part of the MRD. Multi-temporal Landsat data were used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using the maximum-likelihood classification algorithm. The changes in mangrove forest areas were monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager) satellite imageries from 1988 to 2018. In the study area, there were seven major LULC types namely, dense mangroves, sparse mangroves, aquaculture farms, arable land with crop cover, arable land without crop cover, settlements, and water bodies. The overall accuracies of the LULC maps in 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018 were 81.2%, 83.3%, 78.3%, and 81.9%, respectively. This study reveals that dense and sparse mangrove forests have decreased by 90% from 5495 hectares (ha) to 515 ha and by 55% from 14,105 to 6289 ha, respectively from 1988 to 2018. On the other hand, the aquaculture farm has increased at the rate of 5024 ha/year for a period of 30 years. This rapid growth of aquaculture farming activities caused the rapid loss and degradation of mangroves in the MRD. Quantitative information about mangrove change obtained by this study is considered to be useful for future coastal management and relevant policies in the MRD.

AB  - Mangroves are believed to stabilize the coastlines by controlling erosion and facilitating sediment deposition. Coastal managers often plant mangroves to counter coastal erosion. The state of Gujarat in West India has planted thousands of hectares of mangroves over the years, and control of coastal erosion has been one of the prime reasons of plantation. This study performed a statistical assessment of the effect of the planted mangroves on the coastline changes in the state from 1990 to 2013. The study utilized geographic information system and remote sensing data to demarcate the areas under erosion and accretion during this period, and then compared these changes with the change in mangrove cover using statistical models. This cross-sectional analysis was conducted at the level of a tehsil, an administrative unit below a district. The results show that mangrove plantation did not decrease erosion, not even after normalizing the coastline changes by the length of the coastline and using controls for physical and anthropogenic features of the tehsils. Tehsils with increased mangrove cover witnessed both increased erosion and accretion, although the latter was much higher. The geophysical features of the area appeared to be the main determinants of coastline changes in Gujarat.

AB  - Mangrove vegetation provides natural protection against coastal hazards like flooding and erosion. In spite of their economic and societal value, mangrove forests have experienced a worldwide decline due to human activities. Bamboo structures, formed by poles driven into the soil, are being used to create a sheltered environment for mangrove restoration. The lack of design rules for the structures has led to mixed success rates in their implementation. Improving future designs requires a better understanding of how the bamboo poles affect waves and currents. Currents cause drag forces on the poles, which depend on flow acceleration through the elements (blockage), and the distance from wakes of upstream cylinders (sheltering). We developed a model that predicts the bulk drag coefficient of dense arrays of emergent cylinders in a current, including blockage, sheltering and a balance between turbulence production and dissipation. The model could reproduce measured bulk drag coefficients from the literature within a deviation of 20%. The model also showed that anisotropic structures with small spanwise spacing and large streamwise separation maximize the bulk drag coefficient, and the energy dissipation per pole. The application of the model can guide the design of future mangrove restoration efforts.

AB  - Mangrove vegetation constitutes a natural coastal defence against waves and erosion. Despite their protective role, mangrove ecosystems have experienced continuous degradation over the last decades due to human causes. At retreating mangrove coastlines, bamboo structures are built to create new habitat for mangrove colonization. Existing structures have experienced mixed rates of success due to the lack of a scientific basis in their design. Optimizing future structure designs requires investigating the effect of the bamboo poles on waves. We consequently conducted laboratory experiments to measure wave transformation, hydrodynamic forces, and flow velocities inside cylinder arrays, mimicking bamboo poles, with varying cylinder configurations and orientations. The experiments provided relationships for wave transmission, wave reflection, and the drag coefficients for configurations with volumetric porosities between n = 0.64 − 0.9. Configurations with a small lateral spacing (causing higher blockage) and a relatively longer streamwise spacing (causing less sheltering) exhibit larger forces and dissipation per element. Such arrangements enable optimizing wave dissipation at locations where the wave direction has low variability over the year. Placing the poles horizontally instead of vertically increases the forces and wave dissipation per element in relatively deeper water. Based on the experiments, we developed a conceptual analytical model that predicts wave reflection and dissipation through cylinder arrays, including blockage and sheltering. The model can reproduce the influence of cylinder arrangement on wave transformation, and it suggests that accurate predictions of sheltering and wave reflection are important to find optimal designs. Overall, these results provide useful insights on how to model and optimize the design of structures for mangrove restoration.

AB  - Mangrove restoration has become a popular strategy to ensure the critical functions and economic benefits of this ecosystem. This study conducts a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on the outcomes of mangrove restoration. On aggregate, restored mangroves provide higher ecosystem functions than unvegetated tidal flats but lower than natural mangrove stands (respectively RR’ = 0.43, 95%CIs = 0.23 to 0.63; RR’ = −0.21, 95%CIs = −0.34 to −0.08), while they perform on par with naturally-regenerated mangroves and degraded mangroves. However, restoration outcomes vary widely between functions and comparative bases, and are mediated by factors such as restoration age, species, and restoration method. Furthermore, mangrove restoration offers positive benefit-cost ratios ranging from 10.50 to 6.83 under variable discount rates (−2% to 8%), suggesting that mangrove restoration is a cost-effective form of ecosystem management. Overall, the results suggest that mangrove restoration has substantial potential to contribute to multiple policy objectives related to biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and sustainable development. Ambitious global targets exist for mangrove restoration. A meta-analysis reveals how mangrove restoration provides higher ecosystem benefits over unvegetated tidal flats, while generally lower than natural mangroves. Restoration outcomes, however, depend on restoration age, species and method.

AB  - Mangrove is classified as an important ecosystem along the shorelines of tropical and subtropical landmasses, which are being degraded at an alarming rate despite numerous international treaties having been agreed. Iskandar Malaysia (IM) is a fast-growing economic region in southern Peninsular Malaysia, where three Ramsar Sites are located. Since the beginning of the 21st century (2000–2019), a total loss of 2907.29 ha of mangrove area has been estimated based on medium-high resolution remote sensing data. This corresponds to an annual loss rate of 1.12%, which is higher than the world mangrove depletion rate. The causes of mangrove loss were identified as land conversion to urban, plantations, and aquaculture activities, where large mangrove areas were shattered into many smaller patches. Fragmentation analysis over the mangrove area shows a reduction in the mean patch size (from 105 ha to 27 ha) and an increase in the number of mangrove patches (130 to 402), edge, and shape complexity, where smaller and isolated mangrove patches were found to be related to the rapid development of IM region. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) products were used to inspect the impact of fragmentation on the mangrove ecosystem process. The mean LAI and GPP of mangrove areas that had not undergone any land cover changes over the years showed an increase from 3.03 to 3.55 (LAI) and 5.81 g C m−2 to 6.73 g C m−2 (GPP), highlighting the ability of the mangrove forest to assimilate CO2 when it is not disturbed. Similarly, GPP also increased over the gained areas (from 1.88 g C m−2 to 2.78 g C m−2). Meanwhile, areas that lost mangroves, but replaced them with oil palm, had decreased mean LAI from 2.99 to 2.62. In fragmented mangrove patches an increase in GPP was recorded, and this could be due to the smaller patches (<9 ha) and their edge effects where abundance of solar radiation along the edges of the patches may increase productivity. The impact on GPP due to fragmentation is found to rely on the type of land transformation and patch characteristics (size, edge, and shape complexity). The preservation of mangrove forests in a rapidly developing region such as IM is vital to ensure ecosystem, ecology, environment, and biodiversity conservation, in addition to providing economical revenue and supporting human activities.

AB  - Mangrove forests, that often act as natural coastal defences, enormously suffered due to ongoing climate change and human disturbances. Thus, it is necessary to have a countermeasure to mitigate the loss of mangroves. Wooden fences are becoming a viable nature-based solution to protect vulnerable replanted mangrove forests. However, the wooden fence's hydraulic characteristics are not yet fully understood due to the complication of branches arrangement. In the present study, a small-scale wave flume modelling of wave damping by a wooden fence was constructed using the inner branches as an inhomogeneous arrangement tested in earlier flow-resistance experiments. The physical model results indicate that the wooden fence is highly effective on wave transmission and that the effectiveness in wave reduction depends on the relative fence thickness, B/Hi. To understand the scale effect on wave transmission further, the numerical model SWASH was used with the laboratory wave data. By applying the prior experiments' drag coefficient on steady flow, the uncalibrated numerical model gave a good agreement with the wave model results, with a root-mean-square error for the total transmitted wave heights of 4.7%. After validation, potential scale effects for small scale tests were determined from scaling simulations at both full scales and the applied 1:5 model scale. These simulations were performed for a fence porosity of 0.81, and different fence thicknesses to understand scale effects between model- and full-scale. Both wave reflection and transmission at model-scale are about 5% higher than full-scale results due to the increased drag coefficient and viscous effects. The effects of fence thickness and porosity were the same in large and small scale, and much larger than the error due to scale effects. Hence testing fence efficiency at physical small scale is regarded as a useful tool, together with numerical modelling.

AB  - Managers are moving from a model of managing individual sectors, human activities, or ecosystem services to an ecosystem-based management (EBM) approach which attempts to balance the range of services provided by ecosystems. Applying EBM is often difficult due to inherent tradeoffs in managing for different services. This challenge particularly holds for estuarine systems, which have been heavily altered in most regions and are often subject to intense management interventions. Estuarine managers can often choose among a range of management tactics to enhance a particular service; although some management actions will result in strong tradeoffs, others may enhance multiple services simultaneously. Management of estuarine ecosystems could be improved by distinguishing between optimal management actions for enhancing multiple services and those that have severe tradeoffs. This requires a framework that evaluates tradeoff scenarios and identifies management actions likely to benefit multiple services. We created a management action-services matrix as a first step towards assessing tradeoffs and providing managers with a decision support tool. We found that management actions that restored or enhanced natural vegetation (e.g., salt marsh and mangroves) and some shellfish (particularly oysters and oyster reef habitat) benefited multiple services. In contrast, management actions such as desalination, salt pond creation, sand mining, and large container shipping had large net negative effects on several of the other services considered in the matrix. Our framework provides resource managers a simple way to inform EBM decisions and can also be used as a first step in more sophisticated approaches that model service delivery.

AB  - Management and restoration of wild oyster populations with the ecosystem services they provide require detailed understanding of oyster population dynamics, including temporally and spatially varying growth. Much of the existing literature documenting growth rates for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) reports growth for large, protected, and/or hatchery-spawned oysters. By following growth of wild oysters set on planted clamshells in Delaware Bay, we document early growth (within the first year) of 21 wild oyster cohorts settling over 8 years and assess the importance of interannual variability in temperature and salinity. In general, oysters follow a linear growth trajectory in the first year of life, interspersed by periods of little to no growth in the colder months. Wild oysters settling in the Delaware Bay mid-salinity region reach a size between 27 and 33 mm in their first year and tend to reach greater shell heights at 1 year of age in higher salinity years and at temperatures averaging 23 °C. Multi-year, population-level estimates of wild growth such as these are important for understanding changes in restored and managed oyster populations, and resulting ecosystem services, under naturally variable conditions.

AB  - Managed realignment (MR) constitutes a form of nature-based adaptation to coastal hazards, including sea level rise and storm surges. The implementation of MR aims at the (re)creation of intertidal habitats, such as saltmarshes, for mitigating flood and erosion risks and for creating more natural shorelines. However, some evidence suggests that the desired coastal protection function of MR schemes (in terms of high water level (HWL) attenuation) may be limited and it was hypothesized that this was due to the configuration of the remaining seawalls, which we refer to as scheme design. Here we present the results of a hydrodynamic model application, which we used to analyse the effects of scheme design on within-site HWL attenuation by applying six scheme designs that differ in terms of breach characteristics and water storage capacity. In specific, we vary the configuration of the seaward defence line (including the seawall breaches) and the position of the landward dike by modifying the digital elevation model of the site. Our results show that changes in scheme design, particularly storage area and number and width of breaches, had significant effects on the site's HWL attenuation capacity. Decreasing the tidal prism by changing the number and size of breaches, with the site area kept constant, leads to increased modelled HWL attenuation rates. However, average HWL attenuation rates of >10 cm km−1 are only achieved when site size increases. The mean high water depth of each scheme design scenario, calculated by dividing tidal prism by MR area, explains most of the variation in average HWL attenuation between all scenarios. Attention to potential within-site hydrodynamics at the design stage will aid the construction of more effective MR schemes with respect to coastal protection in the future.

AB  - Maintaining the functional integrity of ecosystems as climate pressures exceed natural rates of adaptation requires new knowledge and new approaches to governance and management. However, research into management interventions to assist regional ecosystem adaptation has generated both scientific and ethical debate. This paper reviews experience to date in order to identify the challenges and opportunities for assisted regional ecosystem adaptation and reflect on the implications for ongoing adaptation research. The review was informed by a database and structured analysis of some 450 reports, peer-reviewed manuscripts and books on participation theory and experience with novel technology development and assisted ecosystem adaptation. We identified five classes of challenges to adaptation research: 1) scientific conflicts and debates over the “facts”, 2) social challenges, 3) governance challenges, 4) epistemic challenges, and 5) ontological conflicts. We argue that engagement strategies linked to the multiple objectives of adaptation research provide opportunities for ecosystem adaptation.

AB  - Local and global stressors have led to rapid declines in coral reef health around the world. A range of active restoration techniques have recently been introduced in attempts to stem and reverse this decline, but their efficacy is debated. In particular, restoration faces the challenge of scale; successful projects must be deployed quickly over large areas, without being prohibitively expensive. Indonesia has more coral reefs – and more coral reef restoration programmes – than any other country on Earth. The past two decades have seen a rapid expansion in the scale of Indonesia’s restoration efforts. Having started in the 1980s, there are now hundreds of individual programmes across the country, several of which have outplanted tens of thousands of corals. Here, we identify ten different social, economic and environmental approaches that have contributed to this scaling up of reef restoration in Indonesia. We discuss the theoretical basis for each approach and provide case studies of their implementation from sixteen different Indonesian programmes. In combination, these diverse approaches have created opportunities to increase the operational efficiency, spatial scale, speed of deployment and social inclusivity of reef restoration in many different contexts. Their examples represent valuable learning experiences, highlighting a range of mechanisms through which management and policy interventions might aim to increase the scale of coral reef restoration. By combining ecological, social and economic strategies in a multi-dimensional approach to scale-up, reef restoration can deliver more beneficial and equitable outcomes locally, regionally and globally.

AB  - Living shorelines are a type of estuarine shoreline erosion control that incorporates native vegetation and preserves native habitats. Because they provide the ecosystem services associated with natural coastal wetlands while also increasing shoreline resilience, living shorelines are part of the natural and hybrid infrastructure approach to coastal resiliency. Marshes created as living shorelines are typically narrow (< 30 m) fringing marshes with sandy substrates that are well flushed by tides. These characteristics distinguish living shorelines from the larger meadow marshes in which most of the current knowledge about created marshes was developed. The value of living shorelines for providing both erosion control and habitat for estuarine organisms has been documented but their capacity for carbon sequestration has not. We measured carbon sequestration rates in living shorelines and sandy transplanted Spartina alterniflora marshes in the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina. The marshes sampled here range in age from 12 to 38 years and represent a continuum of soil development. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 58 to 283 g C m-2 yr-1 and decreased with marsh age. The pattern of lower sequestration rates in older marshes is hypothesized to be the result of a relative enrichment of labile organic matter in younger sites and illustrates the importance of choosing mature marshes for determination of long-term carbon sequestration potential. The data presented here are within the range of published carbon sequestration rates for S. alterniflora marshes and suggest that wide-scale use of the living shoreline approach to shoreline management may come with a substantial carbon benefit.

AB  - Living shorelines are a shoreline stabilization strategy encompassing a range of vegetative to structural materials and serve as an alternative approach to the use of structures like bulkheads, which are known to aggravate erosion. Living shorelines are often installed with little to no long-term monitoring for effectiveness; specifically, there is a lack of quantitative data regarding their performance as a shoreline stabilization strategy. This study sought to assess the performance of living shorelines with sills, with respect to shoreline protection, by determining shoreline change rates (SCR) using geospatial analysis. Shoreline surveys were conducted using a real-time kinematic (RTK)-GPS unit at a total of 17 living shoreline projects and nine control segments at 12 sites along the coast of North Carolina. Current shoreline position was compared to historic (pre-installation) shoreline positions obtained from aerial imagery, dating to 1993. The average SCR among northern sites before installation was − 0.45 ± 0.49 m year−1, and in southern sites, it was − 0.21 ± 0.52 m year−1. After installation, average SCR was significantly less erosive at northern and southern sites with living shorelines, 0.17 ± 0.47 and − 0.01 ± 0.51 m year−1, respectively. Of the 17 living shoreline project segments, 12 exhibited a reduction in the rate of erosion; of those 12, six were observed to be accreting. This study supports the convention that living shorelines can reduce the rate of erosion and potentially restore lost shore zone habitat.

AB  - Living shoreline marshes are coastal wetlands constructed as alternatives to “hardened shorelines” (e.g., bulkheads, riprap) to mitigate erosion and to allow for landward migration of intertidal habitat as sea level rises. Living shorelines are designed to mimic natural fringing marshes and over time should be sinks for carbon and other nutrients. We collected soil cores and aboveground plant material from 13 pairs of natural fringing marshes and living shoreline marshes of different ages and degree of isolation from more extensive marsh shorescapes to compare nutrient pools and accrual. Although the nutrient content of plants was similar within and between marsh types, soil nutrients were variable from both living shorelines aged 2–16 years and long-established natural marshes. Most—but not all—living shoreline marshes had lower soil organic content, higher bulk density, and lower soil % carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus than their natural marsh pair. Variation in soil nutrients from living shorelines was not strongly correlated with either marsh age or degree of isolation in the estuarine shorescape. Assuming constant accrual within individual marshes, we estimated soil nutrient levels in living shorelines would approach those observed in their paired, natural fringing marshes over timescales from less than 10 years to many decades. Living shoreline marshes are on trajectories to match natural marsh function with respect to carbon and nutrient storage in estuarine systems.

AB  - Little information is available on the impacts of coastal reclamation on wetland loss in large-river deltas at a regional scale. Using remote sensing data of coastal wetland and reclamation in four deltas in China from 1978 to 2014, we tracked their continuous area changes in four periods: 1978–1990, 1990–2000, 2000–2008, and 2008–2014. The areal relation between wetland loss and reclamation was quantified and used to identify coastal reclamation mode intensity coupled with another three indicators: reclamation rate, accretion rate and land-use intensity of coastal reclamation. The results showed that coastal reclamation driven by economic development reduced, or even reverse the original growth of delta which was determined by the offset between wetland acceleration rate and wetland loss rate. Generally, the area of reclamation showed a positive linear correlation with the area of wetland loss. The findings imply that human activities should control reclamation rate and intensity to alleviate total wetland loss and maintain wetland ‘net gain’. Inappropriate coastal reclamation modes can magnify total wetland loss; therefore, coastal reclamation with a slow increment rate and low impervious surface percent is of great importance for sustainable development in future coastal management.

AB  - Land-use change in the coastal zone has led to worldwide degradation of marine coastal ecosystems and a loss of the goods and services they provide. Restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed and is critical for habitats where natural recovery is hindered. Uncertainties about restoration cost and feasibility can impede decisions on whether, what, how, where, and how much to restore. Here, we perform a synthesis of 235 studies with 954 observations from restoration or rehabilitation projects of coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, salt-marshes, and oyster reefs worldwide, and evaluate cost, survival of restored organisms, project duration, area, and techniques applied. Findings showed that while the median and average reported costs for restoration of one hectare of marine coastal habitat were around US$80000 (2010) and US$1600000 (2010), respectively, the real total costs (median) are likely to be two to four times higher. Coral reefs and seagrass were among the most expensive ecosystems to restore. Mangrove restoration projects were typically the largest and the least expensive per hectare. Most marine coastal restoration projects were conducted in Australia, Europe, and USA, while total restoration costs were significantly (up to 30 times) cheaper in countries with developing economies. Community- or volunteer-based marine restoration projects usually have lower costs. Median survival of restored marine and coastal organisms, often assessed only within the first one to two years after restoration, was highest for saltmarshes (64.8%) and coral reefs (64.5%) and lowest for seagrass (38.0%). However, success rates reported in the scientific literature could be biased towards publishing successes rather than failures. The majority of restoration projects were short-lived and seldom reported monitoring costs. Restoration success depended primarily on the ecosystem, site selection, and techniques applied rather than on money spent. We need enhanced investment in both improving restoration practices and large-scale restoration.

AB  - Land reclamation can impact a variety of ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands. The dynamics of coastal blue carbon storage (CBCS) altered by land use/land cover (LULC) transformation and its linkage with natural and anthropogenic driving processes was analyzed in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China. Using LULC data in the YRD during 1970-2010, the LULC transformation in four periods (i.e., 1970-1980, 1980-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000-2010) and their cumulative conversions within coastal wetlands were tracked to investigate the flow of LULC transformation. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the CBCS were then modeled and investigated by InVEST based on the LULC transformation in relation to their driving processes. The results indicated that the CBCS in the YRD has been substantially altered by continuous LULC transformation driven by the natural and anthropogenic processes, totally decreased by 10.2% (1.63 x 10(6) Mg) during 1970-2010 followed the loss of 2028 km(2) natural wetlands converted to socioeconomic land use. The 78% of increased CBCS were contributed by single natural (e.g., succession) or anthropogenic (e.g., restoration) driving process at the seaward edge within tidal area, whereas 71% of decreased CBCS was linked with multiple driving processes in inland areas. In addition, the anthropogenic driving processes caused much greater loss (-5.97 x 10(5) Mg) than gain (6.81 x 10(4) Mg) in CBCS, compared with a net gain of CBCS (1.04 x 10(4) Mg) brought by the natural driving processes. The study can facilitate to develop coastal management strategy to balance and mitigate the conflicted LULC between socioeconomic development and maintenance of multiple ecosystem services incorporating CBCS.

AB  - Jiangsu Province has the longest inland restricted waterway among all the provinces in China. Ecological revetment is the hot topic of current research on the river or channel regulation engineering in China. Evaluation of ecological restoration capability of revetment is an important part of revetment design as well as an effective basis of the revetment selection. Liudaxian channel of Jiangsu province is chosen for this study, an index system and method for evaluating of ecological restoration capability of revetment is established. By analyzing the mechanism and process of revetment impact on river ecosystems, indicators of ecological restoration capability and quantitative calculation method are proposed in revetment structure level. Based on the degree of influence of the indicator to river ecological function, instead of expert opinion, the set value iteration method was used to analyze the degree of influence of the indicator to river ecosystem, which made weight assignments objectively. Combining with gray relational analysis (GRA) method, the set value iteration based on ecological theory - gray correlation evaluation model was established, which achieved quantitative evaluation of the ecological restoration of revetment. The evaluating result of the projects shows that revetment of wood pile with ladder-sand tube + three-dimensional vegetation net is chosen as the recommended slope protection measure. The revetment ecological restoration evaluation model proposed in this paper with the advantages of objective, standardized and quantitative, offers an effective and feasible tool for designers and managers to evaluate the ecological restoration capability of revetment.

AB  - Jamaica, like most Small Island Developing States around the world, is at high risk of coastal hazards due to its exposure to tropical storms, high levels of coastal development, vulnerable coastal communities, and the predicted impacts of climate change. Environmental degradation has been linked to increased vulnerability to disasters. Nature-based Solutions, although not formally present in the literature, are being implemented at various scales in Jamaica. This paper presents an overview of three marine and coastal Nature-based Solutions being utilised in the country: protected area management (Special Fishery Conservation Areas); mangrove restoration; and coral restoration. The paper briefly reviews their current application in Jamaica before arguing that these conservation projects that traditionally focused on biodiversity have co-benefits as Nature-based Solutions for disaster resilience. The paper closes by outlining several research objectives that should be explored in the future to further the implementation of Nature-based Solutions for disaster resilience in Jamaica.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that human activities are contributing to substantial biodiversity loss and that this threatens ecological processes underpinning human exploitation of ‘ecosystem services’ (defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment as ‘the benefits people obtain from ecosystems’). In the present study we consider three ‘intermediate ecosystem services’ in both contemporary and ancient marine systems and although ‘ecosystem services’ per se did not exist in the Jurassic our study seeks to consider the future provision of these services and so the term is retained. We consider the temporal patterns in benthic marine ecosystems: (1) spanning four decades at two offshore stations in the North Sea, UK and (2) over millennial scales in Late Jurassic UK palaeocommunities. Biological traits analysis is used to link changes in taxonomic composition to variations in ecological functioning and the potential supply of three ‘intermediate’ ecosystem services: the ability to provide food to fish and other predators, benthic nutrient regeneration and carbon cycling. We examine whether changes in taxonomic composition drive temporal variation in functioning, whether this variation increases over time and the extent to which species turnover is comparable in contemporary and ancient systems. Taxonomic variability was of a similar magnitude in all three systems and there was evidence for changes in functioning linked to changes in several (key or rivet) taxa. During other periods resilience maintained functioning in the face of taxonomic change. These results suggest that in these benthic systems the Biodiversity–Ecosystem Functioning relationship is idiosyncratic, but a degree of temporal stability in functioning is maintained such that the ecosystem services they underpin would also be stable during decadal and longer-term changes.

AB  - It is presented a systematic literature review of artificial reef research, including 620 studies throughout the world from 1962 to 2018. The primary focus of this study was to examine long-term trends in research, focusing on ecological and socioeconomic questions, and to develop new research directions for this field. From 1962 to the beginning of the 1990s, the United States and Japan were the main centers of artificial reef research. Subsequently, researchers in several other countries (particularly China, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and the United Kingdom) began to focus on this subject, resulting in an increase in the number of artificial reef studies. In general, publications about artificial reefs have concentrated on investigating the structure of populations and marine communities and evaluating new technical designs and materials to construct artificial habitats. The science of artificial reefs is responding to new challenges with an increase in more elaborate techniques, such as the use of remotely-operated submarines, organic indicators, isotopes, and molecular biology, while research that evaluates the socioeconomic aspects of artificial reefs is lacking. There are many aspects that deserve more research attention, such as the use of alternative inert materials, environmental impact assessment and mitigation, and analysis of conflicts with affected fisheries communities. The greater challenge is to overcome the apparent division between theory vs. application and to include robust management models of these artificial environments.

AB  - Invasive species have become a major threat to ecosystem stability, diversity and sustainability in recent times. Invasive plants such as Spartina alterniflora (SA), outgrow resident flora by rapidly utilizing essential soil nutrients depriving the native plant species, impacting the ecosystem diversity and stability. SA is also notorious for its effect on local biodiversity as it grows and spreads faster, ultimately dominating local biodiversity. This dominance and the negative effect of invasive SA is due to features such as allochemical’s secretion, positive feedback between plant and soil, and rapid absorption of soil nutrients, exerting a competitive advantage over native plants. Therefore, in this review, we aim to contemplate the implications and potential applications of SA under control conditions or special circumstances as a source of biomass, soil restorer, CO2 capture agent, soil resilience enhancer and pollution remover as most of the studies on SA have focused on controlling its impact on the local ecosystem. On the other hand, SA's ability to grow quickly in poor alkaline soils is useful but very little is explored to exploit SA for biomass production in controlled cultivation in different environmental conditions. In addition to these aspects, the CO2 sequestration capability requires greater focus, especially in sensitive salt marshes and wetlands along the coastal areas.

AB  - Invasive species can positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the provision of ecosystem services. The direction and magnitude of this effect can be a function of the invaders’ density and the service(s) of interest. We assessed the density-dependent effect of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on three ecosystem services (plant diversity and community structure, shoreline stabilization, and carbon storage) in two oligohaline marshes within the North Carolina Coastal Reserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NCNERR), USA. Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (-0.40 ± 0.19 m yr-1 vs. -0.31 ± 0.10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy marsh of Kitty Hawk Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0.19 ± 0.05 m yr-1 vs. 0.12 ± 0.07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23.23 ± 2.0 kg C m-3 vs. 22.81 ± 3.8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36.63 ± 10.22 kg C m-3) than those with medium (13.99 ± 1.23 kg C m-3) or high density (21.61 ± 4.53 kg C m-3), but differences were not significant. These findings suggest an overall neutral density-dependent effect of Phragmites on three ecosystem services within two oligohaline marshes in different environmental settings within a protected reserve system. Moreover, the conceptual framework of this study can broadly inform an ecosystem services-based approach to invasive species management.

AB  - Intertidal oyster reefs in lower Delaware Bay are ephemeral and it is generally assumed that oyster mortality due to predation, disease and winter ice scouring inhibits their persistence. In June 2006, shell-bag oyster reefs of varying height were constructed on the intertidal sand flats in lower Delaware Bay, USA, to determine the potential for oyster reef restoration in this temperate estuary. Oyster settlement, mortality and recruitment were compared among reefs, as was habitat value for motile fauna. Oysters recruited shortly after reefs were constructed. Motile macrofauna immediately began using the reefs, increasing species richness and abundance relative to the adja- cent sand flat. Little post-settlement mortality was observed in oysters by October 2006 and most sur- vived exposure to snow and ice during winter. Shifting sediments nearly buried the shortest reef by April 2007, a process that may be more important in limiting the development of oyster reefs in this system than predation, disease or ice shear. Results indicate that there is good potential for the development of intertidal oyster reefs in this region.

AB  - Intertidal oyster reefs can protect estuarine shorelines from wave erosion and sea-level rise, and recognition of these ecosystem services has fueled global efforts to conserve and restore these reefs. Although intertidal oyster reefs are valued for attenuating wave erosion, little attention has been paid to the effects of wave exposure on their distribution. The present study characterized the role of wave exposure in determining the distribution of natural intertidal oyster reefs and of oysters on hardened shorelines (bulkhead and riprap revetments). Wave exposure was determined using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-developed Wave Exposure Model (WEMo), which integrates adjacent water depth, fetch, and processed wind information, among other variables. Field mapping of oyster reefs, defined as ≥10 oysters m−2, in Pamlico and Core sounds, North Carolina, USA, was conducted in summer 2014. Hardened shorelines and associated oyster densities were mapped for Pamlico Sound only. A narrow wave exposure threshold (~500 J m−1) was identified above which natural intertidal reefs did not occur and below which reef presence was apparently dependent on other structuring variables, such as salinity at the time of sampling and the grain size of surrounding sediments. Wave exposure was not correlated with the presence of oysters on hardened shorelines. The application of WEMo in the present study should be useful for selecting locations and materials for intertidal oyster reef restoration.

AB  - Intertidal mussel beds are important for intertidal ecosystems, because they feature a high taxonomic diversity and abundance of benthic organisms and are important foraging grounds for many avian species. After the introduction of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) into the European Wadden Sea, many mussel beds developed into oyster dominated bivalve beds. Despite the fact that oysters have been colonizing many European intertidal areas for about two decades, their impact on the ecosystem is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of oysters on the condition of mussels and on the spatial distribution of birds on 18 bivalve beds with different grades of oyster occurrence throughout the Dutch Wadden Sea. Moreover, in comparing bird densities on bivalve beds with densities expected on the total intertidal area, we could detect which species exhibit a preference for the structured habitat. Overall, 50 different bird species were observed on the beds, of which about half regularly frequent intertidal flats. Most of these species showed a preference for bivalve beds. The condition of mussels decreased with the oyster dominance, whereas the majority of bird species was not affected by the oyster occurrence. However, three of the four species that were negatively affected depend on intertidal mussels as food source. Even though the Pacific oyster is a nonnative species, attempts to fight it may do more harm to avian biodiversity than good.

AB  - Interest in the role that ecosystems play in reducing the impacts of coastal hazards has grown dramatically. Yet the magnitude and nature of their effects are highly context dependent, making it difficult to know under what conditions coastal habitats, such as saltmarshes, reefs, and forests, are likely to be effective for saving lives and protecting property. We operationalize the concept of natural and nature-based solutions for coastal protection by adopting an ecosystem services framework that propagates the outcome of a management action through ecosystems to societal benefits. We review the literature on the basis of the steps in this framework, considering not only the supply of coastal protection provided by ecosystems but also the demand for protective services from beneficiaries. We recommend further attention to (1) biophysical processes beyond wave attenuation, (2) the combined effects of multiple habitat types (e.g., reefs, vegetation), (3) marginal values and expected damage functions, and, in particular, (4) community dependence on ecosystems for coastal protection and co-benefits. We apply our approach to two case studies to illustrate how estimates of multiple benefits and losses can inform restoration and development decisions. Finally, we discuss frontiers for linking social, ecological, and physical science to advance natural and nature-based solutions to coastal protection.

AB  - Interest in mangrove rehabilitation has increased rapidly since 2003, as has awareness of the damaging effects of natural and anthropogenic pressures that contribute to mangrove loss, which is estimated at 1–2 % per annum. The major pressures are from urbanization and other development in all areas and forestry and fisheries especially where communities depend on mangroves for their livelihood. However rehabilitation success has been uncertain, reflecting gaps in integration between human and ecological components of the rehabilitation system. In particular there are government level issues of gaps and inconsistency in policy and failure in application. Some rehabilitation efforts have had limited success for several reasons including: having insufficient information, using inappropriate methods, not involving local communities, or not following all the steps in the processes that have been identified in the literature. A multi-disciplinary and integrated approach is needed to assist future planning and this needs capacity from a variety of areas in government, research and community. The review concludes with hope for a future where governments work with communities to develop policies and strategies for rehabilitating mangrove for resilience to changing environments.

AB  - Innovative solutions to improve the condition and resilience of ecosystems are needed to address societal challenges and pave the way towards a climate-resilient future. Nature-based solutions offer the potential to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems while providing multiple other benefits for health, the economy, society and the environment. However, the implementation of nature-based solutions stems from a discourse that is almost exclusively derived from a terrestrial and urban context and assumes that risk reduction is resolved locally. We argue that this position ignores the importance of complex ecological interactions across a range of temporal and spatial scales and misses the substantive contribution from marine ecosystems, which are notably absent from most climate mitigation and adaptation strategies that extend beyond coastal disaster management. Here, we consider the potential of sediment-dwelling fauna and flora to inform and support nature-based solutions, and how the ecology of benthic environments can enhance adaptation plans. We illustrate our thesis with examples of practice that are generating, or have the potential to deliver, transformative change and discuss where further innovation might be applied. Finally, we take a reflective look at the realized and potential capacity of benthic-based solutions to contribute to adaptation plans and offer our perspectives on the suitability and shortcomings of past achievements and the prospective rewards from sensible prioritization of future research. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB  - Indonesia’s coral reefs have been severely damaged by global and local stressors, and a range of active restoration techniques are now being used in attempts to rebuild degraded reefs. However, it is difficult to summarise Indonesia’s restoration efforts as a whole due to a lack of consistent reporting. Here, we first discuss Indonesia's legal policy framework concerning reef restoration; this is included in the agenda of two government ministries (Marine Affairs and Fisheries, and Environment and Forestry), and comprises national laws and governmental, presidential and ministerial regulations. We then provide an extensive review of reef restoration projects in Indonesia, documenting 533 records across the country between 1990 and 2020. Most (73%) of these records come from the past ten years, and many (42%) are reported in online news articles rather than scientific reports or papers. This review identified 120,483 units of artificial reef installed across Indonesia, along with 53,640 units of coral transplantation (including both coral nurseries and direct out-planting onto reefs); in total, 965,992 fragments of hard coral have been planted across Indonesia. The most favoured restoration materials are concrete (46%) and steel structures (24%). Projects are organised by a diverse range of governmental, NGO, private and community-led organisations. This review demonstrates that Indonesia’s policy has encouraged a diverse range of practitioners to implement reef restoration, but projects are often not coordinated with wider networks of restoration practitioners or scientists, and only 16% of the identified projects included a post-installation monitoring framework. Incorporating clear objectives and long-term monitoring programmes in project planning stages, while prioritising knowledge exchange and engagement with international scientific community, will substantially improve restoration outcomes in Indonesia. This will allow the country to fulfil its considerable potential as a global leader in rebuilding damaged coral reefs.

AB  - Increasing ocean temperatures have led to poleward range expansions of many marine organisms. The green porcelain crab, Petrolisthes armatus, was first reported on intertidal oyster reefs near Charleston, South Carolina in the mid-1990s, an expansion from its tropical to sub-tropical native range. In order to investigate the relative abundances of this introduced crab and a portion of the native crab community, resident crab assemblages were sampled on intertidal oyster reefs across four seasons from 2015 to 2016. Sampling occurred at five locations extending from Savannah, Georgia where P. armatus is now well-established, to Wilmington, North Carolina, where its inter-annual presence is intermittent. Petrolisthes armatus was the numerically dominant crab species at all locations except Wilmington, where the species was not collected in the winter. Differences between northern and southern sample locations in the taxonomic composition of crab assemblages were most pronounced in the summer (June–September) and fall (October–January), with dissimilarities largely attributed to high abundances of P. armatus at southern locations. Crab abundances of all species peaked in the summer and were lowest in the winter (February–March). Petrolisthes armatus was less abundant toward the northern range edge, whereas native crabs did not differ in abundance throughout the sampling range. Throughout the study area, adult P. armatus sex ratios shifted from unbiased or female-biased in the summer to male-biased in the fall. Adults were collected in the spring (April–June), indicating they had overwintered. While native crab densities (Panopeus herbstii, Eurypanopeus depressus) stayed relatively constant across locations, P. armatus densities varied greatly, suggesting that resources, such as shelter and food, are not limiting factors for the coexistence of these native and invading crabs.

AB  - Increases in the world population, sea level rise, and urbanization of coastal areas have put tremendous pressures on coastlines around the world. As a result, natural shoreline habitats are being replaced by seawalls and other hardened forms of coastal protection. Evidence shows that hardened shorelines can have a negative impact on the environment and surrounding habitat, leading to a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research aims to increase the different forms of coastal protection used throughout Sarasota County, Florida by conducting a geographic information system (GIS) suitability analysis for living shoreline treatment. Living shorelines or hybrid solutions are a more ecologically sustainable alternative to traditional forms of coastal protection, which use natural ecosystems or alternatively- structural organic and natural materials such as plantings, rocks, and oyster beds to stabilize shorelines and enhance shoreline habitat. The GIS model identifies coastlines that are 1) most suitable for living shoreline treatment, 2) most suitable for a hybrid solution, or 3) not suitable for living shorelines by analyzing the bathymetry, land use, land value, tree canopy, population, wave energy, shoreline sensitivity, and shoreline habitat. The suitability for living shoreline treatments was assessed independently for each parameter and assigned a value ranging from 0, areas that should consider using traditional methods of coastal protection to 3, shoreline segments most suitable for living shoreline treatment. The results from the individual analyses for each parameter were combined using a weighted overlay approach to determine general suitability for living shorelines within the study area. The result found that over 95% of the shoreline segments are potentially suitable for hybrid shoreline stabilization solutions.

AB  - Incorporating nature-based solutions (NBSs) into the built environment supports the ongoing sustainability challenge as emphasized in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has particular relevance for SDG Goal #11 (Sustainable cities and communities), which seeks greater efficiencies in urban planning and management practices that address aging infrastructure and ongoing air, water, and soil pollution. The short communications and research articles in this special series exemplify many of these aspects, highlighting the application of NBSs and showcasing the latest environmental research and policy solutions to support this. Nature-based solutions in the built environment aim to promote the understanding of the transdisciplinary nature of NBSs and enhance the global awareness of the value of NBSs by providing a diversity of solutions to illustrate the positive economic, social, and environmental benefits of NBSs in the built environment.

AB  - In this study, several macrobenthic diversity investigations were performed in Yangtze Estuary Oyster Reef, the largest artificial oyster reef in China, from 2012 to 2014. The sampling sites of the south branch showed considerably higher diversity than those of the north branch. The richness measures exhibited a significant increasing trend from low- to high-salinity zone; however, the evenness measures were typically high in the middle-salinity zone. During the past decade, the results were combined with historical data to detect the changes in macrobenthos. The variation in substrate organisms and macrobenthic diversity followed a steady trend after a major fluctuation. Redundancy analysis indicated that the water salinity and substrate factors were the main indicators that influence macrobenthic distribution. All sampling sites in the south branch were protected by a nature reserve. However, the N2 and N6 sites in the north branch were subjected to severe and mild human interventions, respectively.

AB  - In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), reefs built by eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, provide critical habitat within shallow estuaries, and recent efforts have focused on restoring reefs to benefit nekton and benthic macroinvertebrates. We compared nekton and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at historic, newly created ( 6 years) shell and rock substrate reefs. Using crab traps, gill-nets, otter trawls, cast nets, and benthic macroinvertebrate collectors, 20 shallow reefs (<5 m) in the northern GOM were sampled throughout the summer of 2011. We compared nekton and benthic assemblage abundance, diversity and composition across reef types. Except for benthic macroinvertebrate abundance, which was significantly higher on old rock reefs as compared to historic reefs, all reefs were similar to historic reefs, suggesting created reefs provide similar support of nekton and benthic assemblages as historic reefs. To determine refuge value of oyster structure for benthic macroinvertebrates compared to bare bottom, we tested preferences of juvenile crabs across depth and refuge complexity in the presence and absence of adult blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus). Juveniles were more likely to use deep water with predators present only when provided oyster structure. Provision of structural material to support and sustain development of benthic and mobile reef communities may be the most important factor in determining reef value to these assemblages, with biophysical characteristics related to reef location influencing assemblage patterns in areas with structure; if so, appropriately locating created reefs is critical.

AB  - In the Netherlands, the concept of a multifunctional dike has already often been implemented, and has been identified as a promising climate adaptation measure. In a multifunctional dike, functions like urban development, transport infrastructure, recreation, agriculture or nature are deliberately combined with its primary flood protection function. This means that the design must be based on the requirements and life span of all different functions, while in a monofunctional dike only the flood protection function is considered. By accommodating other functions, a multifunctional dike may easier fit into, or even contribute to the quality of the landscape. Moreover, these other functions may help in financing the flood protection works, but governance is more complicated. To avoid costly adjustments forthcoming from changed safety standards, incorporation of multiple functions can require a more “robust” flood defence than a monofunctional flood defence. A robust flood defence can withstand more extreme situations than required by the present safety standards, and has a substantially lower flooding probability. Therefore, a multifunctional dike may be attractive in view of the uncertainties regarding the effects of climate change and a changing world. Moreover, it will result in reduced flood risk. As part of the Dutch Delta programme, several explorative studies on multifunctional dikes were initiated. Most studies focused on urban areas, but also in the rural area interest emerged for multifunctional dikes, e.g. for the integration of salt marshes into the flood defences. Marshes provide valuable habitat for vegetation and invertebrate species, and are important for wading birds. Furthermore, under condition of abundant sediment availability they can keep pace with sea level rise. Explorative modelling results indicate that vegetated forelands affect wave heights, even under extreme conditions. However, the inclusion of a vegetated foreland into the dike design does not automatically mean that nature values and flood protection are well integrated. Flood protection imposes rather different requirements on the extent and features of marshes than nature conservation and development. Wave damping is most effective with a high and stable marsh, while nature thrives with dynamic processes and differences in elevation. Therefore, only a design that allows natural marsh dynamics and includes different marsh zones could combine nature values with flood protection. In practice, this means a dike design with an uncertain foreland, that offers space for natural processes. The uncertainty in foreland development reduces the possible flood risk reduction. In our paper we describe the critical points of interest concerning risk reduction in this system.

AB  - In the face of uncertainties around coastal management and climate change, coastal engineering interventions need to be able to adapt to changing conditions. Nature-based solutions and other non-traditional, integrated interventions are gaining traction. However, system-based views are not yet embedded into coastal management strategies. Moreover, the differences in coastal interventions, ranging from hard ('grey') to nature-based ('green') infrastructure remain understudied. In coastal management it is therefore challenging to work with the grey-green spectrum of interventions with clarity and focus, and to produce results that can be evaluated. The objective of this paper was to examine whether there is a common understanding of: the characteristics and differences between grey and green infrastructure, where interventions sit on this spectrum, and the resilience of grey versus green infrastructure. We conducted an integrative literature review of the grey-green spectrum of coastal infrastructure. We examined 105 coastal protection case studies and expanded the double-insurance framework to ensure an integrative approach, looking at both external and internal factors of resilience. Our review showed that external factors are typically used to characterise the grey-green spectrum. However, although useful, they do not facilitate a holistic comparison of alternative interventions. The additional consideration of internal factors (response diversity, multifunctionality, modularity and adaptive, participatory governance) bridges this gap. The review showed that dikes, reefs, saltmarshes, sand nourishment and dunes span a wider segment of the grey-green spectrum than they are generally categorised in. Furthermore, resilient solutions for adaptation are unlikely to be exclusively engineered or natural, but tend to be a mix of the two at different spatial scales (micro, meso, macro and mega). Our review therefore suggests that coastal planners benefit from a more diverse range of options when they consider the incorporation of grey and green interventions in the context of each spatial scale. We propose that internal resilience should be accounted for when infrastructure options are comparatively evaluated. This consideration brings attention to the ways in which the grey-hybrid-green spectrum of infrastructure enhances value for people.

AB  - In response to the environmental damage caused by urbanisation, nature-based solutions (NbS) are being implemented to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem processes with mutual benefits for society and nature. Although the field of NbS is flourishing, experiments in different geographic locations and environmental contexts have produced variable results, with knowledge particularly lacking for the subtidal zone. This study tested the effects of topographic complexity on colonising communities in subtidal habitats in two urban locations: (1) Plymouth, UK (northeast Atlantic) and (2) Tel Aviv, Israel (eastern Mediterranean coast) for 15- and 12-months, respectively. At each location, topographic complexity was manipulated using experimental tiles that were either flat or had 2.5 cm- or 5.0 cm-crevices and ridges. In Plymouth, biological complexity was also manipulated through seeding tiles with habitat-forming mussels. The effects of the manipulations on taxon and functional richness, and community composition were assessed at both locations, and in Plymouth the survival and size of seeded mussels and abundance and size of recruited mussels were also assessed. Effects of topographic complexity differed between locations. Topographic complexity did not influence richness or community composition in Plymouth, while in Tel Aviv, there were effects of complexity on community composition. In Plymouth, effects of biological complexity were found with mussel seeding reducing taxon richness, enhancing larger recruited mussels, and influencing community composition. Our results suggest the that outcomes of NbS experiments are context-dependent and highlight the risk of extrapolating the findings outside of the context in which they were tested.

AB  - In response to shoreline erosion and potentially more severe storm damage due to climate change and sea level rise, armouring of shorelines using traditional hard structures is likely to increase. An emerging alternative to seawalls and other hard structures is to create ‘living shorelines’ where natural habitats are incorporated into a resilient shoreline stabilization design. Research has shown that functional, multiuse living shorelines provide options for reducing erosion rates and sustaining shoreline stability while supporting intertidal and nearshore habitat. Drawing upon the scientific literature, shoreline management best practices, and the results from an expert opinion survey, we propose a spatial decision framework for multiclass suitability analysis of generic shoreline stabilization options with a focus on the unique challenges and opportunities of South Florida. The results have been incorporated into a web application that can facilitate decision-making in support of nature-based stabiliza...

AB  - In many coastal regions throughout the world, there is increasing pressure to harden shorelines to protect human infrastructures against sea level rise, storm surge, and erosion. This study examines waterbird community integrity in relation to shoreline hardening and land use characteristics at three geospatial scales: (1) the shoreline scale characterized by seven shoreline types: bulkhead, riprap, developed, natural marsh, Phragmites-dominated marsh, sandy beach, and forest; (2) the local subestuary landscape scale including land up to 500 m inland of the shoreline; and (3) the watershed scale >500 m from the shoreline. From 2010 to 2014, we conducted waterbird surveys along the shoreline and open water within 21 subestuaries throughout the Chesapeake Bay during two seasons to encompass post-breeding shorebirds and colonial waterbirds in late summer and migrating and wintering waterfowl in late fall. We employed an Index of Waterbird Community Integrity (IWCI) derived from mean abundance of individual waterbird species and scores of six key species attributes describing each species’ sensitivity to human disturbance, and then used this index to characterize communities in each subestuary and season. IWCI scores ranged from 14.3 to 19.7. Multivariate regression model selection showed that the local shoreline scale had the strongest influence on IWCI scores. At this scale, percent coverage of bulkhead and Phragmites along shorelines were the strongest predictors of IWCI, both with negative relationships. Recursive partitioning revealed that when subestuary shoreline coverage exceeded thresholds of approximately 5% Phragmites or 8% bulkhead, IWCI scores decreased. Our results indicate that development at the shoreline scale has an important effect on waterbird community integrity, and that shoreline hardening and invasive Phragmites each have a negative effect on waterbirds using subestuarine systems.

AB  - In macrotidal coastal ecosystems, spatial heterogeneity of the water column properties is induced by both oceanic and continental influences. Hydrodynamic processes generate a land-sea gradient of environmental conditions, affecting the biological performances of sedentary organisms. The aim of the present study is to establish an extensive spatial assessment in the reproductive investment of the wild Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Arcachon Bay. This is done by looking for a relationship between the Lawrence and Scott condition index (LSCI) and two tidal processes: the immersion level (IL) and the local oceanic flushing time (LoFt). The LSCI of C. gigas was assessed, just before gamete release, at 68 sampling stations in Arcachon Bay. Oyster performance was overall low and spatially variable. Significant differences in the LSCI were detected between the outer and inner bay. Oyster reefs located toward the mouth of the bay exhibited high LSCI (between 9 and 11), while oyster reefs located in inner bay, especially in south-eastern part around the Eyre River, had low LSCI (below 6). Linear modelling allowed to highlight significant effects of both tidal processes IL and LoFt on the obtained LSCI gradient. IL, LoFt explained 33% of the spatial variability observed on LSCI (IL = 3%; LoFt = 17%; LoFt + IL: 13%), 6% were attributed to the intra-station variation (ISv). Thus, high IL and rapid LoFt favor a better development of somatic-gonadal volume, probably because of longer feeding time and higher supply of food from the ocean by tide flows. Disentangling the effects of IL and LoFt on LSCI allowed to describe the spatial pattern in 61% of variability not explained by both tidal factors. A residual gradient directed southeast-northwest highlighted that others factors, independent from IL and LoFt seems to hamper inner bay oyster reproductive performance. Consequently, investigating on the ecological functioning (Eyre influences), trophic potential and anthropogenic pressures of this zone seem crucial on the understanding of C. gigas reproductive pattern in Arcachon Bay.

AB  - In developing countries, coastal protection with wooden piles may be a low-cost and eco-friendly countermeasure option that can be readily implemented by local communities or even individuals. However, the effectiveness of these piles in a realistic environment has yet to be scientifically proven, and there have been no established design guidelines for this type of improvised coastal protection to date. This study focuses on Phan Thiet City, Vietnam, where local people are resorting to wooden piles to mitigate severe coastal erosion immediately in front of their houses. A 3D hydrodynamic modelling with irregular waves is applied to evaluate complex wave mechanisms and hydrodynamics around and between wooden piles. The complicated interaction mechanisms between incident and reflected waves cannot be adequately evaluated using a common 2D numerical model or mathematical analysis, demonstrating the benefit of using a 3D hydrodynamic model. The performance of wooden piles are simply assessed using two criteria: wave run-up and bending stress. The result shows that wooden piles installed at a severely eroded beach in Vietnam can reduce wave run-up on the beach slope to some extent. The reduction in wave run-up occurs because of the creation of turbulence and oscillation triggered by the partial reflection of waves on the piles, diverting water flows into various directions. A case study shows that wave pressure in the seaward direction is about a half of that in the shoreward direction. However, the pressure in the negative direction can be instantaneously increased due to a significant reflection from a steep shore. This paper discusses whether such a state-of-the art computational fluid dynamics model can contribute to the assessment of wooden pile breakwaters.

AB  - In degraded landscapes, recolonization by pioneer vegetation is often halted by the presence of persistent environmental stress. When natural expansion does occur, it is commonly due to the momentary alleviation of a key environmental variable previously limiting new growth. Thus, studying the circumstances in which expansion occurs can inspire new restoration techniques, wherein vegetation establishment is provoked by emulating natural events through artificial means. Using the salt-marsh pioneer zone on tidal flats as a biogeomorphic model system, we explore how locally raised sediment bed forms, which are the result of natural (bio)geomorphic processes, enhance seedling establishment in an observational study. We then conduct a manipulative experiment designed to emulate these facilitative conditions in order to enable establishment on an uncolonized tidal flat. Here, we attempt to generate raised growth-promoting sediment bed forms using porous artificial structures. Flume experiments demonstrate how these structures produce a sheltered hydrodynamic environment in which suspended sediment and seeds preferentially settle. The application of these structures in the field led to the formation of stable, raised sediment platforms and the spontaneous recruitment of salt-marsh pioneers in the following growing season. These recruits were composed primarily of the annual pioneering Salicornia genus, with densities of up to 140 individuals/m2 within the structures, a 60-fold increase over ambient densities. Lower abundances of five other perennial species were found within structures that did not appear elsewhere in the pioneer zone. Furthermore, recruits grew to be on average three times greater in mass inside of the structures than in the neighboring ambient environment. The success of this restoration design may be attributed to the combination of three factors: (1) enhanced seed retention, (2) suppressed mortality, and (3) accelerated growth rates on the elevated surfaces generated by the artificial structures. We argue that restoration approaches similar to the one shown here, wherein the conditions for natural establishment are actively mimicked to promote vegetation development, may serve as promising tools in many biogeomorphic ecosystems, ranging from coastal to arid ecosystems.

AB  - In an era of rapid coastal population expansion and habitat degradation, restoration is becoming an increasingly important strategy for combating coastal habitat loss and maintaining ecosystem services. In particular, techniques that use habitat restoration alone or restoration in combination with built infrastructure to provide coastal protective services are growing in popularity. These novel approaches, often called living shorelines, have the potential to expand the reach and applicability of coastal restoration projects. To understand how living shorelines research has expanded over time, we conducted a scoping review of English-language peer-reviewed articles. We included papers that self-identified as living shorelines research, as well as studies that used other related terminology, to investigate trends in publication rates, geography, site characteristics, and outcomes measured. Using a systematic search protocol, we compiled a database of 46 papers; the earliest study was published in 1981, and the earliest study to use the term living shoreline was published in 2008. Eighty-three percent of studies were conducted in North America, followed by 11% in Asia, and 7% in Europe, but the use of the term living shoreline was almost exclusively restricted to North America. Saltmarshes, oyster reefs, mangroves, and freshwater vegetation were used in living shoreline designs, but 91% of studies also incorporated structural materials like oyster shell and rock. Most living shorelines research was conducted at sites that were less than five years old. The vast majority of studies exclusively reported on ecological outcomes (89%), and of those, ecological processes were measured in 74% of studies. Processes related to coastal protection were measured most frequently (52% of ecological studies), followed by biological interactions, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. All together, our data suggest that living shorelines research is on the rise, but there is a need for more long-term data, socio-economic research, further consensus on the terminology used to describe different types of projects, and research on the types of living shorelines that are most effective in different environmental contexts. Future long-term and interdisciplinary research will help to elucidate the full effects of living shorelines.

AB  - In an era of global change and rising sea levels, the capacity for inshore reefs to survive is increasingly unclear. We report on recent colonization of an inshore reef-flat environment at Sanya Bay, northern South China Sea, in shallow, muddy, eutrophic, and turbid conditions, which are widely viewed as marginal for sustained coral growth. U-Th dating of fossil Acropora substrate indicated that the reef flat has existed in a dormant state since 5,400years BP, with no vertical space available to accommodate coral expansion. Our surveys revealed that populations of free-living Porites compressa have recolonized the reef flat through asexual fragmentation, covering 13.91.3% of reef-flat substrates. Age-frequency analysis indicated that the majority (86%) of P.compressa colonies were less than 30years old. Analysis of long-term sea-level data indicated that recent recolonization of the reef flat occurred in response to a sea-level rise of 16.20.6cm over the past 30years (1987-2016). Modern sea-level rise at Sanya Bay appears to have turned on reef growth which has existed in a senescent turned off state for over five millennia. The asexual life history strategy of P.compressa colonies, which involves forming free-living colonies (coralliths), allows them to overcome turbid environmental conditions that are otherwise adverse to sexual recruitment. Our results provide novel insight into the response of marginal habitats to sea-level rise, and suggest that coral cover on degraded coral reef flats could increase under future sea-level rise, albeit with assemblages dominated by a few well-adapted species. Inshore coral reefs throughout the world are highly susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., increasing pollution and changing land use) and have declined in recent decades. Modern sea-level rises associated with global warming could theoretically increase accommodation space for corals growing on shallow reef flats. Whereas, the potential for degraded inshore coral reefs to respond to increased sea-level rise is as yet unclear. In this study, fringing reefs in Sanya Bay, a typical inshore reef system impacted by severe anthropogenic perturbations, provide a case study of disturbed inshore reefs response modern sea-level rise. With ecological surveys, coral demographic and age-frequency analyses, and high-precision U-Th dating, we provide evidence of a recent switch on of reef growth over the past 50years in response to rising sea levels that is unprecedented since the mid-Holocene. The unique life history strategy of the dominant coral taxa (free-living Porites) driving this partial recovery allows them to overcome highly turbid and eutrophic environmental conditions that have previously been considered adverse to recovery through sexual recruitment. Our results provide novel insight into the response of marginal habitats to sea-level rise, and a glimpse into a potential future condition, or new state, of heavily disturbed Indo-Pacific coral reefs.

AB  - In an era of coral reef decline, coral restoration is receiving increasing attention, with many recent developments in culture and transplant techniques. However, how the ecological processes operating on coral reefs influence the success of restoration efforts remains largely unexplored, particularly during the first months after outplanting which are considered crucial for colony survival. Herbivory is a key process well-known to maintain a coral-dominated state, and in the Caribbean Sea, the long-spine urchin Diadema antillarum is thought to aid coral success by removing algae from seafloor substrate that might otherwise outcompete coral outplants. In this study, we conducted a three-month manipulative experiment in southeastern Dominican Republic to test the effect of Diadema antillarum density on percent living tissue and growth rate of outplanted fragments of the critically endangered coral species Acropora cervicornis . Increasing herbivore density had no significant effect on coral survival or growth but did increase the percent of living tissue when urchin abundance was 3× ambient levels. The greatest growth and survival outcomes were instead related to the initial size of the outplanted coral and were reduced through predation by the fireworm Hermodice carunculata . Our results highlight the potential importance of considering ecological processes like herbivory and predation to maximize the success of ecological restoration .

AB  - In an abandoned shrimp pond, the spatial variability of the height of nipa ( Nypa fruticans Wurmb.) plants 5 years after their planting was evaluated to elucidate the determining factors for height. Soil properties were evaluated in 20 points in an area of 0.48 ha. Physical (e.g., hardness, water content) and chemical (e.g., pH and EC) properties were determined using surface soil samples collected at each point. Nipa height was moderately variable, showing a CV value of 31.2%. Soil conditions were considered to affect nipa height; therefore, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to elucidate the relationships among soil properties. As a result, three factors were extracted. PC1 correlated positively with relative ground level and Eh, and negatively with moisture. Because these properties were closely related to topography, PC1 was referred to as the topography factor. PC3 showed the second important contribution, a high K content contributed to a large nipa height. Multivariate analysis was also performed to examine the spatial property of nipa height (H), and as a result, the following equation was obtained: H = 423.94 - 0.39 x PC1 - 0.57 x PC3 (r 2 =0.53). Results of this study indicate that 53% of nipa height variation was explained by soil properties, which is larger than the nipa height variation explained solely by topography (23%). Site-specific management to regulate soil properties could be a practical strategy for nipa plantation.

AB  - In a marine environment that is rapidly changing due to anthropogenic activities and climate change, area-based management tools are often used to mitigate threats and conserve biodiversity. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are amongst the most widespread and recognized marine conservation tools worldwide, however, MPAs alone are inadequate to address the environmental crisis. The promotion of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) under draft Target 3 of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, i.e., conserving 30% of marine areas by 2030, holds promise to acknowledge sites and practices occurring beyond MPAs that contribute to conservation. Here, we evaluate the potential recognition of OECMs into Indonesia's national policy framework on marine resource management and provide the first-ever overview of distribution and types of potential marine OECMs in Indonesia, including a review of the existing evidence on conservation effectiveness. We identified > 390 potential marine OECMs, led by government, customary and local communities, or the private sector, towards diverse management objectives, including habitat protection, traditional/customary management, fisheries, tourism, or other purposes. While some evidence exists regarding the conservation effectiveness of these practices, the long-term impacts on biodiversity of all potential marine OECMs in Indonesia are unknown. Many OECM elements have been included in several national policies, yet there are no established mechanisms to identify, recognize and report sites as OECMs in Indonesia. We propose four transformational strategies for future OECM recognition in Indonesia, namely: (i) safeguard customary and traditional communities, (ii) leverage cross-sector and cross-scale collaboration, (iii) focus on delivering outcomes, and (iv) streamline legal frameworks. Our study shows that OECMs have the potential to play a significant role in underpinning marine area-based conservation in Indonesia, including supporting the Government of Indonesia in reaching national and international conservation targets and goals. • OECMs can be a complementary area-based conservation tool beyond MPAs in Indonesia. • Indonesia has > 390 potential marine OECMs, and many have been implemented for centuries. • OECM recognition in Indonesia will contribute to achieving area-based conservation targets. • OECMs in Indonesia can advance effective, inclusive, and equitable conservation. • Four transformational strategies to recognize OECMs in Indonesia are introduced.

AB  - In 2010 the Conference of the Parties (COP) for the Convention on Biological Diversity revised and updated a Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, which included the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Here a group of early career researchers mentored by senior scientists, convened as part of the 4th World Conference on Marine Biodiversity, reflects on the accomplishments and shortfalls under four of the Aichi Targets considered highly relevant to marine conservation: target 6 (sustainable fisheries), 11 (protection measures), 15 (ecosystem restoration and resilience) and 19 (knowledge, science and technology). We conclude that although progress has been made towards the targets, these have not been fully achieved for the marine environment by the 2020 deadline. The progress made, however, lays the foundations for further work beyond 2020 to work towards the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. We identify key priorities that must be addressed to better enable marine biodiversity conservation efforts moving forward.

AB  - In 2001, a hurricane moved a large sand dune, blocking the sole outlet channel of a mangrove. In the absence of daily tidal flow, the two ponds containing the mangrove vegetation evaporated, the secondary drainage channels were lost, and a salt crust formed on the bed of the ponds. The mangrove lost most of its trees and the remaining suffered from osmotic shock that led to defoliation. Restoration involved creating a knickpoint retreat (waterfall retreat effect) and tidal flow as a dredging mechanism to restore the outlet and form secondary channels in the ponds. During a very low tide, we deepened the mouth of the outlet channel by 1 m below high tide level to form a small waterfall when high tides receded. During successive tides, this one-step knickpoint deteriorated and formed a series of low rapids. With a steep gradient, the rapids retreated upstream into the ponds, first reopening the outlet channel and then carving new secondary channels in the pond mud flat. The excavation process of the outlet channel was repeated three times and was sufficient to effectively improve the hydrology of the entire pond system; allowing adequate flooding and draining of the mangrove ponds. Hydrology analysis tested by the Engelund–Hansen sediment transport formula established that the output of sediment from the ecosystem is greater than the input of sand into the mangroves. This is keeping the main channel continuously open. After eight years, tidal flow continues to keep the channels open; the salt crust has disappeared; the trees have recovered, and a large area of new vegetation has emerged.

AB  - Hydrodynamic forces from ships operating in sheltered, confined fairways can result in increased wave impact and sediment transport leading to loss of land and habitats. Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer the potential to mitigate ship-induced erosion and increase biodiversity and ecosystem services. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of NBS in a sheltered, confined fairway located in a cold, temperate region. The case study presents the results of a 2.5-year study of the morphologic response at two sites where NBS was implemented to mitigate bluff erosion and at one site where NBS was implemented to mitigate the retreat of a reed belt. Moreover, a qualitative assessment was made of the vegetation development at the sites. The results showed that fine sediments with planted vegetation could not withstand the hydrodynamic forces induced by the ships. However, by adding sills as stabilizing structures, the forces were sufficiently attenuated for the vegetation to establish. The vegetation, which reduced the ship-generated waves and currents, was especially important during high water-level events when the energy dissipation by the sill decreased. Moreover, a small-scale nourishment was successfully applied to mitigate bluff erosion without negatively affecting sediment supply to an adjacent sandy beach. This study demonstrates that NBS can be implemented to retain erodible sediment and favour vegetation growth in fairways experiencing primary and secondary waves produced by large, ocean-going ships. • Five prototypes of NBS at three sites were tested in full scale in a sheltered, confined coastal fairway. • The study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of NBS against ship-induced erosion at bluff escarpments and reed-belts. • The morphologic response, vegetation development, and durability of the implemented NBS were studied for 2.5 years. • A stone-based sill combined with vegetation was most effective in reducing bluff erosion and promoting reed growth.

AB  - Hydrodynamic differences among shorelines with no vegetation, reference vegetation (mature mangrove), and vegetation planted on restored shoreline (marsh grass and young mangrove) were compared based on field observations 6.5 years after living shoreline restoration. Mean current velocities and waves were more strongly attenuated in vegetation (from channel to shoreline: 80–98% velocity decrease and 35–36% wave height reduction) than in bare shoreline (36–72% velocity decrease, 7% wave height reduction, ANOVA: p < 0.001). Normalized turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates were significantly higher in reference vegetation (0.16 ± 0.03 m−1) than in restored (0.08 ± 0.02 m−1) or bare shoreline (0.02 ± 0.01 m−1, p < 0.001). Significant differences in the current attenuation and turbulence dissipation rates for the reference and planted vegetation are attributed to the observed differences in vegetation array and morphology. Although the hydrodynamic analyses did not suggest limitations to recruitment, mangrove seedlings were not observed in restored vegetation, while four recruited seedlings/m were counted in the reference vegetation. The lack of recruitment in the restored shoreline may suggest a lag in morphological habitat suitability (slope, sediment texture, organic matter content) after restoration. Although hydrodynamics suggest that the restored site should be functionally similar to a reference condition, thresholds in habitat suitability may emerge over longer timescales.

AB  - Hybrid shore protection projects combine hard structures with beaches, sand dunes and vegetation, mimicking the appearance and function of natural landforms. These advantages can also accrue to structures built as primary protection that eventually become covered by sand following natural accretion, artificial nourishment or burial by earth-moving equipment. This study reviews the advantages and disadvantages of dunes designed and built as hybrid structures using geotextiles, gabions and clay as core elements and dunes that eventually form over traditional beach protection structures that are built independently of a sand cover. Dunes constructed with hard cores can be considered soft solutions that overcome restrictions by regulatory agencies against hard shoreline armoring, but most hybrid designs are low-cost temporary solutions. Protection plans should also include subsequent protection actions that address long-term needs. Hard cores should be placed close to the human facilities to be protected to increase space for naturally functioning landforms and habitats seaward. Mechanical reburial of exhumed cores should occur as soon as possible to help prevent damage to them, reestablish habitat and aesthetic value, reestablish safe access between beach and upland for native fauna and beach users, and keep nature and the need for restoration in the minds of beach users. Keeping the fronting beach wider by artificially nourishing it can protect the structure from exhumation, provide a larger sand surface for dune buildup by aeolian processes and provide space for a more natural environmental gradient across the shore.

AB  - Hurricanes cause landscape-scale disturbances that affect biogeochemical cycling and water quality in coastal ecosystems. During Hurricane Irma’s passage through northern Florida, water movements driven by wind velocities up to 105 km h−1 caused a salinity peak in an estuary/blackwater river complex. Water quality was monitored across the 15 km site to detect the magnitude and duration of disturbance. Saline water intruded 15 km inland into a freshwater portion of the river that peaked at a salinity of 2 psu. Due to the volume of precipitation from the hurricane, significant runoff of freshwater and dissolved organic matter (DOM) caused a decrease in salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations while increasing turbidity and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM). The disturbance caused rapid changes observed by in-situ water quality monitors over a 3-week period, but some effects persisted for longer periods as shown by 3-month weekly water sampling. This disturbance caused shifts in DOM loading, altered salinity dynamics, and reshaped landscapes due to wind and wave surge both in upland marsh and downstream estuary. Hurricane disturbance temporarily and abruptly alters the aquatic continuum, and observations of system response can help us understand the mechanisms associated with ecosystem resilience and recovery.

AB  - Hurricane storm surge is one of the most costly natural hazards in the United States. Numerical modeling to predict and estimate hurricane surge flooding is currently widely used for research, planning, decision making, and emergency response. Land cover plays an important role in hurricane surge numerical modeling because of its impacts on the forcing (changes in wind momentum transfer to water column) and dissipation (bottom friction) mechanisms of storm surge. In this study, the hydrodynamic model ADCIRC was used to investigate predicted surge response in bays on the central and lower Texas coast using different land cover data sets: (1) Coastal Change Analysis Program for 1996, 2001, and 2006; (2) the National Land Cover Dataset for 1992, 2001, and 2006; and (3) the National Wetlands Inventory for 1993. Hypothetical storms were simulated with varying the storm track, forward speed, central pressure, and radius to maximum wind, totaling 140 simulations. Data set choice impacts the mean of maximum surges throughout the study area, and variability in the surge prediction due to land cover data set choice strongly depends on storm characteristics and geographical location of the bay in relation to storm track. Errors in surge estimation due to land cover choice are approximately 7% of the surge value, with change in surge prediction varying by as much as 1 m, depending on location and storm condition. Finally, the impact of land cover choice on the accuracy of simulating surges for Hurricane Bret in 1999 is evaluated.

AB  - Hurricane Isabel (2003) generated record flooding around Chesapeake Bay and caused extensive damage in rural Eastern Shore of Maryland and metropolitan cities like Baltimore. Regional atmosphere–ocean models are used to investigate the storm surge and coastal inundation that might be produced by a similar storm under the warmer ocean temperature and higher sea level projected for the future climate. Warming causes the storm to intensify, with the minimum sea level pressure decreasing from 955 mb during Isabel to ~ 950 mb in 2050 and ~ 940 mb in 2100. The stronger storm and higher mean sea level amplify the peak water level by ~ 0.5 m in 2050 and ~ 1.2 m in 2100. The total inundated area over Chesapeake Bay expands by 26% in 2050 and 47–62% in 2100. Over the rural Dorchester County, the inundated area shows moderate expansion in the future climate but the average inundation depth is 30% higher in 2050 and 50–70% higher in 2100. The number of houses flooded increases from 1420 during Hurricane Isabel to 1850/2190 in 2100 under the climate change scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5/8.5. The inundated area in Baltimore is 2.2 km2 during Hurricane Isabel, expands to 5.1 km2 in 2050, and reaches 8.1/9.1 km2 in 2100 under RCP 4.5/8.5. The estimated flood damage to Baltimore increases from $29 million in 2003 to $98/100 million in 2050 and $150/162 million in 2100 under the median projection of RCP 4.5/8.5. These estimates are subjected to uncertainty due to different climate change scenarios and different climate model projections.

AB  - Humans use the coastal ocean and its resources as a source of food and energy, as well as for a variety of other purposes, including transportation and recreation. Over the past several decades, uses of the coastal ocean have been increasingly accompanied by the installation of artificial structures. These artificial structures come in different shapes and sizes, ranging from energy and aquaculture infrastructure that incidentally form habitat for marine organisms to artificial reefs that are often deployed intentionally to become habitat. Marine spatial planning has offered a robust framework for siting artificial structures to minimize conflicts with other uses and maximize societal and economic benefits with other intended uses of the seascape, but ecological criteria are seldom considered in the planning process. In contrast, artificial reefs are intentionally sunk to form structured habitat and provide a variety of ecological functions, yet ecological principles are not often incorporated into the siting and planning process. Instead, artificial reefs are sited largely to advance societal and economic benefits and minimize conflicts with other uses, such as shipping traffic, military use, or impacts to sensitive areas. We outline a framework to further incorporate ecological principles into artificial reef siting, design and construction, and evaluation that features place-based and adaptive management coupled with tenets from experimental field ecology. This framework accounts for complexities of and interactions among ecological, societal, and economic criteria associated with artificial reefs to ensure they meet defined goals.

AB  - Human use and degradation of coastal ecosystems is at an all-time high. Thus, a current challenge for environmental management and research is moving beyond ecological definitions of success and integrating socioeconomic factors. Projects and studies with this aim, however, have focused primarily on monetary valuations of ecosystem functions, overlooking the behaviors and psycho-social motivations of environmental management. Using a nature-based salt marsh restoration project on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, we assess the role of human attitudes and preferences in evaluating social success for ecosystem management. We use structural equation modeling to compare the strengths of social variables in predicting restoration project support, and find public understanding to be a more important predictor than personal values. Our results show that even among stakeholders with strong pro-environmental values, a weak understanding of the management initiative can undermine support. We also find that project support does not necessarily translate to the prioritization of similar management strategies. Instead, when individuals consider overall management priorities, differences arise between particular resource user-groups. This suggests that strong public support for individual initiatives can misconstrue complexities in stakeholder preferences that emerge in more comprehensive management considerations. Future investigations of the psycho-social components of management solutions should address the potentially tiered nature of human preferences, as well as whether public perceptions of management effectiveness act as an additional context-dependency of social viability.

AB  - Human population growth and sea-level rise are increasing the demand for protection of coastal property against shoreline erosion. Living shorelines are designed to provide shoreline protection and are constructed or reinforced using natural elements. While living shorelines are gaining popularity with homeowners, their ability to provide ecological services (e.g., habitat provision and trophic transfer) is not well understood, and information is needed to improve coastal and resource management decision-making. We examined benthic community responses to living shorelines in two case-study subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay using a before-after control-impact study design. At Windy Hill, a bulkhead was removed and replaced by three tombolos, sand fill, and native marsh vegetation. At Lynnhaven, 25 m of eroding marsh shoreline was stabilized with coir logs, sand fill, and native marsh vegetation. Communities of large (> 3 mm) infauna adjacent to living shorelines at both locations tended to increase in biomass by the end of the study period. Community compositions changed significantly following living shoreline construction at Windy Hill, reflecting a trend toward higher density and biomass of large bivalves at living shorelines compared to pre-construction. Increasing trends in density and biomass of clams and simultaneously decreasing density and decreasing trends in biomass of polychaetes suggest a transition toward stable infaunal communities at living shorelines over time, though longer-term studies are warranted.

AB  - Human encroachment and development on coastlines have led to greater amounts of armoring of shorelines. Breakwaters are a common feature along coastlines, which are used to dampen wave energy and protect shorelines from flash floods or overwash events. Although common, their effects on sediment transport and marsh geomorphology are poorly understood. To address this gap, our study quantifies the effects of breakwaters on sediment transport and marsh evolution under different wave regimes using Delft3D-SWAN, a dynamic geomorphodynamic numerical model. Model configurations used the same numerical domain, but scenarios had different sediments, waves, tides, basin slopes and breakwater distances from the shoreline to explore how waves and tidal currents shape coastal margins. Model results suggested breakwaters were responsible for an average wave damping between 10–50%, proportional to the significant wave height across all modeled scenarios. Shear stress at the beginning of the marsh and the volume of sediment deposited at the end of the simulation (into the marsh behind the breakwater) increased on average between 20–40%, proportional to the slope and distance of the breakwater from the shoreline. Sediment trapping, defined as the ratio between the volume of sediment housed into the salt marsh behind and away from the breakwater, was found to be less than 1 from most model runs. Study results indicated that breakwaters are advantageous for wave breaking to protect shorelines from the wave’s energy, however, they might also be an obstacle for sediment transport, negatively affecting nourishment processes, and, consequently, impeded long-term salt marsh survival. Identifying a balance between waves dampening and shoreline nourishment should be considered in the design and implementation of these structures.

AB  - Human coastal occupation often leads to the degradation of the structural properties and environmental functions of natural coastlines. . Much research has been done on the cost-effectiveness of various living shorelines designs, however more work is needed for simple, small-scale designs that are typically adopted in waterfront residential or recreational properties. To contribute to this gap, we planted small-scale plots of black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) in two sites, one in a residential property and another one in a recreational property in the Northern Gulf of Mexico that experienced significant wave energy. Plots were planted at two different densities (50% or 100% initial cover) or left unplanted (controls) and, along with monitoring the evolution of the planted salt marsh, we measured a number of functional metrics including soil slope, abundance of nekton within and in front of the plots, and cover of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in front of the plots monthly over two years. In one of the sites plant cover decreased precipitously, and in the other site we did not observe any significant changes in plant cover over time (i.e. the initial 50% and 100% plantings remained at that level throughout the experiment) despite protecting the planted salt marsh with coir logs. We did not find any changes in soil slope or nekton abundance between planted and control plots. SAV growth was restrained in front of planted plots in relation to control plots, possibly due to deleterious impacts by the coir logs. Overall, the results suggest the protection against wave energy attained in this experiment is insufficient for adequate saltmarsh establishment and growth, thereby encountering decreasing or stationary plant density and no significant differences in soil slope or nekton abundance between planted and non-planted plots. Our results indicate the adoption of small-scale saltmarsh planting to reduce erosion and enhance coastal functionality needs to ensure that wave energy is sufficiently dampened for adequate saltmarsh growth and, concomitantly, the conceived saltmarsh protection mechanism does not negatively impact adjacent SAV.

AB  - Human alteration of land cover (e.g., urban and agricultural land use) and shoreline hardening (e.g., bulkheading and rip rap revetment) are intensifying due to increasing human populations and sea level rise. Fishes and crustaceans that are ecologically and economically valuable to coastal systems may be affected by these changes, but direct links between these stressors and faunal populations have been elusive at large spatial scales. We examined nearshore abundance patterns of 15 common taxa across gradients of urban and agricultural land cover as well as wetland and hardened shoreline in tributary subestuaries of the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Coastal Bays. We used a comprehensive landscape-scale study design that included 587 sites in 39 subestuaries. Our analyses indicate shoreline hardening has predominantly negative effects on estuarine fauna in water directly adjacent to the hardened shoreline and at the larger system-scale as cumulative hardened shoreline increased in the subestuary. In contrast, abundances of 12 of 15 species increased with the proportion of shoreline comprised of wetlands. Abundances of several species were also significantly related to watershed cropland cover, submerged aquatic vegetation, and total nitrogen, suggesting land-use-mediated effects on prey and refuge habitat. Specifically, abundances of four bottom-oriented species were negatively related to cropland cover, which is correlated with elevated nitrogen and reduced submerged and wetland vegetation in the receiving subestuary. These empirical relationships raise important considerations for conservation and management strategies in coastal environments.

AB  - Human activities have led to degradation of ecosystems globally. The lost ecosystem functions and services accumulate from the time of disturbance to the full recovery of the ecosystem and can be quantified as a \"recovery debt,\" providing a valuable tool to develop better restoration practices that accelerate recovery and limit losses. Here, we quantified the recovery of faunal biodiversity and abundance toward a predisturbed state following structural restoration of oyster habitats globally. We found that while restoration initiates a rapid increase in biodiversity and abundance of reef-associated species within 2 years, recovery rate then decreases substantially, leaving a global shortfall in recovery of 35% below a predisturbed state. While efficient restoration methods boost recovery and minimize recovery shortfalls, the time to full recovery is yet to be quantified. Therefore, potential future coastal development should weigh up not only the instantaneous damage to ecosystem functions but also the potential for generational loss of services.

AB  - Human activities and regional-scale climate variability drive changes in the ecology of coastal and marine ecosystems. Ecological restoration has emerged as a best-management practice to combat habitat degradation and restore lost ecological functions. However, relatively short project monitoring timeframes have limited our understanding of the effects of interannual climate cycles on water quality and restoration dynamics. We collected measurements on a 23-ha oyster reef constructed in the Gulf of Mexico to determine the relationship between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-driven climate variability and local salinity patterns, and to evaluate the effects of this climate variability and salinity on oyster population dynamics and faunal community composition over a medium-term (five-year) timeframe. The role of ENSO-driven climate variability on local salinity patterns (primarily from changes in precipitation and evaporation) and faunal dynamics was investigated using the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI). Salinity was negatively correlated with ONI with an approximately 4-month lag. Higher ONI values (El Nino periods) were followed by reductions in salinity, increases in oyster recruitment and density, and reductions in resident motile fauna density and species richness. Lower ONI values (La Nina periods) had higher and less variable salinities, and higher areal coverage of restoration substrates by large oysters. ENSO-driven salinity reductions in the second year after reef construction coincided with a shift in resident motile faunal community composition that was maintained despite a second strong salinity reduction in year 5. Our results indicate that it is important to expand the typical monitoring timeframes to at least five years so that resource managers and restoration practitioners can better understand how both short-term environmental variability and longer-term climate cycles can affect the outcomes of restoration actions.

AB  - Historic declines in oyster populations have resulted in diminished production of ecosystem services and habitat function in many estuaries. Due to the important role of oysters in ecosystem function, scientists and resource managers have employed oyster reef restoration to mitigate declines, recover essential ecosystem services, and better habitat function. Yet, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of restoration efforts on ecologically valuable mid-trophic level organisms inhabiting these systems. To address this knowledge gap, here we quantify macroinvertebrate species abundance, community diversity, and composition on experimental restored oyster reefs before and after restoration, and from live (positive control) and dead (negative control) reefs in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Species diversity and composition on restored reefs shifted towards states similar to live (positive control) reefs within 12 months of restoration. Recovery of species abundance occurred within 18 months of restoration. The results presented herein quantify the effect of restoration on resident macroinvertebrates and provide timelines of recovery for each attribute of these communities. Further, this study presents an actionable and transferable framework for identifying effective single-species metrics of restoration success across ecosystems. The application of this framework will provide managers and researchers with tools to improve the efficiency and efficacy of post-restoration monitoring. By doing so, this study contributes significantly to the improvement of broader restoration practices in an era of unprecedented habitat loss.

AB  - Here, we utilise a unique, 70-year-long (1949–2017), high-resolution historical aerial imagery dataset to track changes to coral reef structures in Bill’s Bay on the Ningaloo coast. Reef habitat was distinguished from sand and rubble substrates based on imagery greyscale values and autoclassified using unsupervised image analysis in ArcMap. This approach was validated through comparison of reef structure (defined by bathymetric LiDAR imagery), greyscale values of aerial photography taken during the same survey, and in-water ground-truthed photographs. Long-term (1990–2015) live coral cover data were then compared with changes in reef structure. Reef structure increased from 11 to 38% within Bill’s Bay between 1949 and 1990. A coral spawn-induced hypoxia event in 1989 caused a loss of live coral cover from 50 to 7%, a 25% reduction in reef structure by 2002, and a switch from branching to massive coral-dominated reef. From 2002, reef structure recovered and continued to expand, peaking at 41% of total area (2017). Live coral cover in 2015 (46%) matches this measured increase in reef structure, despite a drop in coral cover in 2008. Discrepancies observed between live coral cover and reef structure during the 2002–2010 period reflect the persistence of the massive dominated coral community and in situ dead reef framework. Across the entire study period, reef growth was most prominent along the south-western edge of the bay, possibly due to an increase in the availability of hard substrate for coral recruitment. This study provides new insights into reef health over decadal timescales by capturing changes in reef geomorphology that go beyond the spatial scale and scope of traditional in-water assessments. These data further highlight that coral reef structure in Bill’s Bay has expanded even with frequent natural disturbances affecting the region over the last 70 years.

AB  - Hazards in coastal ecosystems, such as flooding and land loss, demand natural and nature-based solutions from local communities due to the protective and non-protective services they provide when compared with traditionally engineered approaches. In this context, natural solutions are those that consider conserving existing habitats whereas nature-based solutions are those created by humans. These solutions support important coastal ecosystem functions, such as nutrient uptake, fisheries habitat, soil carbon storage, and surge attenuation. Our main research questions were: (1) Based on community engagement, what are the possible natural and nature-based solutions to address coastal hazards in Breton Sound Estuary, Louisiana? and (2) How do these community co-designed nature-based solutions support various ecosystem functions? To help answer these questions, we leveraged the competency group methodology to incorporate the local needs and traditional ecological knowledge of community stakeholders into collaborative ecosystem modelling. In total, fifteen members regularly met five times over an eight-month period to design nature-based solutions to address coastal hazards. Two nature-based solutions, created marshes and restored ridges, were identified most frequently by the competency group (>75% occurrence) in a final survey. Associated ecosystem functions of the identified solutions were assessed with simulation models to determine future ecosystem functions of nutrient uptake, fisheries habitat, soil carbon storage, and surge attenuation after 20 years. By adding created marshes to an ecosystem, our model results indicate slight increases in nutrient uptake, likely increases to fisheries habitat and soil carbon storage capacity, as well as storm surge attenuation in some areas following ridge restoration. Quantifying these ecosystem functions with management actions has been limited and is needed to assess how natural and nature-based solutions impact local communities and resource users. This novel approach to modeling ecosystem-based solutions through a collaborative modeling process with researchers and residents can be applied elsewhere to assess the viability of natural and nature-based solutions.

AB  - Habitats, such as coral reefs, can mitigate increasing flood damages through coastal protection services. We provide a fine-scale, national valuation of the flood risk reduction benefits of coral habitats to people, property, economies and infrastructure. Across 3,100 km of US coastline, the top-most 1 m of coral reefs prevents the 100-yr flood from growing by 23% (113 km2), avoiding flooding to 53,800 (62%) people, US$2.7 billion (90%) damage to buildings and US$2.6 billion (49%) in indirect economic effects. We estimate the hazard risk reduction benefits of US coral reefs to exceed US$1.8 billion annually. Many highly developed coastlines in Florida and Hawaii receive annual benefits of over US$10 million km–1, whereas US reefs critically reduce flooding of vulnerable populations. This quantification of spatial risk reduction can help to prioritize joint actions in flood management and environmental conservation, opening new opportunities to support reef management with hazard mitigation funding. A valuation of the flood risk reduction services of coral habitats to people, property, economies and infrastructure in the United States finds that these benefits exceed US$1.8 billion annually.

AB  - Habitat restoration efforts should integrate past trends, current status, expected climate change and coastal development impacts, remaining realistic opportunities, and resource management community capabilities. Integrating these concepts, a new target setting approach is being implemented in the Tampa Bay region with broad transferability potential. Past changes, as determined through a three-decade habitat change analysis and over forty years of habitat restoration experience in the region, has informed the new approach. It is also primarily focused on what is possible today and the projected needs for the future, rather than focusing on or attempting to replicate past ecological conditions. Likewise, this new paradigm accounts for persistent local and global stressors – especially watershed development, sea level rise, and climate change. As such, newly established numeric targets are “place-based,” meaning that they attempt to maximize the remaining restoration and conservation “opportunity areas” within the watershed. Lastly, the approach is comprehensive in that targets for the range of critical habitats, from subtidal to uplands, are now defined. This approach represents a general framework for addressing competing interests in planning for habitat restoration that could be applied in other coastal settings where sustainable urbanization practices are desired to co-exist with natural environments.

AB  - Habitat forming ecosystem engineers play critical roles in structuring coastal seascapes. Many ecosystem engineers, such as seagrasses and epifaunal bivalves, are known to have positive effects on sediment stability and increase coastal protection and ecosystem resilience. Others, such as bioturbating infaunal bivalves, may instead destabilize sediment. However, despite the common co-occurrence of seagrasses and bivalves in coastal seascapes, little is known of their combined effects on sediment dynamics. Here, we used wave flumes to compare sediment dynamics in monospecific and multispecific treatments of eelgrass, Zostera marina, and associated bivalves (infaunal Limecola balthica, infaunal Cerastoderma edule, epifaunal Magellana gigas) under a range of wave exposures. Eelgrass reduced bedload erosion rates by 25–50%, with digital elevation models indicating that eelgrass affected the sediment micro-bathymetry by decreasing surface roughness and ripple sizes. Effects of bivalves on sediment mobilization were species-specific; L. balthica reduced erosion by 25%, C. edule increased erosion by 40%, while M. gigas had little effect. Importantly, eelgrass modified the impacts of bivalves: the destabilizing effects of C. edule vanished in the presence of eelgrass, while we found positive additive effects of eelgrass and L. balthica on sediment stabilization and potential for mutual anchoring. Such interspecific interactions are likely relevant for habitat patch emergence and resilience to extreme wave conditions. In light of future climate scenarios where increasing storm frequency and wave exposure threaten coastal ecosystems, our results add a mechanistic understanding of sediment dynamics and interactions between ecosystem engineers, with relevance for management and conservation.

AB  - Growing coastal populations, rising sea levels, and likely increases in the frequency of major storm events will intensify coastal vulnerability in coming decades. Decisions regarding how and when to fortify estuarine shorelines against coastal hazards, such as erosion, flooding, and attendant property damages, rest largely in the hands of waterfront-property owners. Traditionally, hard engineered structures (e.g. bulkheads, revetments, seawalls) have been used to protect coastal properties, based on the assumption that these structures are durable and effective at preventing erosion. This study evaluates the validity of these assumptions by merging results from 689 surveys of waterfront-property owners in NC with empirical shoreline damage data collected along estuarine shorelines after Hurricanes Irene (2011) and Arthur (2014). The data show: 1) homeowners perceive bulkheads to be the most durable and effective at preventing erosion, but also the most costly; 2) compared to residents with revetments and natural shorelines, property owners with bulkheads reported double the price to repair hurricane damage to their property and four times the cost for annual shoreline maintenance; 3) 93% of evident post-hurricane shoreline damage was attributable to bulkheads or bulkhead hybrids and a higher proportion of surveyed homeowners with bulkheads reported having property damage from hurricanes; and, 4) shoreline hardening increased by 3.5% from 2011 to 2016 along 39 km of the Outer Banks. These results suggest that bulkheads are not meeting waterfront property-owner expectations despite continued use, and that nature-based coastal protection schemes may be able to more effectively align with homeowner needs.

AB  - Globally, there is growing interest in restoring previously widespread oyster reefs to reinstate key ecosystem services such as shoreline protection, fisheries productivity and water filtration. Yet, since peak expiration of oysters in the 1800s, significant and ongoing environmental change has occurred. Estuaries and coasts, are undergoing some of the highest rates of urbanisation, warming and ocean acidification on the planet, necessitating novel approaches to restoration. Here, we review key design considerations for oyster reef restoration projects that maximise the probability that they will meet biological and socio-economic goals not only under present-day conditions, but into the future. This includes selection of sites, and where required, substrates and oyster species and genotypes for seeding, not only on the basis of their present and future suitability in supporting oyster survival, growth and reproduction, but also based on their match to specific goals of ecosystem service delivery. Based on this review, we provide a road map of design considerations to maximise the success of future restoration projects.

AB  - Globally, there has been dedicated research on mangrove ecosystems, however, the modeling of wave-mangrove interaction is seldom considered in the operational wave prediction for vegetated coastlines. This review work apprises on the significant impact of mangroves on surface gravity wave characteristics. Prediction and quantification of wave attenuation characteristics by mangroves is an essential pre-requisite for coastal zone management activities along a mangrove dominated shoreline. Nevertheless, the dynamic impact of waves on mangroves is missing in the current regional wave forecasting systems. In this review article, the scientific advancements in wave-mangrove interaction studies are elucidated and focus on its significance in an operational wave modeling scheme for the Indian coast. The relevant studies on wave dissipation by mangroves and other vegetation; its nonlinear interaction in the presence of currents and extreme waves, and the need for improving its parameterization are considered distinctly. The study also highlights the importance to predict the futuristic scenarios of wave attenuation characteristics in mangrove dominated regions which are highly sensitive to effects from climate change. The authors believe that the research on dynamics of wave-mangrove interaction in India has an extensive scope, and possible future endeavors towards a realistic nearshore wave modeling along mangrove dominant coasts are presented in the concluding remarks.

AB  - Globally, erosion of muddy tropical coasts that are dominated by aquaculture ponds, is an increasing problem. Restoration of mangrove greenbelts may counteract such erosion, by restoring the sediment balance. Hence, we aim to unravel the processes controlling natural mangrove regeneration in both “landward” (i.e., into aquaculture ponds) and seaward direction, using the fast eroding coastline of Demak (Indonesia) as case study. Firstly, we investigated which physical and chemical factors drive landward mangrove expansion by relating them to the presence/absence of mangrove seedlings in abandoned aquaculture ponds. Secondly, we investigated which physical parameters control seaward mangrove expansion by relating them to expansion and retreat at the sea-side of mature mangrove stands. Landward mangrove expansion into abandoned aquaculture ponds was positively related to both emergence time (%) and sediment stability (i.e., shear strength), which are in turn both associated to bed level elevation and pond drainage. Surprisingly, there was no effect of soil chemistry. Seaward expansion of existing mangrove stands was strongly associated to foreshore morphology. Mangroves only expanded in the presence of an elevated mudflat, whereas the absence of a mudflat in combination with a concave (hollow) profile was associated with mangrove retreat. Our findings suggest that restoration of a mangrove greenbelt can be stimulated landward by improving drainage of abandoned aquaculture ponds. This enhances sediment stability and allows ponds to accrete. Seaward expansion can be induced by restoring foreshore morphology. Present results are discussed in the context of large-scale applications.

AB  - Globally, coastlines are under pressure as coastal human population growth and urbanization continues, while climatic change leads to stormier seas and rising tides. These trends create a strong and sustained demand for land reclamation and infrastructure protection in coastal areas, requiring engineered coastal defence structures such as sea walls. Here, we review the nature of ecological impacts of coastal structures on intertidal ecosystems, seek to understand the extent to which ecological engineering can mitigate these impacts, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation as a tool to contribute to conservation of intertidal habitats. By so doing, we identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future research. Coastal structures alter important physical, chemical and biological processes of intertidal habitats, and strongly impact community structure, inter-habitat linkages and ecosystem services while also driving habitat loss. Such impacts occur diffusely across localised sites but scale to significant regional and global levels. Recent advances in ecological engineering have focused on developing habitat complexity on coastal structures to increase biodiversity. ‘Soft’ engineering options maximise habitat complexity through inclusion of natural materials, species and processes, while simultaneously delivering engineering objectives such as coastal protection. Soft options additionally sustain multiple services, providing greater economic benefits for society, and resilience to climatic change. Currently however, a lack of inclusion and economic undervaluation of intertidal ecosystem services may undermine best practice in coastline management. Importantly, reviewed evidence shows mitigation and even restoration do not support intertidal communities or processes equivalent to pre-disturbance conditions. Crucially, an absence of comprehensive empirical baseline biodiversity data, or data comprising additional ecological parameters such as ecosystem functions and services, prohibits quantification of absolute and relative magnitudes of ecological impacts due to coastal structures or effectiveness of mitigation interventions. This knowledge deficit restricts evaluation of the potential of ecological engineering to contribute to conservation policies for intertidal habitats. To improve mitigation design and effectiveness, a greater focus on in-situ research is needed, requiring stronger and timely collaboration between government agencies, construction partners and research scientists.

AB  - Globally coastal habitats are experiencing degradation and threatening the production of critical ecosystem services such as shoreline stabilization, water filtration, and nursery grounds for marine fauna. To combat the loss of these ecosystem services, resource managers are actively restoring coastal habitats. This study compares samples collected from non-restored sites, sites restored in 2011, and sites that underwent restoration in 2019. Restoration sites are impacted wetlands with high elevation mounds that were leveled to increase the areal extent of intertidal habitats, enabling the recruitment of intertidal flora and fauna. Fyke nets were used to sample nekton within the upper intertidal zone. To quantify restoration success, nekton abundance, biomass, diversity, and indicator species were quantified. Sites restored in 2011 had a greater abundance compared to non-restored sites. Common snook, clown gobies, silversides, juvenile mullet, and Gulf killifishes were indicator species at successfully restored sites, while salinity, site type, and Secchi depth played important roles in predicting abundance and diversity. These findings are consistent with recent studies suggesting it can take years to see quantifiable differences in nekton communities following habitat restoration. Additionally, this work provides new insight regarding the benefits of restoring coastal wetland elevation to maximize intertidal habitat, thereby positively impacting nekton communities.

AB  - Global seascapes are increasingly modified to support high levels of human activity in the coastal zone. Modifications include the addition of defense structures and boating infrastructure, such as seawalls and marinas that replace natural habitats. Artificial structures support different macrofaunal communities to those found on natural rocky shores; however, little is known about differences in microbial community structure or function in urban seascapes. Understanding how artificial constructions in marine environments influence microbial communities is important as these assemblages contribute to many basic ecological processes. In this study, the bacterial communities of intertidal biofilms were compared between artificial structures (seawalls) and natural habitats (rocky shores) within Sydney Harbour. Plots were cleared on each type of habitat at eight locations. After 3 weeks the newly formed biofilm was sampled and the 16S rRNA gene sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform. To account for differences in orientation and substrate material between seawalls and rocky shores that might have influenced our survey, we also deployed recruitment blocks next to the habitats at all locations for 3 weeks and then sampled and sequenced their microbial communities. Intertidal bacterial community structure sampled from plots differed between seawalls and rocky shores, but when substrate material, age and orientation were kept constant (with recruitment blocks) then bacterial communities were similar in composition and structure among habitats. This suggests that changes in bacterial communities on seawalls are not related to environmental differences between locations, but may be related to other intrinsic factors that differ between the habitats such as orientation, complexity, or predation. This is one of the first comparisons of intertidal microbial communities on natural and artificial surfaces and illustrates substantial ecological differences with potential consequences for biofilm function and the recruitment of macrofauna.

AB  - Global environmental factors (e.g., extreme weather, climate action failure, natural disasters, human environmental damage) increasingly threaten coastal communities. Shorelines are often hardened (seawalls, bulkheads) to prevent flooding and erosion and protect coastal communities. However, hardened shorelines lead to environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. Developmental pressures that are growing in scale, scope, and complexity necessitate the development of sustainable solutions to work with, rather than against, nature. Such nature-based solutions (NBS) provide protection and improve environmental quality and enhance biodiversity. To further this pressing need into action, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began the Engineering With Nature (EWN) initiative to balance economic, environmental, and social benefits through collaboration with partners and stakeholders. This work shows how engineering practice can be advanced through structured decision-making and landscape architecture renderings that include ecological sciences and NBS into an integrated approach for enhancing biodiversity in coastal marine environments. This integrated approach can be applied when designing new infrastructure projects or modifying or repairing existing infrastructure. To help communicate designs incorporating NBS, drawings, and renderings showcasing EWN concepts can aid decision-making. Our experiences with implementing EWN in practice have revealed that involving landscape architects can play a crucial role in successful collaboration and lead to solutions that protect coastal communities while preserving or enhancing biodiversity.

AB  - Global declines of foundation species have reduced ecological function at population, community, and ecosystem levels. Restoration of foundation species promises to counter such losses, despite unknown recovery timelines, undefined benchmarks, and uncertainty about whether restored ecosystems approximate natural ones. Here, we demonstrate through a 15-year large-scale experiment in coastal Virginia, USA, that restored oyster reefs can quickly recover multiple ecological functions and match natural reefs. Specifically, abundances of oysters and a key crab mesopredator on restored reefs equaled reference reefs in approximately 6 years, indicating that restoration can initiate rapid, sustained recovery of foundation species and associated consumers. As reefs matured and accrued biomass, they became more temporally stable, suggesting that restoration can increase resilience and may stabilize those ecosystem processes that scale with foundation species biomass. Together, these results demonstrate that restoration can catalyze rapid recovery of imperiled coastal foundation species, reclaim lost community interactions, and help reverse decades of degradation.

AB  - Global declines in oyster reefs have resulted in reduced habitat heterogeneity, extent and quality for some coastal finfish, potentially reducing fish populations and catches. It is well established that habitat restoration results in higher finfish biomass and diversity where oyster reefs replace bare substrata. Therefore, restoring oyster reefs with a view to also improving fish stocks is often a key goal of oyster restoration. However, the principles of habitat quality, ecological connectivity and broader ecosystem management are poorly integrated within oyster reef restoration ecology, but such principles may be instructive in enhancing the benefits of projects on fish populations throughout estuarine seascapes. This manuscript presents a framework for projects seeking to restore both oyster reef habitat and finfish communities. Structurally and biologically complex oyster reefs, comprising both oysters and other invertebrates, are required to provide shelter, food and nursery services to fish. By carefully considering site selection at seascape scales (km to 10s of km), restoration can enhance the network of habitat available to fish and potentially increase the overall carrying capacity of the estuary. Managers of estuaries that now include restored oyster reefs should implement fisheries management plans and consider the effects of management actions broadly throughout catchments; failing to do so may jeopardize gains in fish yields. Management decisions must be adaptable, responding to key criteria in thorough monitoring programs. Integrating these ecological and coastal management concepts into oyster reef restoration will enhance outcomes for fishes and increase stakeholder engagement and cost‐effectiveness.

AB  - Given predicted increases in urbanization in tropical and subtropical regions, understanding the processes shaping urban coral reefs may be essential for anticipating future conservation challenges. We used a case study approach to identify unifying patterns of urban coral reefs and clarify the effects of urbanization on hard coral assemblages. Data were compiled from 11 cities throughout East and Southeast Asia, with particular focus on Singapore, Jakarta, Hong Kong, and Naha (Okinawa). Our review highlights several key characteristics of urban coral reefs, including “reef compression” (a decline in bathymetric range with increasing turbidity and decreasing water clarity over time and relative to shore), dominance by domed coral growth forms and low reef complexity, variable city-specific inshore-offshore gradients, early declines in coral cover with recent fluctuating periods of acute impacts and rapid recovery, and colonization of urban infrastructure by hard corals. We present hypotheses for urban reef community dynamics and discuss potential of ecological engineering for corals in urban areas.

AB  - Foundation species regulate communities by reducing environmental stress and providing habitat for other species. Successful restoration of biogenic habitats often depends on restoring foundation species at appropriate spatial scales within a suitable range of environmental conditions. An improved understanding of the relationship between restoration scale and environmental conditions has the potential to improve restoration outcomes for many biogenic habitats. Here, we identified and tested whether inundation/exposure stress and spatial scale (patch size) can interactively determine (1) survival and growth of a foundation species, Spartina alterniflora and (2) recruitment of supported fauna. We planted S. alterniflora and artificial mimics in large and small patches at elevations above and below local mean sea level (LMSL) and monitored plant survivorship and production, as well as faunal recruitment. In the first growing season, S. alterniflora plant survivorship and stem densities were greater above LMSL than below LMSL regardless of patch size, while stem height was greatest in small patches below LMSL. By the third growing season, S. alterniflora patch expansion was greater above LMSL than below LMSL, while stem densities were higher in large patches than small patches, regardless of location relative to LMSL. Unlike S. alterniflora, which was more productive above LMSL, sessile marine biota recruitment to mimic plants was higher in patches below LMSL than above LMSL. Our results highlight an ecological tradeoff at ~LMSL between foundation species restoration and faunal recruitment. Increasing patch size as inundation increases may offset this tradeoff and enhance resilience of restored marshes to sea-level rise.

AB  - For more than a century, coastal wetlands have been recognized for their ability to stabilize shorelines and protect coastal communities. However, this paradigm has recently been called into question by small-scale experimental evidence. Here, we conduct a literature review and a small meta-analysis of wave attenuation data, and we find overwhelming evidence in support of established theory. Our review suggests that mangrove and salt marsh vegetation afford context-dependent protection from erosion, storm surge, and potentially small tsunami waves. In biophysical models, field tests, and natural experiments, the presence of wetlands reduces wave heights, property damage, and human deaths. Meta-analysis of wave attenuation by vegetated and unvegetated wetland sites highlights the critical role of vegetation in attenuating waves. Although we find coastal wetland vegetation to be an effective shoreline buffer, wetlands cannot protect shorelines in all locations or scenarios; indeed large-scale regional erosion, river meandering, and large tsunami waves and storm surges can overwhelm the attenuation effect of vegetation. However, due to a nonlinear relationship between wave attenuation and wetland size, even small wetlands afford substantial protection from waves. Combining man-made structures with wetlands in ways that mimic nature is likely to increase coastal protection. Oyster domes, for example, can be used in combination with natural wetlands to protect shorelines and restore critical fishery habitat. Finally, coastal wetland vegetation modifies shorelines in ways (e.g. peat accretion) that increase shoreline integrity over long timescales and thus provides a lasting coastal adaptation measure that can protect shorelines against accelerated sea level rise and more frequent storm inundation. We conclude that the shoreline protection paradigm still stands, but that gaps remain in our knowledge about the mechanistic and context-dependent aspects of shoreline protection.

AB  - Food webs in urban estuaries support valuable ecosystem services that are subject to a wide range of stressors that can degrade the structure of trophic networks. Multiple trophic pathways stabilize food webs by providing complementary diet resources for consumers but the consequences of urbanization on estuarine food webs are relatively unknown. In estuarine creeks across an urban-to-suburban gradient, we demonstrate trophic decoupling of benthic and pelagic pathways, trophic niche contraction, and increasing human health risk arising with the same factors that are associated with ecological degradation. This suggests an urban estuarine paradox—human activities often create larger volumes of deep water habitat, yet human activities also render much of this area unproductive with measurable opportunity costs to food webs. Our findings emphasize the shared consequences of environmental degradation for the ecological integrity of urban estuaries and the health of urban communities that rely on estuaries for sustenance.

AB  - Florida's Big Bend region hosts the second largest concentration of breeding American Oystercatchers in the state, but reproductive success is low. Nest site characteristics and predation were examined to determine their influence on survival of nests and broods at two areas in the southern Big Bend (Cedar Key and Barge Canal). The probability of a nest surviving in Cedar Key was low (x̄ = 0.25, CI = 0.13–0.41) and limited by nest overwash (46% of known nest attempts); survival of nests at Barge Canal was much higher (x̄ = 0.45, CI = 0.31–0.58). However, 40% of chicks that survived to fledge (35 days) at Barge Canal died before reaching independence (60 days). Raccoon presence and hatch date were negatively correlated with brood survival at Barge Canal. Finally, chicks at Barge Canal weighed less and were smaller compared to chicks at an Atlantic Coast site, which may be related to low abundance of live oysters within 100 m of their nest sites. Efforts to enhance oystercatcher reproductive success may require different approaches for each site: habitat restoration to increase elevation of nest sites in Cedar Key and reduction of predators at Barge Canal.

AB  - Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide guidance in establishing the risk to structures and infrastructure in the coastal zone from storm surge and coincidental waves. The maps are used by state agencies and municipalities to help guide coastal planning and establish the minimum elevation standard for new or substantially improved structures. A summary of the methods used and results of 2012 FIRM mapping are presented for Charlestown, RI; a coastal community located along the exposed, southern shoreline of the state. Concerns with the methods used in the 2012 analysis are put in context with the National Research Council’s (NRC) 2009 review of the FEMA coastal mapping program. New mapping is then performed using state of the art, fully coupled surge and wave modeling and data analysis methods to address the concerns in the NRC review. The new maps and methodologies are in compliance with FEMA regulations and guidelines. The approach makes extensive use of the numerical modeling results from the recent US Army Corp of Engineers (USACE), North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS 2015). Revised flood maps are presented and compared with the 2012 FIRM map to provide insight into the differences. The new maps highlight the importance of developing better estimates of offshore surge dynamics and its coupling to waves, dune erosion based on local observations, and the advancement in nearshore mapping of waves in flood inundated areas by the use of state of the art, two-dimensional wave transformation models.

AB  - Facing the climate change and anthropogenic activities that have been discharging a large proportion of carbon dioxide CO2) into the atmosphere, wetlands stand out as an important sink for CO2 that is fixed in plant biomass and peatlands. Therefore, quantifying and monitoring wetland biomass is of great importance to preserve carbon stocks. This study aims to explore the potential of multispectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) derived from PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A sensors to estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB) and organic carbon in AGB (Corg) in the emergent vegetation of a palustrine wetland. We use correlation analysis and linear regression models to examine the relationships between spectral and biophysical variables and verify the best predictor spectral variables for AGB and Corg. Scirpus giganteus vegetation was sampled in the Banhado Grande wetland, in southern Brazil. The VIs were best correlated and preferred as predictor variables. The most accurate model used data from the PlanetScope sensor and VI of photochemical reflectance. Both sensors showed potential for pixel-based estimates of AGB and Corg due to their low RMSE values and their contribution as predictors of biophysical variables, which can contribute to opening new avenues in scientific research focusing on the management, monitoring, and conservation of marshes and your ecosystem service of carbon sink.

AB  - Facilitation cascades occur when a habitat-forming species facilitates another habitat-forming species with synergistic effects on biodiversity. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of facilitation cascades in marine environments, describing (1) the geographic distribution of studies documenting facilitation cascades; (2) the range of habitats and organisms involved; (3) the mechanisms underpinning their establishment; and (4) the sources of their spatial and temporal patterns and variability. We synthesize this knowledge to identify ways in which facilitation cascades could be integrated with other ecological theories regarding community assembly and function, and also to explore how they may be integrated into conservation and management strategies. Finally, we identify critical knowledge gaps and future research directions for improving our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the establishment and persistence of facilitation cascades in marine environments.

AB  - Faced with sea level rise and the intensification of extreme events, human populations living on the coasts are developing responses to address local situations. A synthesis of the literature on responses to coastal adaptation allows us to highlight different adaptation strategies. Here, we analyze these strategies according to the complexity of their implementation, both institutionally and technically. First, we distinguish two opposing paradigms – fighting against rising sea levels or adapting to new climatic conditions; and second, we observe the level of integrated management of the strategies. This typology allows a distinction between four archetypes with the most commonly associated governance modalities for each. We then underline the need for hybrid approaches and adaptation trajectories over time to take into account local socio-cultural, geographical, and climatic conditions as well as to integrate stakeholders in the design and implementation of responses. We show that dynamic and participatory policies can foster collective learning processes and enable the evolution of social values and behaviors. Finally, adaptation policies rely on knowledge and participatory engagement, multi-scalar governance, policy monitoring, and territorial solidarity. These conditions are especially relevant for densely populated areas that will be confronted with sea level rise, thus for coastal cities in particular.

AB  - Extreme events such as storm surges and tsunamis in combination with subsidence of densely populated coastal areas pose an increasing threat to millions of people in the tropics. Intertidal mangrove forests may form a natural protection against some extreme events, but have also widely been destroyed by coastal development. The establishment of mangroves and the maintenance of their stability over the short- to long-term requires an understanding of sedimentary processes and landforms in the coastal zone, making geomorphology a crucial, but sometimes neglected discipline when attempting restoration for disaster risk reduction. Mangrove geomorphic setting varies markedly across the tropics, depending on abiotic parameters such as suspended sediment supply and tidal range, with different restoration strategies suitable for each. In this study we provide a global categorization of mangrove geomorphic settings, based on the literature and global remote sensing data. The world's mangroves can be broadly defined as: (1) minerogenic and high tidal range; (2) minerogenic and low tidal range; and (3) organogenic and low tidal range. We further discuss restoration and management approaches most suitable for each geomorphic setting. Overall, this study can be used to inform managers about the relevance of geomorphic knowledge for successful mangrove restoration, how an understanding of geomorphology can influence site selection and restoration success, and how to match specific restoration methods to the prevailing geomorphic context. The stronger incorporation of geomorphic knowledge into site planning and design will improve the success rates of restoration for this important and globally threatened ecosystem.

AB  - Extensive efforts have been undertaken in the northern Gulf of Mexico to restore coastal wetlands that have been lost rapidly. The evaluation of these restorations mostly focused on individual-project scales. A modeling framework that can coherently synthesize multi-scale monitoring data and account for various uncertainties would improve quantitative evaluations at broader spatial scales needed for regional decision-making. We aim to develop such a framework to investigate the impact of different restoration methods (hydrological alteration, breakwater infrastructure, vegetative planting, or marsh creation using dredged materials) on wetland loss on the outermost mainland coastlines in Louisiana. We did this by implementing multi-level Bayesian models to predict areal wetland loss (1996–2005 before Hurricane Katrina) as a function of local geophysical variables (relative sea-level rise, wave height, tidal range) and a dummy variable indicating presence/absence of restoration. We assumed the effects of these variables varied by broader watershed scales. The restoration’s effect also depended on temporal scales of implementation. The results indicate the sites with hydrological alteration, when implemented for longer than 7 years, had significantly smaller areal wetland loss, compared to the reference sites controlled for the local geophysical variables, in the Chenier Plain watershed, but not in the lower Mississippi River watershed. The effects of the other restoration methods on wetland loss were not significant based on limited numbers of sites. The Bayesian modeling framework we developed can integrate monitoring data/key drivers across projects with uncertainties accounted for, it is adaptable, and presents a useful tool in restoration evaluations spatially and temporally.

AB  - Estuarine shorelines have been degraded since humans arrived in the coastal zone. In recent history, a major cause of habitat degradation has been the armoring of shorelines with vertical walls to protect property from erosive wave energy; however, a lack of practical alternatives that maintain or enhance ecological function has limited the options of waterfront residents and coastal zone managers. We experimentally investigated the habitat value of two configurations of submerged breakwaters constructed along an eroding shoreline in northwest Mobile Bay, AL (USA). Breakwaters comprised of bagged oyster shell or Reef Ball™ concrete domes were built by a community-based restoration effort. Post-deployment monitoring found that: bagged oyster breakwaters supported much higher densities of live ribbed mussels than Reef Ball breakwaters; both breakwater configurations supported increased species richness of juvenile and smaller fishes compared to controls; and that larger fishes did not appear to be affected by breakwater presence. Our study demonstrates that ecologically degraded shorelines can be augmented with small-scale breakwaters at reasonable cost and that these complex structures can serve as habitat for filter-feeding bivalves, mobile invertebrates, and young fishes. Understanding the degree to which these structures mitigate erosive wave energy and protect uplands will require a longer time frame than our 2-year-long study.

AB  - Estuarine environments worldwide are among the most threatened habitats due to increased disturbances resulting from coastal infrastructure and rising population densities. Boating activity is a primary disturbance, as it induces biological stress and morphological changes along the coastline. This high-energy environment that boat wakes create has resulted in loss of surrounding oyster reefs and salt marsh vegetation, ultimately leading to shoreline and habitat erosion. Here, we characterize the boat wake climate in the Intracoastal Waterway, assess the bathymetry in this heavily trafficked area, and anticipate the effects of experimental living shorelines (natural breakwall and oyster restoration structures) on facilitating sediment deposition and slowing vegetation retreat. Field observations indicate that boat wakes suspend nearshore sediment and can reach heights greater than 40 cm. A numerical stability model of the breakwalls suggests that the optimal porosity is field-specific. The desired porosity for minimizing lateral displacement is 0.50, while it is 0.18 for maximum energy dissipation, which indicates a need to further investigate this complex problem. These findings demonstrate that boat wakes significantly and regularly disturb estuarine shorelines and may be altering their bathymetry as well as suggest that the design of the breakwalls may be optimized to best counteract this pervasive disturbance.

AB  - Enteric methane emissions are the single largest source of direct greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in beef and dairy value chains and a substantial contributor to anthropogenic methane emissions globally. In late 2019, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) convened approximately 50 stakeholders representing research and production of seaweeds, animal feeds, dairy cattle, and beef and dairy foods to discuss challenges and opportunities associated with the use of seaweed-based ingredients to reduce enteric methane emissions. This Perspective article describes the considerations identified by the workshop participants and suggests next steps for the further development and evaluation of seaweed-based feed ingredients as enteric methane mitigants. Although numerous compounds derived from sources other than seaweed have been identified as having enteric methane mitigation potential, these mitigants are outside the scope of this article.

AB  - Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction has gained attention to complement or replace grey infrastructure. The paper explores ways in which ecosystems and green infrastructure (GI) are critical infrastructure in the context of disaster risk reduction to report respective losses in the Sendai Framework Monitor (SFM). We argue that reporting on GI under indicators D-4 and C-5 in the SFM represent an opportunity for tracking losses, yet do not provide direct information on progress made in reducing risk. Custom targets and indicators according to countries' needs within the SFM might be a more practical opportunity to report on both losses and progress.

AB  - Ecosystem-based approaches have proven effective and efficient in reducing disaster risks while ensuring continued benefits to people from ecosystem services. In this article, a new concept of Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR) for enhancing social-ecological resilience is proposed, based on analysis of several case studies. Field studies in developing countries such as Ghana and Myanmar have shown the benefits of Eco-DRR as implemented by local communities. These projects improve local livelihoods and social-ecological resilience. In Japan, after the massive damage from the 11 March 2011, Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami, ecosystem-based approaches were an important element of the national government’s DRR efforts. Analysis of these cases shows that Eco-DRR is a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable tool for DRR that creates new value for a region. It also shows the importance of multi-stakeholder participation in the process of promoting Eco-DRR. It is likely to become even more important in the future, as a means for addressing the increase in disasters resulting from climate and ecosystem change as well as demographic change. The contribution of Eco-DRR to maintaining and restoring ecosystems is particularly valuable for countries where there is reduced capacity for land management, as currently occurring in Japan due to rapid population decline and aging.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers typically exert positive feedback on their environment, which enhances their performance. Such positive feedback is lacking in the establishment phase, when densities are too low and/or patches are too small. There is a strong need to unravel the mechanisms for overcoming the resulting establishment thresholds, both for ecological restoration purposes and to be able to use their services. In the present study, we question whether providing a transient substratum can be used as tool to overcome establishment thresholds, by creating a window of opportunity for initial settlement, using mussels (Mytilus edulis) as a model system. Combining field and flume experiments, we study how biogenic substratum enrichment in the form of a shell layer on a soft mudflat affects the critical dislodgement thresholds and, thus, the chances of mussel establishment at different mussel densities and aggregation states. Flume results showed that the presence of a shell layer reduced dislodgement of mussel patches in low-energy environments but was conditional for establishment in high-energy environments. That is, in high-energy environments with shells, aggregation into clumps enhanced dislodgement, while dislodgement was reduced with increasing overall mussel biomass and overall mussel patch weight. Without shells, dislodgement was always 100%. These findings agreed with our field studies, which showed that coarse shell material reduced mussel losses (by a factor of 3), reduced aggregation (by a factor of 2.4), and increased attachment strength (by a factor of 2.4). Overall, our results show that the local presence of biogenic substratum increases the chance of mussel establishment by enhancing the critical hydrodynamic dislodgement threshold. Thus, the local addition of a biogenic substratum may create a window of opportunity to initiate settlement in more dynamic environments, to shift at a local scale from a bare mudflat state into an established biogenic reef state. Our findings have clear implications for how to approach restoration and management of ecosystem engineers dominated systems. For instance, when positive feedback of ecosystem engineers is lacking, (1) the transient offering of suitable settling substratum may be a necessary step to overcome establishment thresholds, and (2) this becomes increasingly important with increasing abiotic stress.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers that inhabit coastal and estuarine environments, such as reef building oysters, do not only stabilise the sediment within their reefs, but their influence might also extend far outside their reefs, affecting tidal flat morphology and protecting the surrounding soft-sediment environment against erosion. However, quantitative information is largely missing, and the spatially extended ecosystem engineering effects on the surrounding soft-sediment largely unstudied. To quantify this, we measured elevations around eleven natural Crassostrea gigas reefs occurring on tidal flats in the Oosterschelde estuary (the Netherlands). These tidal flats experience strong erosion as a consequence of human interventions in the system. Various reef sizes were chosen to test the proportional effects of reefs on tidal flat morphology. Measurements were used to create 3-dimensional surface maps to obtain properties of the reefs and the surrounding soft-sediment environment. The area of the oyster reefs ranged from 2 to 1,908 m2. Reef length varied between 1 and 61 m, reef width between 1 and 45 m, and reef height between 0.20 and 1.08 m. Reefs varied in shape, going from round shape structures to more elongated ones. We observed elevated areas (>5 cm elevation from the background intertidal slope) on the lee side of all reefs, caused by the interaction between the reef’s structure and locally prevailing wave conditions. The elevated area (i.e. the spatially extended ecosystem engineering effect) affected by the reef was of the same order of magnitude as the reef area. The elevated area was related to reef properties such as reef length, width, and height. Reef length, however, appeared to be the best predictor. These findings contribute to management solutions for coastal adaptation and protection. Our study clearly showed that oyster reefs not only protect the tidal flat under their footprint, but as well an area beyond the boundary of the reef.

AB  - Ecological engineering (EE) was employed for developing strategies for stabilizing eroded muddy coasts (EMCs). However, there was a limited analysis of these EE strategies with respect to design, performance, and lessons learned. This study employed a critical review for addressing the limitations. There were four EE models designed with different restoration interventions for stabilizing EMCs. The models using active interventions have not been cost-effective in controlling erosion because the interventions failed to achieve their goals or were costly and unnecessary. Of the two passive intervention models, the one with structures constructed from onshore proved to be more cost-effective in terms of construction costs, the survival rate of transplanted seedlings, and levels of sea mud accumulation. Interventions with adequate consideration of the muddy coastal ecological processes and the ecological reasoning for the positioning of these interventions play a crucial role in stabilizing EMCs. A passive restoration model using gradually expanded interventions should be promoted in order to ensure sustainable management of EMCs in the future.

AB  - Eastern oysters have been acknowledged for their important contribution to human well-being by providing goods and services including nitrogen removal from water bodies. In this study, we integrated daily environmental data (2008–2016) and filtration rate model parameter uncertainty to estimate nitrogen removal from denitrification and nitrogen burial services provided by the current extent of oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in Mobile Bay, Alabama. Oyster landing data (2008–2016) in the Bay were also used to estimate nitrogen removal through oyster harvest. A replacement cost method using an engineering solution from wastewater treatment plants was implemented to quantify the economic benefit of the nitrogen removal. The estimated total nitrogen removal services provided by oyster reefs in Mobile Bay was 34,911 ± 5,032 kg N yr−1 (mean ± 1sd), in which 22,095 ± 3,305 kg N yr−1 from denitrification, 11,047 ± 1,652 kg N yr−1 from burial of nitrogen into sediments and 1,769 ± 876 kg N yr−1 by oyster harvest. The mean economic benefit was $76,455 ± 11,020 yr−1 which was estimated as $73.2 ± 11.5 ha−1 yr−1. This method could be used for any time period to estimate the nitrogen removal service in Mobile Bay. With proper modification of model parameters, this method could also be used elsewhere to estimate nitrogen removal services provided by oysters.

AB  - Eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica are dominant ecosystem engineers that construct complex reefs in estuarine systems. Reef persistence relies on reef growth, which must outpace reef degradation and sediment deposition. The quantitative impact of burial on oyster survival and sublethal effects of sediment deposition are undefined. In this mesocosm study, we quantified effects of partial and complete burial (0, 50, 70, 90, and 110% of oyster shell height) on survival, biodeposition, condition index and growth of oysters (shell height = 25�75 mm). Survival only declined significantly when 90% or more of an oyster was buried; the critical burial depth inducing 50% mortality was 108%. This finding will allow scaling of mortality rates of oysters as a function of sediment load and oyster size. Biodeposition and condition index were negatively related to burial depth, whereas shell growth increased with burial depth. Decreases in biodepo- sition and condition index were likely related to disruption of feeding by burial and reallocation of energy resources to shell growth. The increase in shell growth was analogous to vertical migration of infaunal species—buried oysters increased vertical shell growth to breach the sediment surface to feed and respire, at the expense of tissue growth. While oysters are tolerant of partial burial in terms of survival, burial adversely affects metabolic processes that influence demographic rates and reef persistence. Future management efforts should consider the effects of partial burial, which often occur more frequently than catastrophic burial events causing mass mortality.

AB  - Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) habitat is increasingly being restored for the ecosystem services it provides rather than solely as a fishery resource. Community-based projects with the goal of ecological restoration have successfully constructed oyster reefs; however, the habitat benefits of these restoration efforts are usually not assessed or reported. In this study, we examined oyster habitat development at five community-based oyster restoration sites in South Carolina using oyster population parameters, resident fauna densities, and sedimentation (percent sediment coverage) as assessment metrics. All sites included multiple-aged reefs (1–3 years old) at the time of the fall 2004 sampling. Resident crabs and mussels were abundant at all five sites and crab assemblages were related to the size structure of the oyster microhabitat. Scorched mussel (Brachidontes exustus) abundances were most frequently correlated with oyster and other resident species abundances. Associations among oysters and resident crabs and mussels were not evident when analyses were conducted with higher level taxonomic groupings (e.g., total number of crabs, mussels, or oysters), indicating that species-level identifications improve our understanding of interactions among reef inhabitants and oyster populations. Community-based restoration sites in South Carolina provide habitat for mussels and resident crabs, in some cases in the absence of dense populations of relatively large oysters. Monitoring programs that neglect species-level identifications and counts of mussels and crabs may underestimate the successful habitat provision that can arise independent of large, dense oyster assemblages.

AB  - Due to rising sea levels and projected socio-economic change, global coastal flood risk is expected to increase in the future. To reduce this increase in risk, one option is to reduce the probability or magnitude of the hazard through the implementation of structural, Nature-based or hybrid adaptation measures. Nature-based Solutions in coastal areas have the potential to reduce impacts of climate change and can provide a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to structural measures. In this paper, we present the first global scale assessment of the benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation as a means of adaptation to future projections of change in coastal flood risk. In doing so, we extend the current knowledge on the economic feasibility of implementing global scale Nature-based Solutions. We show that globally foreshore vegetation can contribute to a large decrease in both absolute and relative flood risk (13% of present-day and 8.5% of future conditions in 2080 of global flood risk). Although this study gives a first proxy of the flood risk reduction benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation at the global scale, it shows promising results for including Nature-based and hybrid adaptation measures in coastal adaptation schemes.

AB  - Dramatic coral loss has significantly altered many Caribbean reefs, with potentially important consequences for the ecological functions and ecosystem services provided by reef systems. Many studies examine coral loss and its causes-and often presume a universal decline of ecosystem services with coral loss-rather than evaluating the range of possible outcomes for a diversity of ecosystem functions and services at reefs varying in coral cover. We evaluate 10 key ecosystem metrics, relating to a variety of different reef ecosystem functions and services, on 328 Caribbean reefs varying in coral cover. We focus on the range and variability of these metrics rather than on mean responses. In contrast to a prevailing paradigm, we document high variability for a variety of metrics, and for many the range of outcomes is not related to coral cover. We find numerous \"bright spots,\" where herbivorous fish biomass, density of large fishes, fishery value, and/or fish species richness are high, despite low coral cover. Although it remains critical to protect and restore corals, understanding variability in ecosystem metrics among low-coral reefs can facilitate the maintenance of reefs with sustained functions and services as we work to restore degraded systems. This framework can be applied to other ecosystems in the Anthropocene to better understand variance in ecosystem service outcomes and identify where and why bright spots exist.

AB  - Development of substrate organisms (oysters, barnacles) and the health of a monitored oyster reef were investigated in the Yangtze Estuary. Very low salinity suppressed oyster survival. Nevertheless, middle- to high-salinity significantly increased the abundance and biomass of substrate organisms, and macrobenthos species and diversity. Long-term variation in substrate organisms was steady after a major fluctuation, yet the macrobenthic community structure lagged behind that of oysters. Overall, the oyster reef was in a healthy state. The M-AMBI results showed that its ecological status under high-salinity was better than medium-salinity conditions. Redundancy analysis indicated these results were associated with changes in water salinity and substrate factors. Taken together, our results suggest this constructed intertidal oyster reef has had a positive effect on the community and health status of macrobenthos in the Yangtze Estuary. Further, these ecological benefits increased going from medium- to high-salinity waters, but were generally absent under low salinity.

AB  - Development in the southeastern US coastal plain generates the need for a better understanding of how survival and abundance of estuarine nekton respond to urbanization. Apparent survival and density of the dominant Atlantic coast salt marsh fish, the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, were estimated in four North Carolina tidal creeks using a model simultaneously fitted to mark-resight and mark-recapture data. Rates of weekly loss (mortality plus emigration) were high (~ 10%). Sampling for tagged fish within and outside of study creeks showed high site fidelity to each creek, indicating that loss largely resulted from mortality rather than emigration. Estimated rates of apparent survival were lowest in the creek with the least instream- and watershed-level impacts. This creek has direct (non-culvert) access downstream to a larger waterbody, suggesting that enhanced access by predators and/or greater rates of permanent emigration may have contributed to lower apparent survival in this creek. There was a positive relation between minnow trap catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and density allowing the relationship between CPUE and habitat and urbanization to be examined in a total of six creeks. The largest CPUE estimates occurred early in each growing season and were associated with creeks possessing characteristics most representative of undisturbed salt marsh mosaics: high percentage of marsh coverage instream and downstream and high percentage of marsh edge. Given generally limited movement outside of creeks, differences in abundance among creeks likely result from different levels of recruitment that are related to salt marsh availability. Priority preservation of salt marsh habitats may be warranted by natural resource planners to maintain abundance levels of this trophically important species.

AB  - Determining the magnitude of barrier-island geomorphologic change and response time to an increase in the rate of sea-level rise is important because sea-level rise is accelerating, many barriers islands are urban centers, and barriers buffer mainland shorelines and estuaries from ocean processes, especially during storms. Here, we show that Onslow Beach, NC, a sediment-starved transgressive barrier island located along a cuspate shoreline, had an immediate increase in apparent frequency and landward extent of washover deposition during the late nineteenth century increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. The evolution of the barrier at millennial to decadal time scales was reconstructed from sediment cores, radiocarbon dates, and remote sensing. Those data show that the oldest washover deposit preserved in the stratigraphy of the island is approximately AD 722 and at that time the island was seaward of its present location and an open-water lagoon separated it from the mainland. Barrier-island transgression progressed mainly through overwash processes and saltmarsh replaced the lagoon by AD 1500. During the nineteenth century, the number and landward extent of washover deposits increased abruptly along the island concurrently with a threefold increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. This was not a period of increased storminess in the Atlantic. Rather, the increase in number and landward extent of washover deposits is interpreted to have been caused by an increase in the rate of island transgression. The increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise, and possibly other contemporaneous mechanisms such as changes in wave climate, likely caused island narrowing through landward movement of the shoreline, lowered the elevation of the island principally through erosion of the dunes and made the island more vulnerable to overwash. These data suggest that transgressive barriers, especially those at the center of a coastal embayment, are extremely sensitive to increases in water level, which cause an abrupt decrease in resistance to overwash. The response of other barrier islands to accelerating sea-level rise may well be similarly rapid, but the degree of geomorphic change will vary depending on island morphology, rates of sediment supply, and physical processes.

AB  - Despite wide recognition of the multiple ecosystem services provided by mangroves, they continue to experience decline and degradation especially in the face of urbanization. Given the interplay between multiple resources and stakeholders in the fate of mangroves, mangrove management can be framed as a nexus challenge and nexus thinking used to identify potential solutions. Using the Klang Islands, Malaysia, as a case study site, this paper characterizes the mangrove nexus and stakeholders' visions for the future to identify potential options for future management. Through a series of stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions conducted over two years, results show that local communities can identify benefits from mangroves beyond the provisioning of goods and significant impacts to their lives from mangrove loss. While better protected and managed mangroves remained a central part of participants' visions for the islands, participants foresaw a limited future for fishing around the islands, preferring instead alternative livelihood opportunities such as eco-tourism. The network of influencers of the Klang Islands’ mangroves extends far beyond the local communities and many of these actors were part of the visions put forward. Stakeholders with a high interest in the mangroves typically have a low influence over their management and many high influence stakeholders (e.g. private sector actors) were missing from the engagement. Future nexus action should focus on integrating stakeholders and include deliberate and concerted engagement with high influence stakeholders while at the same time ensuring a platform for high interest/low influence groups. Fortifying existing plans to include mangroves more explicitly will also be essential. Lessons learnt from this study are highly relevant for coastal mangrove systems elsewhere in the Southeast Asian region.

AB  - Despite the disparities in size and volume of marine and freshwater realms, a strikingly similar number of species is found in each – with 15 150 Actinopterygian fishes in fresh water and 14 740 in the marine realm. Their ecological and societal values are widely recognized yet many marine and freshwater fishes increasingly risk local, regional or global extinction. The prevailing threats in aquatic systems are habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, pollution, over-exploitation and climate change. Unpredictable synergies with climate change greatly complicate the impacts of other stressors that threaten many marine and freshwater fishes. Isolated and fragmented habitats typically present the most challenging environments for small, specialized freshwater and marine fishes, whereas overfishing is by far the greatest threat to larger marine and freshwater species. Species that migrate within or between freshwater and marine realms may face high catchability in predictable migration bottlenecks, and degradation of breeding habitat, feeding habitat or the intervening migration corridors. Conservation reserves are vital to protect species-rich habitats, important radiations, and threatened endemic species. Integration of processes that connect terrestrial, freshwater and marine protected areas promises more effective conservation outcomes than disconnected reserves. Diadromous species in particular require more attention in aquatic restoration and conservation planning across disparate government agencies. Human activities and stressors that increasingly threaten freshwater and marine fishes must be curbed to avoid a wave of extinctions. Freshwater recovery programmes range from plans for individual species to recovery of entire basin faunas. Reducing risks to threatened marine species in coastal habitats also requires conservation actions at multiple scales. Most of the world's larger economically important fisheries are relatively well-monitored and well-managed but there are urgent needs to curb fishing mortality and minimize catch of the most endangered species in both realms.

AB  - Despite nearly a century of exploitation and scientific study, predicting growth and mortality rates of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) as a means to inform local harvest and management activities remains difficult. Ensuring that models reflect local population responses to varying salinity and temperature combinations requires locally appropriate models. Using long-term (1988 to 2015) monitoring data from Louisiana's public oyster reefs, we develop regionally specific models of temperature- and salinity-driven mortality (sack oysters only) and growth for spat ( 75 mm) oyster size classes. The results demonstrate that the optimal combination of temperature and salinity where Louisiana oysters experience reduced mortality and fast growth rates is skewed toward lower salinities and higher water temperatures than previous models have suggested. Outside of that optimal range, oysters are commonly exposed to combinations of temperature and salinity that are correlated with high mortality and reduced growth. How these combinations affect growth, and to a lesser degree mortality, appears to be size class dependent. Given current climate predictions for the region and ongoing large-scale restoration activities in coastal Louisiana, the growth and mortality models are a critical step toward ensuring sustainable oyster reefs for long-term harvest and continued delivery of the ecological services in a changing environment.

AB  - Despite its widespread use, the ecological effects of shoreline armoring are poorly synthesized and difficult to generalize across soft sediment environments and structure types. We developed a conceptual model that scales predicted ecological effects of shore-parallel armoring based on two axes: engineering purpose of structure (reduce/slow velocities or prevent/stop flow of waves and currents) and hydrodynamic energy (e.g., tides, currents, waves) of soft sediment environments. We predicted greater ecological impacts for structures intended to stop as opposed to slow water flow and with increasing hydrodynamic energy of the environment. We evaluated our predictions with a literature review of effects of shoreline armoring for six possible ecological responses (habitat distribution, species assemblages, trophic structure, nutrient cycling, productivity, and connectivity). The majority of studies were in low-energy environments (51 of 88), and a preponderance addressed changes in two ecological responses associated with armoring: habitat distribution and species assemblages. Across the 207 armoring effects studied, 71% were significantly negative, 22% were significantly positive, and 7% reported no significant difference. Ecological responses varied with engineering purpose of structures, with a higher frequency of negative responses for structures designed to stop water flow within a given hydrodynamic energy level. Comparisons across the hydrodynamic energy axis were less clear-cut, but negative responses prevailed (>78%) in high-energy environments. These results suggest that generalizations of ecological responses to armoring across a range of environmental contexts are possible and that the proposed conceptual model is useful for generating predictions of the direction and relative ecological impacts of shoreline armoring in soft sediment ecosystems.

AB  - Decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure in all major basins globally has focused attention on its importance as hard substratum on continental shelf and slope habitats. Observational studies are needed to improve understanding of faunal assemblages supported by offshore infrastructure and better predict the effect of removal. Here we present results from visual inspection and physical sampling of a small oil and gas industry structure decommissioned from an oil field in the North East Atlantic. This is supported by observations of similar structures nearby and by photographs of the surrounding seabed from environmental baseline surveys. The structure supported a reasonably high biomass and diversity of invertebrates (>10 kg and > 39 macrofaunal and 17 megafaunal species) and fishes (>20 kg biomass and > 4 species). The invertebrate megafaunal species present on the structure were a sub-set of the hard substratum fauna observed on surrounding seabed. Porifera were absent from the structure. Biological succession in the first two years occurred as follows. Sparse colonies of the hydroid Obelia sp. stet were early colonisers then subsequent development of thick hydroid turf (Obelia sp. stet. and Halecium sp. stet.) supported a diverse invertebrate assemblage (2654 individuals kg wet mass-1) dominated by saddle oysters (Pododesmus squama (Gmelin, 1791) and Heteranomia sp. stet.)) and scale worms (Hormothoe spp.). Percentage cover of hydroid turf varied significantly over the structure, with most growth on sections exposed to strongest currents. Commercially important fish species present around the structure included Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod), Pollachius virens (saithe) and Lophius piscatorius (monkfish). Studies of artificial structures such as this provide much needed data to understand their role in the ecology of seafloor habitats and inform environmental decision making on all stages of industry from exploration to decommissioning. We show that the ecological role of the decommissioned three-dimensional structures was to enhance the biomass of a sub-set of epifaunal invertebrates found in the area. This supported diverse associated macrofaunal organisms, providing a food source for motile invertebrates and fishes in an area where background hard substratum can be lost through the impacts of drilling.

AB  - Current plans for US Gulf Coast wetland restoration assume that wetlands can save lives and property by reducing storm surges. However, there have been few economic valuations of this benefit for Gulf Coast wetlands. We develop a methodology for estimating the value of wetlands in reducing expected property damages from hurricane flooding that relates damages to the distribution of storm events and incorporates both the wetland characteristics of wave attenuation and offshore storm surge properties. We apply this methodology to value the storm surge protection service of coastal marshes, in terms of reducing expected property damages, along the path of a storm south-east Louisiana, which includes New Orleans. We conclude by discussing the implications of this analysis for further research on the economic value of wetlands in protecting coastal property and for restoration policy.

AB  - Current approaches for obtaining shoreline change rates suffer from inability to give a specialist interpretation of the numerical results represented by velocities (m/yr). This study proposes a fuzzy model for coastal zone human impact classification that integrates shoreline changes, NDVI, and settlement influences to enhance numerical-linguistic fuzzy classification through Geographical Information System (GIS)'s graphical visualization prowess. The model output representing scores are numbers ranging from zero to one, which are convertible into fuzzy linguistic classification variables; i.e., low, moderate, and high on the one hand. On the other hand, use of GIS through NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) provides enhancement through graphic visualization. Using Itamaraca Island in Brazil as an example, multi-temporal satellite images are processed to provide all the required input variables. The resulting output divides the entire island into five sectors representing both quantitative and qualitative outcomes (i.e., fuzzy classification composed of both scores and maps), showcasing the capability of the proposed approach to complement shoreline change analysis through physical (map) interpretation in addition to the frequently used numbers. The proposed fuzzy model is validated using random in-situ samples and high resolution image data that has been classified by a coastal geomorphology specialist. The accuracy of the interpretation show 81% of matches are achievable compared to the results of the fuzzy model. The final results delivered by the proposed fuzzy approach show the complex behavior of the local dynamics, thereby adding useful and substantial information for environmental issues and Integrated Coastal Zone Management.

AB  - Culture of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is rapidly expanding. Combined with their continuing role as an environmental sentinel species and ecological model, this trend necessitates improved molecular tools for breeding and selection, as well as population assessment and genetic conservation. Here, we describe the development and validation of two panels of 58 single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) for the species. Population analyses revealed three distinct populations, based on FST values and STRUCTURE, among wild oysters sampled from Delaware Bay (1), northwest Florida (2), Alabama (2), Louisiana (2), and the Texas Gulf Coast (3), consistent with previous microsatellite and mtDNA analyses. In addition, utilizing the developed panels for parentage assignment in cultured oysters (Rutgers, New Jersey) resulted in a highly accurate identification of parent pairs (99.37%). The SNP markers could, furthermore, clearly discriminate between hatchery stocks and wild-sourced individuals. The developed SNP panels may serve as an important tool for more rapid and affordable genetic analyses in eastern oyster.

AB  - Crassostrea virginica, the eastern oyster, is a native foundational species that inhabits coastal and estuarine ecosystems along the western Atlantic seaboard. Introduction of C. virginica into estuarine areas with limited or no extant populations is gaining popularity as a pro‐active approach for improving estuarine water quality and creating natural wave breaks for shoreline stabilization. Adult oysters, grown by 113 community members under their private docks, were collected and deployed at three county‐owned sites along the Indian River Lagoon within Brevard County, Florida. In this shallow, warm‐water estuary, replicate treatments deployed at each site included bagged adult oysters collected from gardeners in fall 2014, bagged adult oysters from spring 2015 gardeners, bagged blank (clean) shell, and empty plots (control). Prior to deployment, morphometric data (shell length, weight) were collected on all gardened oysters. Morphometric data were then collected quarterly for all surviving and recruited oysters for 18 months. Our monitoring timeframe was sufficient for assessing survival of gardened oysters, but likely not sufficient to understand recruitment patterns. In areas with no recruitment and limited gardened oyster survival, regular enhancement with live oysters would be needed for long‐term success. In areas with natural recruitment, the blank shell treatment was most successful. Lessons learned from this study include: (1) need for better tracking of abiotic variables (e.g. salinity) where gardening occurred, (2) role of seasonality in initial post‐deployment survival, even in a warm‐water estuary, and (3) importance of pilot studies prior to large‐scale gardened oyster deployments.

AB  - Corals create complex reef structures that provide both habitat and food for many fish species. Because of numerous natural and anthropogenic threats, many coral reefs are currently being degraded, endangering the fish assemblages they support. Coral reef restoration, an active ecological management tool, may help reverse some of the current trends in reef degradation through the transplantation of stony corals. Although restoration techniques have been extensively reviewed in relation to coral survival, our understanding of the effects of adding live coral cover and complexity on fishes is in its infancy with a lack of scientifically validated research. This study reviews the limited data on reef restoration and fish assemblages, and complements this with the more extensive understanding of complex interactions between natural reefs and fishes and how this might inform restoration efforts. It also discusses which key fish species or functional groups may promote, facilitate or inhibit restoration efforts and, in turn, how restoration efforts can be optimised to enhance coral fish assemblages. By highlighting critical knowledge gaps in relation to fishes and restoration interactions, the study aims to stimulate research into the role of reef fishes in restoration projects. A greater understanding of the functional roles of reef fishes would also help inform whether restoration projects can return fish assemblages to their natural compositions or whether alternative species compositions develop, and over what timeframe. Although alleviation of local and global reef stressors remains a priority, reef restoration is an important tool; an increased understanding of the interactions between replanted corals and the fishes they support is critical for ensuring its success for people and nature.

AB  - Coral transplantation has been used in reef restoration for several decades, but information on the type of projects, their scope, scale, and success is mostly limited to published scientific studies and technical reports. Many practitioners do not have the capacity to share their progress in peer-reviewed literature, yet likely have a wealth of information to share on how to improve the efficiency of transplantation efforts. In order to incorporate non-published data on coral transplantation projects and gain an overview of the general features of these projects, we conducted an initial systematic online survey of projects run by various practitioners. Surveyed projects (n = 50) covered most of the tropical belt and ranged in size from a few hundred transplanted corals to >5000 transplants. The most frequent source of coral fragments were corals already broken from some previous impact (\"corals of opportunity\"; 58% of projects), followed by fragments stored in different types of aquaculture systems (42% of projects). The use of sexual reproduction was very limited. Fast-growing, branching corals were used in 96% of projects, being by far the most common transplanted growth form. About half of the projects mentioned undertaking maintenance of the transplantation plots. The majority of projects undertook subsequent monitoring (80%), yet the available data indicates that duration of monitoring efforts was not adequate to evaluate long-term success. The findings underline that while some general principles for successful coral restoration projects are reasonably well established, others need to be mainstreamed better in order to improve the effectiveness of coral transplantation for reef restoration. This relates in particular to sustainable funding, adequate site assessment, and long-term monitoring using established protocols. Additional information is needed to better understand and address potential challenges with regards to the sourcing of transplants and use of slow-growing species. A better integration of practitioners is necessary to improve the understanding of coral transplantation effectiveness. The results underline a need to develop and use monitoring protocols that allow gauging and comparing the effectiveness of coral transplantation among various projects, as well as for accessible platform(s) to allow the exchange of experiences made in different projects. Regular surveys of restoration projects are recommended to collate and share information among practitioners. We provide a number of recommendations for items to include in future surveys.

AB  - Coral reefs worldwide are increasingly damaged by anthropogenic stressors, necessitating novel approaches for their management. Maintaining healthy fish communities counteracts reef degradation, but degraded reefs smell and sound less attractive to settlement-stage fishes than their healthy states. Here, using a six-week field experiment, we demonstrate that playback of healthy reef sound can increase fish settlement and retention to degraded habitat. We compare fish community development on acoustically enriched coral-rubble patch reefs with acoustically unmanipulated controls. Acoustic enrichment enhances fish community development across all major trophic guilds, with a doubling in overall abundance and 50% greater species richness. If combined with active habitat restoration and effective conservation measures, rebuilding fish communities in this manner might accelerate ecosystem recovery at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Acoustic enrichment shows promise as a novel tool for the active management of degraded coral reefs.

AB  - Coral reefs in Culebra Bay (North Pacific of Costa Rica) are threatened by multiple anthropogenic disturbances including global warming, overfishing, eutrophication, and invasive species outbreaks. It is possible to assist their recovery by implementing ecological restoration techniques. This study used artificial hexagonal steel structures, called \"spiders\" to compare growth of <i>Pocillopora</i> spp. coral fragments of different sizes. Three initial fragment class sizes were used: 2, 5 and 8 cm, with each class size having 42 initial fragments. Changes in fragment length, width and area were measured monthly from January to December 2020. Results showed an overall survivorship of 70.21%, and no significant differences in survivorship and linear growth rate were detected between class sizes. The linear growth rates are 4.49 ± 1.19 cm year<sup>-1</sup>, 5.35 ± 1.48 cm year<sup>-1</sup> and 3.25 ± 2.22 cm year<sup>-1</sup> for the 2, 5 and 8 cm initial class sizes, respectively. Our results do not show significant differences in growth rates between the different initial fragment sizes. However, since small fragments (2 cm) present higher mortality during the first month, we recommend using larger fragments. In addition, coral fragments grew 48% more during the non-upwelling season, which may suggest that it might be more effective and safer to start the restoration efforts during this period.

AB  - Coral reefs function as submerged breakwaters providing wave mitigation and flood-reduction benefits for coastal communities. Although the wave-reducing capacity of reefs has been associated with wave breaking and friction, studies quantifying the relative contribution by corals are lacking. To fill this gap, a series of experiments was conducted on a trapezoidal artificial reef model with and without fragments of staghorn coral skeletons attached. The experiments were performed at the University of Miami’s Surge-Structure-Atmosphere-Interaction (SUSTAIN) Facility, a large-scale wind/wave tank, where the influence of coral skeletons on wave reduction under different wave and depth conditions was quantified through water level and wave measurements before and after the reef model. Coral skeletons reduce wave transmission and increase wave-energy dissipation, with the amount depending on the hydrodynamic conditions and relative geometrical characteristics of the reef. The trapezoidal artificial coral reef model was found to reduce up to 98% of the wave energy with the coral contribution estimated to be up to 56% of the total wave-energy dissipation. Depending on the conditions, coral skeletons can thus enhance significantly, through friction, the wave-reducing capability of a reef.

AB  - Coral reefs can provide significant coastal protection benefits to people and property. Here we show that the annual expected damages from flooding would double, and costs from frequent storms would triple without reefs. For 100-year storm events, flood damages would increase by 91% to $US 272 billion without reefs. The countries with the most to gain from reef management are Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mexico, and Cuba; annual expected flood savings exceed $400 M for each of these nations. Sea-level rise will increase flood risk, but substantial impacts could happen from reef loss alone without better near-term management. We provide a global, process-based valuation of an ecosystem service across an entire marine biome at (sub)national levels. These spatially explicit benefits inform critical risk and environmental management decisions, and the expected benefits can be directly considered by governments (e.g., national accounts, recovery plans) and businesses (e.g., insurance). Coral reefs provide significant coastal protection from storms but they have experienced significant losses. Here the authors show that the annual damages from flooding would double globally without reefs and they quantify where reefs provide the most protection to people and property.

AB  - Coral reefs are increasingly recognized for their shoreline protection services. The hydrodynamic performance of this ecosystem is comparable to artificial low-crested structures often used in coastal protection, whose objective is to emulate the former. Coral reefs also provide other important environmental services (e.g. food production, habitat provision, maintenance of biodiversity and social and cultural services) and leave almost no ecological footprint when conservation and restoration actions are conducted to maintain their coastal protection service. However, studies have focused on their flood protection service, but few have evaluated the morphological effects of coral reefs through their ability to avoid or mitigate coastal erosion. In this paper, we investigate the relation between shoreline change, reefs’ geometry and hydrodynamic parameters to elucidate the physics related to how the Mesoamerican Reef in Mexico protects sandy coastlines from erosion. Using numerical wave propagation and historical shoreline change calculated from satellite imagery, a direct correlation was found between shoreline movement, the depths and widths of reef flats, changes in the wave energy flux, and the radiation stresses of breaking waves. The findings indicate that the most remarkable efficacy in preventing beach erosion is due to reefs with shallow crests, wide reef flats, a dissipative lagoon seabed, located at ~300 m from the coastline. The results provide essential insights for reef restoration projects focused on erosion mitigation and designing artificial reefs in microtidal sandy beaches. Results are limited to wave-dominated coasts.

AB  - Coral reefs are highly endangered ecosystems. The identification and quantification of potential stress factors are essential to protect them. UV filters from sunscreens that are introduced to coral reef areas are considered as one of these stressors. Their impacts on limnic organisms have also been shown to be highly variable. It is therefore to be expected that their effects on corals also differ significantly and that each compound has to be evaluated individually. The demand for conclusive benchmarks and guidelines from policy makers and the public over the past years show the necessity for an objective literature review on the effects of various UV filters on scleractinian corals. Here, we review the present literature, summarize the data on the different UV filters and discuss the different approaches, advantages and limitations of the studies. However, the methods used in the latter studies vary greatly. They differ in many aspects such as species and life stage used, field and laboratory approaches, with exposure times ranging from hours to weeks. Some studies include analytics and measure the actual test concentration, others only provide nominal concentrations. The lack of standardized methods renders comparisons between studies futile. Additionally, most UV filters have only been investigated in a single or a few studies of different quality. Reliable thresholds are therefore impossible to draw on the basis of currently available studies. Nevertheless, certain UV filters repeatedly showed comparable toxicity in both freshwater and marine species tested. Yet, existing differences in results from coral tests emphasize the need for a standardized testing method comparable to those established for other aquatic organisms in order to allow for a more conclusive assessment. In this review, we describe what a scientifically sound testing proposal should include in order to obtain reliable and reproducible data, which ultimately should result in an internationally organized standardized ring test trial. Such standardized toxicity tests would enable validation of coral toxicity data related to UV filters, but also testing of other types of compounds that are known to be introduced and affect coral reefs, thus helping to identify significant stressors and enabling objective policy decisions.

AB  - Coral reefs are effective natural coastal flood barriers that protect adjacent communities. Coral degradation compromises the coastal protection value of reefs while also reducing their other ecosystem services, making them a target for restoration. Here we provide a physics-based evaluation of how coral restoration can reduce coastal flooding for various types of reefs. Wave-driven flooding reduction is greatest for broader, shallower restorations on the upper fore reef and between the middle of the reef flat and the shoreline than for deeper locations on the fore reef or at the reef crest. These results indicate that to increase the coastal hazard risk reduction potential of reef restoration, more physically robust species of coral need to be outplanted to shallower, more energetic locations than more fragile, faster-growing species primarily being grown in coral nurseries. The optimization and quantification of coral reef restoration efforts to reduce coastal flooding may open hazard risk reduction funding for conservation purposes.

AB  - Coral reefs are deteriorating worldwide prompting reef managers and stakeholders to increasingly explore new management tools. Following back-to-back bleaching in 2016/2017, multi-taxa coral nurseries were established in 2018 for the first time on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to aid reef maintenance and restoration at a \"high-value\" location-Opal Reef-frequented by the tourism industry. Various coral species (n = 11) were propagated within shallow water (ca. 4-7m) platforms installed across two sites characterised by differing environmental exposure-one adjacent to a deep-water channel (Blue Lagoon) and one that was relatively sheltered (RayBan). Growth rates of coral fragments placed onto nurseries were highly variable across taxa but generally higher at Blue Lagoon (2.1-10.8 cm2 month-1 over 12 months) compared to RayBan (0.6-6.6 cm2 month-1 over 9 months). Growth at Blue Lagoon was largely independent of season, except for Acropora tenuis and Acropora hyacinthus, where growth rates were 15-20% higher for December 2018-July 2019 (\"warm season\") compared to August-December 2018 (\"cool season\"). Survivorship across all 2,536 nursery fragments was ca. 80-100%, with some species exhibiting higher survivorship at Blue Lagoon (Acropora loripes, Porites cylindrica) and others at RayBan (A. hyacinthus, Montipora hispida). Parallel measurements of growth and survivorship were used to determine relative return-on-effort (RRE) scores as an integrated metric of \"success\" accounting for life history trade-offs, complementing the mutually exclusive assessment of growth or survivorship. RRE scores within sites (across species) were largely driven by growth, whereas RRE scores between sites were largely driven by survivorship. The initial nursery phase of coral propagation therefore appears useful to supplement coral material naturally available for stewardship of frequently visited Great Barrier Reef tourism (high-value) sites, but further assessment is needed to evaluate how well the growth rates and survival for nursery grown corals translate once material is outplanted.

AB  - Coral reef systems are at the point where passive restoration measures may have to be complemented by active restoration to protect global reefs. No longer is habitat conservation enough with the level and frequency of reef disturbance. This review explores the ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approach of active coral restoration, with people at the centre of analysis. This paper undertakes a perspective review that collated (n = 37) academic papers and develops a ‘Human Dimensions of Coral Restoration Technology Adaptation’ framework that helps position the wide range of human dimensions of coral restoration studies. Seven phases were considered including assessing risks, assessing cost/benefits, understanding the socio-cultural context, implementing and technology transfer, managing conflict and maintaining success and scale-up of coral restoration. With every new restoration technology, calculating the micro- and macro-risks of such interventions is critical, followed by weighing up opportunity costs of such new technologies. People in situ hold the power to shape these restoration projects including the scientists envisioning these interventions, communities at grassroots, leaders that act as gatekeepers and businesses and tourists alike. Stakeholder management as well as the enabling governance arrangements are also critical strengthening opportunities to managing any potential underlying conflict that is possible between stakeholders.

AB  - Coral reef restoration activity is accelerating worldwide in efforts to offset the rate of reef health declines. Many advances have already been made in restoration practices centred on coral biology (coral restoration), and particularly those that look to employ the high adaptive state and capacity of corals in order to ensure that efforts rebuilding coral biomass also equip reefs with enhanced resilience to future stress. We horizon scan the state-of-play for the many coral restoration innovations already underway across the complex life cycle for corals that spans both asexual and sexual reproduction - assisted evolution (manipulations targeted to the coral host and host-associated microbes), biobanking, as well as scalable coral propagation and planting - and how these innovations are in different stages of maturity to support new 21st century reef management frameworks. Realising the potential for coral restoration tools as management aids undoubtedly rests on validating different approaches as their application continues to scale. Whilst the ecosystem service responses to increased scaling still largely remain to be seen, coral restoration has already delivered immense new understanding of coral and coral-associated microbial biology that has long lagged behind advances in other reef sciences.

AB  - Coral reef ecosystems have suffered an unprecedented loss of habitat-forming hard corals in recent decades. While marine conservation has historically focused on passive habitat protection, demand for and interest in active restoration has been growing in recent decades. However, a disconnect between coral restoration practitioners, coral reef managers and scientists has resulted in a disjointed field where it is difficult to gain an overview of existing knowledge. To address this, we aimed to synthesise the available knowledge in a comprehensive global review of coral restoration methods, incorporating data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, complemented with grey literature and through a survey of coral restoration practitioners. We found that coral restoration case studies are dominated by short-term projects, with 60% of all projects reporting less than 18 months of monitoring of the restored sites. Similarly, most projects are relatively small in spatial scale, with a median size of restored area of 100 m2. A diverse range of species are represented in the dataset, with 229 different species from 72 coral genera. Overall, coral restoration projects focused primarily on fast-growing branching corals (59% of studies), and report survival between 60 and 70%. To date, the relatively young field of coral restoration has been plagued by similar ‘growing pains’ as ecological restoration in other ecosystems. These include 1) a lack of clear and achievable objectives, 2) a lack of appropriate and standardised monitoring and reporting and, 3) poorly designed projects in relation to stated objectives. Mitigating these will be crucial to successfully scale up projects, and to retain public trust in restoration as a tool for resilience based management. Finally, while it is clear that practitioners have developed effective methods to successfully grow corals at small scales, it is critical not to view restoration as a replacement for meaningful action on climate change.

AB  - Coral reef ecosystems are under increasing pressure from local and regional stressors and a changing climate. Current management focuses on reducing stressors to allow for natural recovery, but in many areas where coral reefs are damaged, natural recovery can be restricted, delayed or interrupted because of unstable, unconsolidated coral fragments, or rubble. Rubble fields are a natural component of coral reefs, but repeated or high-magnitude disturbances can prevent natural cementation and consolidation processes, so that coral recruits fail to survive. A suite of interventions have been used to target this issue globally, such as using mesh to stabilise rubble, removing the rubble to reveal hard substrate and deploying rocks or other hard substrates over the rubble to facilitate recruit survival. Small, modular structures can be used at multiple scales, with or without attached coral fragments, to create structural complexity and settlement surfaces. However, these can introduce foreign materials to the reef, and a limited understanding of natural recovery processes exists for the potential of this type of active intervention to successfully restore local coral reef structure. This review synthesises available knowledge about the ecological role of coral rubble, natural coral recolonisation and recovery rates and the potential benefits and risks associated with active interventions in this rapidly evolving field. Fundamental knowledge gaps include baseline levels of rubble, the structural complexity of reef habitats in space and time, natural rubble consolidation processes and the risks associated with each intervention method. Any restoration intervention needs to be underpinned by risk assessment, and the decision to repair rubble fields must arise from an understanding of when and where unconsolidated substrate and lack of structure impair natural reef recovery and ecological function. Monitoring is necessary to ascertain the success or failure of the intervention and impacts of potential risks, but there is a strong need to specify desired outcomes, the spatial and temporal context and indicators to be measured. With a focus on the Great Barrier Reef, we synthesise the techniques, successes and failures associated with rubble stabilisation and the use of small structures, review monitoring methods and indicators, and provide recommendations to ensure that we learn from past projects.

AB  - Continued anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are acidifying our oceans, and hydrogen ion concentrations in surface oceans are predicted to increase 150% by 2100. Ocean acidification (OA) is changing ocean carbonate chemistry, including causing rapid reductions in calcium carbonate availability with implications for many marine organisms, including biogenic reefs formed by oysters. The impacts of OA are marked. Adult oysters display both decreased growth and calcification rates, while larval oysters show stunted growth, developmental abnormalities, and increased mortality. These physiological impacts are affecting ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services by oyster reefs. Oysters are ecologically and economically important, providing a wide range of ecosystem services, such as improved water quality, coastlines protection, and food provision. OA has the potential to alter the delivery and the quality of the ecosystem services associated with oyster reefs, with significant ecological and economic losses. This review provides a summary of current knowledge of OA on oyster biology, but then links these impacts to potential changes to the provision of ecosystem services associated with healthy oyster reefs.

AB  - Construction of breakwaters provides an engineering solution for coastal protection. However, little effort has been made toward understanding the ecological impact on local coral reef ecosystems and developing engineering structures that would enhance the coral reef environment. A submerged breakwater proposed for Kahului Commercial Harbor, Hawai‘i, provided an opportunity to design a multi-purpose ‘reef structure’ to mitigate wave impacts while providing new coral reef habitat. This design involved ecological and environmental considerations alongside engineering principles, serving as a model for environmentally sound harbor development. This field study evaluated environmental conditions and reef community composition at the proposed site in a gradient extending outward from the harbor, using in situ data with multivariate analyses. Benthic and topographic features in the area were assessed using a towed drop camera system to relate to biological factors. Results that support breakwater topography should follow the natural spur and groove and depth of the adjacent reef and orient with wave direction. A deep area characterized by unconsolidated substrata and low coral cover would be replaced with the shallow, sloping hard bottom of the breakwater, and provide an exemplary area for corals to flourish while protecting the harbor from large ocean swells. Surfaces on shallow sloping hard bottoms receive higher levels of irradiance that benefits coral growth. Optimal levels of water motion facilitate sediment removal and promote coral recruitment and growth. The design of the Kahului Harbor submerged multi-purpose structure serves as a model for design of shoreline modification that enhances, rather than degrades, the local coral reef environment.

AB  - Constructed oyster reefs (CORs) provide shore protections and habitats for fish and shellfish communities via wave energy attenuation. However, the processes and mechanism of CORs on wave attenuation remain unclear, thus limiting the effective assessment of CORs for shoreline protection. This paper presents results of a field investigation on wave characteristics and wave spectral variations along a shoreline with CORs in an estuary with a large tidal range as well as large wind waves and swell energy. Six pressure transducers were deployed from January 31 to April 2, 2018, in Gandy’s Beach, New Jersey, in upper Delaware Bay. CORs were constructed at the study site in 2016 as living shoreline structures after Hurricane Sandy. The data collected from the study site exhibits the wave variations and spectral characteristics over the span of 2 months, including four winter storms (i.e., nor’easters). The spatial variations of wave heights measured on both sides of CORs show a strong dependence on the ratio between the freeboard of CORs and the offshore wave heights. Due to the large tidal range (> 2 m), the crests of CORs remain submerged over 85% of the time. The submerged CORs only provide partial attenuation of wave energy. The wave environment in the estuary is complex, especially during nor’easters. For instance, winds with rapid changing fetches could lead to bi-modal wind seas. Due to the complex wave spectra, the bulk wave heights such as the significant wave heights cannot be adopted to adequately reveal the capacity of CORs to attenuate wave energy. Spectral analysis is conducted to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of wave energy in targeted frequency bins. The spectral analysis results reveal the energy transfer from the primary waves to the high harmonics after waves propagate over the submerged CORs. Moreover, it is found that swell energy originated from the Atlantic Ocean can penetrate CORs without any dampening even when CORs are emergent. This study could help resource managers for in-depth evaluation of living shoreline effectiveness and improvement of living shoreline structures such as CORs.

AB  - Considering that the degradation of ecological systems is an urgent environmental challenge, promoting multiple ecosystem services (ES) through ecological restoration has recently become more critical. However, the complicated interactions among multiple ES are not fully considered in ecological restoration planning and management, which prevents simultaneous improvements to environmental and human welfare. In this study, the spatio-temporal variations of multiple ES and their interactions were investigated in the Pingjiang catchment, which used to suffer severe soil erosion and has been the target of the ecological restoration projects. The results showed that five individual ES were heterogeneously distributed, and each individual ES and their overall benefits have increased with the implementation of ecological restoration (except for water yield). However, significantly negative correlations existed in over half of ten ES pairs, and the trade-offs among the five individual ES also increased. Through redundancy analysis, the forest proportion (FP) was identified as the major socio-ecological factor that determines multiple ES patterns; therefore, determining the appropriate FP for restoration areas is important for regulating the supply of ES. The constraint effects of FP on each ES and their overall benefits and trade-offs were examined, and inconsistent thresholds were detected for some relationships. Thus, a comprehensive index (ES index) that incorporates the overall trade-offs was proposed to reflect the complicated interactions among multiple ES and the preferences of different stakeholder groups. The constraint effect of FP on the ES index was explored, and the threshold values detected in the hump-shaped curve of the constraint lines provided references for determining the appropriate FP. This study established an integrated land use management framework by proposing a comprehensive ES index and determining its critical thresholds through the constraint line method. The results provide insights for the better planning and targeting of ecological restoration and land use management projects worldwide.

AB  - Combining foreshore ecosystems like saltmarshes and mangroves with traditional hard engineering structures may offer a more sustainable solution to coastal protection than engineering structures alone. However, foreshore ecosystems, are rapidly degrading on a global scale due to human activities and climate change. Marsh-edges could be protected by using connected ecosystems, such as shellfish reefs and seagrass beds, which can trap and stabilize sediments, thereby reducing hydrodynamics loads on the saltmarsh edge. In our study, we aimed to test the effect of large-scale biodegradable artificial reefs on tidal flat accretion and/or stabilization. We hypothesized that the structures would attenuate waves and trap sediment. For this, a large-scale experiment was conducted on the tidal flats of the Dutch Wadden Sea, by installing biodegradable artificial reefs along 630 m. Waves, sediment dynamics and sediment properties around the structures were monitored over three years. Our results demonstrate that intact structures attenuated circa 30% of the wave height with water levels below 0.5 m. Variability in wave-attenuation increased when the wind direction was parallel to the structures/foreshore. Sediment dynamics were variable due to the exposed nature of the location and environmental heterogeneity because of the landscape-scale set-up. We observed local sediment accretion up to 11 cm, however the effect did not expand beyond 10 m from the landward edge of the structures and up to 10 cm scouring was also found. Additionally, near sediment properties were not affected by the presence of the artificial reefs. Long-term effects could not be assessed due to the degradation of the structures during the experimental period. In general, we conclude that artificial reefs have the potential to attenuate waves and trap sediment on tidal flats. However, to benefit connected foreshore ecosystems like salt marshes, an even larger implementation scale and the use of more resistant structures in exposed sites is needed to affect long-term tidal flat morphology.

AB  - Cobbles (64–256 mm) are found on beaches throughout the world, influence beach morphology, and can provide shoreline stability. Detailed, frequent, and spatially large-scale quantitative cobble observations at beaches are vital toward a better understanding of sand-cobble beach systems. This study used a truck-mounted mobile terrestrial LiDAR system and a raster-based classification approach to map cobbles automatically. Rasters of LiDAR intensity, intensity deviation, topographic roughness, and slope were utilized for cobble classification. Four machine learning techniques including maximum likelihood, decision tree, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors were tested on five raster resolutions ranging from 5–50 cm. The cobble mapping capability varied depending on pixel size, classification technique, surface cobble density, and beach setting. The best performer was a maximum likelihood classification using 20 cm raster resolution. Compared to manual mapping at 15 control sites (size ranging from a few to several hundred square meters), automated mapping errors were <12% (best fit line). This method mapped the spatial location of dense cobble regions more accurately compared to sparse and moderate density cobble areas. The method was applied to a ~40 km section of coast in southern California, and successfully generated temporal and spatial cobble distributions consistent with previous observations.

AB  - Coasts and estuaries provide an abundance of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) to humans worldwide. Models that track the supply, demand, and change in EGS within these ecosystems provide valuable insights that have applications in the context of land-use planning, decision-making, and coastal community engagement. However, developing models for use in coastal and estuarine ecosystems is challenging given the multitude and variability of potential input variables, largely due to their dynamic nature and extensive use. Models that can incorporate scenarios of environmental change to forecast changes in EGS endpoints are highly valuable to decision-makers, but only a minor proportion of available EGS models offer this utility. In this chapter, we describe the domain of models most useful to coastal decision-makers, present models at multiple scales that can predict EGS changes, and examine specific examples that epitomize this utility. We also highlight common difficulties in modeling coastal and estuarine EGS and propose suggestions for integrating EGS models into the coastal management decision-making process during times of increasing environmental change.

AB  - Coastal zones, which have high ecological value and environmental function and play a key role in human development, face intense ecological stress from human activities. This study constructed an assessment index system for coastal zones and proposed a coastal ecological stress index (CESI) model. This method was then applied to the Shandong coastal zone. The results showed an increase in ecological stress from 2001 to 2016 and implied a further growth trend. The stress caused by terrigenous pollution was the most prominent, with the ecological stress index showing significant spatial difference. Qingdao exerted the highest ecological stress on the population and economy, while Yantai showed the highest stress on the coastal index. The CESI model effectively reflects the temporal and spatial characteristics of the coastal ecological stress and provides a theoretical basis for the management of different regions.

AB  - Coastal zones are increasingly threatened by stressors from both climate change and human activities. Vulnerability assessment is central to the implementation of interventions for adapting climate change. However, synthetic vulnerability based on an integrative analysis of ecosystem service and socioeconomic characteristics in urban coastal zones with tightly coupled human-nature interactions is not fully understood. Based on the Coastal Vulnerability model of the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) tool, a holistic framework for assessing coastal vulnerability to multiple hazards (sea level rise, waves and storm surge) was developed by integrating ecological, physical and socioeconomic factors into a single spatial representation and applied to the coast of Shenzhen, China. Based on the levels of biophysical exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of coastal communities, a three-dimensional decision matrix was proposed for planning location-specific interventions. Results show that approximately 15% of the coastline were categorized as having high vulnerability. Spatial vulnerability heterogeneity was found within and across the coastal districts, with Yantian grouped into the most vulnerable district. The biophysical exposure has greater influences on the overall vulnerability than either sensitivity or adaptive capacity. This study highlights the significance of complex interactions between natural ecosystems and socioeconomic conditions in driving vulnerability and suggests that combined natural-based defenses and socioeconomic factors contribute to lower vulnerability. The results can help decision-makers prioritize coastal zones for interventions and identifying adaptive strategies that target drivers of vulnerability.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have, for many decades, fascinated ecologists and geomorphologists alike. The existence of terrestrial vegetation communities in highly saline and hydraulically extremely dynamic environments has provided an ideal opportunity to study both ecological adaptation mechanisms to physical stressors as well as the importance of vegetation to landform evolution. In recent years, however, the importance of understanding the linkages between the biological and physical factors that control coastal wetland functioning and evolution has been brought into focus within the conservation, engineering, and policy sector. This is largely the result of a rising awareness of the value of coastal wetlands resulting from the services they provide to society. Those services include their role as natural sea defenses, a role that is becoming increasingly significant in the context of ever increasing coastal population densities alongside environmental pressures (e.g. sea level rise and increasing storm frequencies) arising from climate change. This paper reviews how, over the past quarter of a century, advances in field, laboratory, and numerical modeling approaches have made particular inroads into the quantification of the sea defense role of coastal wetlands. It is becoming increasingly clear that the sea defense function itself is complex and highly context dependent. Although there is now an urgent need for improved ecologicallyinformed engineering solutions, these are unlikely to be successful without future research finding appropriate ways of scaling up hydraulically important parameters to the landscape scale and defining the physical and biological process thresholds that control the continued provisioning of the sea defense function of coastal wetlands in the face of potential extreme events and sea level rise.

AB  - Coastal vegetation such as seagrass fields, salt marshes, and mangroves, contributes to coastal defence by damping incoming waves. Yet, plant species differ in flexibility due to which they interact differently with incoming waves and damp waves to a variable degree. Current wave damping models struggle to balance accuracy against computational costs when accounting for wave-vegetation interactions. Instead, they often rely on a plant-specific calibration of the drag coefficient, which limits their application across plant species. Here we show, using novel simultaneous experimental data of wave damping, water velocities and stem motion, that wave damping by quasi-flexible cylindrical vegetation is controlled by the relative velocity between water and vegetation at the upright bottom section of a stem. For the quasi-flexible vegetation conditions considered in this manuscript ( L > 1.4 and C a 700 ), our experimental evidence justifies the application of a model based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to estimate plant motion. Building on the solution of plant motion, we simulate wave damping over flexible vegetation fields through a new work factor. Our model successfully predicts damping of regular waves by rigid and flexible artificial vegetation, and real S. Anglica, P. Maritima and E. Athericus plants in the right order of magnitude under medium and high energy wave conditions. The simulated wave damping is directly linked to vegetation and wave conditions and does not require a plant-specific calibration of the drag coefficient. It is anticipated that the model will be of wide practical use in simulating wave damping by quasi-flexible cylindrical coastal vegetation across large areas with diverse plant species and wave conditions.

AB  - Coastal vegetation is widely attributed to stabilize sediment. While most studies focused on how canopy causes flow reduction and thereby affects sediment dynamics, the role of roots and rhizomes on stabilizing the surface sediment has been less well studied. This study aims to quantify interactions between above- and belowground biomass of eelgrass (i.e., living Zostera marina plants and mimics) with surface sediment erosion (i.e., bed load and suspended load), under different hydrodynamic forcing that was created using a wave flume. Belowground biomass played an important role preventing bed-load erosion, by roughly halving the amount of sediment transported after being exposed to maximal orbital velocities of 27 cm s(-1), with and without canopy. Surprisingly, for suspended sediment transport, we found opposite effects. In the presence of eelgrass, the critical erosion threshold started at lower velocities than on bare sediment, including sand and mud treatments. Moreover, in muddy systems, such resuspension reduced the light level below the minimum requirement of Z. marina. This surprising result for sediment resuspension was ascribed to a too small eelgrass patch for reducing waves but rather showing enhanced turbulence and scouring at meadow edges. Overall, we conclude that the conservation of the existent eelgrass meadows with developed roots and rhizomes is important for the sediment stabilization and the meadow scale should be taken into account to decrease sediment resuspension.

AB  - Coastal vegetation can reduce long wave run-up on beaches and inland propagation distances and thus mitigate these hazards. This paper investigates periodic long wave run-up on coastal rigid vegetation sloping beaches via a numerical study. Rigid vegetation is approximated as rigid sticks, and the numerical model is based on an implementation of Morison's formulation [21] for rigid structures induced inertia and drag stresses in the nonlinear shallow water equations. The numerical model is solved via a finite volume method on a Cartesian cut cell mesh. The accuracy of the numerical model is validated by comparison with experimental results. The model is then applied to simulate various hypothetical cases of long periodic wave run-up on a sloping vegetated beach with different plant diameters and densities, and incident long waves with different periods. The sensitivity of long wave run-up to plant diameter, stem density and wave period is investigated by comparison of the numerical results for different vegetation characteristics and different wave periods. The numerical results show that rigid vegetation can effectively reduce long wave run-up and that wave run-up is decreased with increase of plant diameter and stem density. Moreover, the attenuation of long periodic wave run-up due to vegetation is sensitive to the variation of the incident wave period, and the attenuation of wave run-up is not increased or decreased monotonically with incident wave period.

AB  - Coastal urbanisation, energy extraction, food production, shipping and transportation have led to the global proliferation of artificial structures within the coastal and marine environments (sensu “ocean sprawl”), with subsequent loss of natural habitats and biodiversity. To mitigate and compensate impacts of ocean sprawl, the practice of eco-engineering of artificial structures has been developed over the past decade. Eco-engineering aims to create sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with the natural environment for the benefit of both. The science of eco-engineering has grown markedly, yet synthesis of research into a user-friendly and practitioner-focused format is lacking. Feedback from stakeholders has repeatedly stated that a “photo user guide” or “manual” covering the range of eco-engineering options available for artificial structures would be beneficial. However, a detailed and structured “user guide” for eco-engineering in coastal and marine environments is not yet possible; therefore we present an accessible review and catalogue of trialled eco-engineering options and a summary of guidance for a range of different structures tailored for stakeholders and end-users as the first step towards a structured manual. This work can thus serve as a potential template for future eco-engineering guides. Here we provide suggestions for potential eco-engineering designs to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services of coastal artificial structures with the following structures covered: (1) rock revetment, breakwaters and groynes composed of armour stones or concrete units; (2) vertical and sloping seawalls; (3) over-water structures (i.e., piers) and associated support structures; and (4) tidal river walls.

AB  - Coastal tidal marshes are essential ecosystems for both economic and ecological reasons. They necessitate regular monitoring as the effects of climate change begin to be manifested in changes to marsh vegetation healthiness. Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) build upon previously established remote sensing techniques to monitor a variety of vegetation health metrics, including biomass, with improved flexibility and affordability of data acquisition. The goal of this study was to establish the use of RGB-based vegetation indices for mapping and monitoring tidal marsh vegetation (i.e., Spartina alterniflora) biomass. Flights over tidal marsh study sites were conducted using a multi-spectral camera on a quadcopter sUAS near vegetation peak growth. A number of RGB indices were extracted to build a non-linear biomass model. A canopy height model was developed using sUAS-derived digital surface models and LiDAR-derived digital terrain models to assess its contribution to the biomass model. Results found that the distance-based RGB indices outperformed the regular radio-based indices in coastal marshes. The best-performing biomass models used the triangular greenness index (TGI; R2 = 0.39) and excess green index (ExG; R2 = 0.376). The estimated biomass revealed high biomass predictions at the fertilized marsh plots in the Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) project at the study site. The sUAS-extracted canopy height was not statistically significant in biomass estimation but showed similar explanatory power to other studies. Due to the lack of biomass samples in the inner estuary, the proposed biomass model in low marsh does not perform as well as the high marsh that is close to shore and accessible for biomass sampling. Further research of low marsh is required to better understand the best conditions for S. alterniflora biomass estimation using sUAS as an on-demand, personal remote sensing tool.

AB  - Coastal systems are increasingly impacted by over-enrichment of nutrients, which has cascading effects for ecosystem functioning. Oyster restoration and aquaculture are both hypothesized to mitigate excessive nitrogen (N) loads via benthic denitrification. The degree to which these management activities perform similar functions for removing N, however, has not been extensively examined in New England, a place where nutrient runoff is high and increasing oyster (Crassostrea virginica) restoration and aquaculture activity is taking place. Here, we use a novel in situ methodology to directly measure net N2 and O2 fluxes across the sediment-water interface in a shallow (~1 m) coastal pond in southern Rhode Island. We collected data seasonally during 2013 and 2014 at restored oyster reefs, oyster aquaculture, oyster cultch (shell), and bare sediment. Restored oyster reefs and aquaculture had the highest mean (± SE) denitrification rates, 581.9 (± 164.2) and 346 (± 168.6) μmol N2-N m-2 h-1, respectively, and are among the highest recorded for oyster-dominated environments. Denitrification rates at sites with oyster cultch were 60.9 (± 44.3) μmol N2-N m-2 h-1, which is substantially less than the sites with active oysters but still more than 50% higher than denitrification rates measured in bare sediment (24.4 ± 10.1 μmol N2-N m-2 h-1). The increase in denitrification rates at treatments, however, varied by season and the greatest rates for restored reefs were in the fall. Overall, the greatest aggregate denitrification rates occurred in the fall. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) followed similar patterns but with greater overall rates in the summer, and displayed a strong linear relationship with denitrification (R2 = 0.9273). Our results demonstrate that habitats associated with live oysters have higher net denitrification rates and that oyster reef restoration and oyster aquaculture may provide similar benefits to the ecosystem in terms of N removal. However, gas fluxes may also be affected where three-dimensional structure is introduced via oyster shell cultch and this appears to be seasonally-dependent. These data will be important for managers as they incorporate oysters into nutrient reduction strategies and consider system-level trade-offs in services provided by oyster reef restoration and aquaculture activities.

AB  - Coastal resilience has received significant attention for managing beach erosion issues. We introduced flexible artificial coral reef (ACR) structures to diminish coastal erosion, but planar installation effects should be considered to evaluate the feasibility of coastline maintenance. In this study, we conducted a three-dimensional large-scale experiment to investigate the characteristics of planar installation of ACR, focusing on the wave mitigation performance, wave profile deformation with delay, nearshore current movement, deposition and erosion trends, and beach profile variation. We found that the ACR diminished the wave height by ~50% and the current intensity by ~60% compared with that of a conventional submerged breakwater made of dolos units. Using the dispersion velocity of the dye in a tracer experiment, the dispersion time of the ACR was approximately 1.67-times longer than that of the dolos and the current velocity was reduced, revealing that ACR significantly reduced structural erosion. With dolos, severe erosion of >10 cm occurred behind the structure, whereas there was only slight erosion with the ACR. Moreover, in a vertical beach-profile analysis, the ACR exhibited greater shoreline accretion than that of dolos. These results indicate the potential of ACR in improving coastal resilience.

AB  - Coastal marine habitats continue to be degraded, thereby compelling large-scale restoration in many parts of the world. Whether restored habitats function similarly to natural habitats and fully recover lost ecosystem services is unclear. In estuaries, oyster reefs have been degraded by multiple anthropogenic activities including destructive fishing practices and reduced water quality, motivating restoration to maintain oyster fisheries and other ecosystem services, often at relatively high cost. We compared fish and invertebrate communities on recently restored (0–1 year post-restoration), older restored (3–4 years post-restoration), and natural oyster reefs to determine if and when restored reefs support functionally similar faunal communities. To test the influence of landscape setting on the faunal communities, the restored and natural reefs, as well as a control without reef present, were distributed among three landscapes (on the edge of salt marsh away from seagrass [salt marsh landscape], on mudflats [mudflat landscape], and near to seagrass and salt marsh [seagrass landscape]). Oyster density and biomass were greatest on restored reef habitat, as were those of non-oyster bivalve species. Total abundance of invertebrates was much greater on oyster reefs than in control plots, regardless of reef or landscape type, yet were frequently highest on older restored reefs. Meanwhile, juvenile fish densities were greatest on natural reefs, at intermediate densities on older restored reefs, and least abundant on controls. When comparing the effects of reef age and landscape setting, juvenile fish densities were greatest on younger reefs within the mudflat landscape. Collectively, these results indicate that oyster reefs harbor higher densities of resident invertebrate prey, which may explain why reef habitat is also important for juvenile fish. Laboratory and field experiments supported the notion that gag grouper (a predatory demersal fish) forage more effectively on oyster reefs than on unstructured mud bottom, whereas our experiments suggest that flounders that utilize oyster reefs likely forage on adjacent mud bottom. Because landscape setting influenced fish and invertebrate communities on restored reefs, the ecological consequences of landscape setting should be incorporated into restoration decision making and site selection to enhance the recovery of ecosystem goods and services.

AB  - Coastal managers worldwide increasingly recognize the importance of conservation and restoration of natural coastal ecosystems. This ensures coastal resilience and provision of essential ecosystem services, such as wave attenuation reducing coastal flooding and erosion. In the continuum from unvegetated tidal flats to salt marshes and mangroves, fundamental physical controls as well as biotic interactions, and feedbacks among them, determine morphology and vegetation distribution. Although these processes are well described in established literature, this information is rarely applied to understanding the role of these ecosystems as coastal defense. The focus is often on specific elements of the complex system, such as vegetation structure and cover, rather than on their complex natural dynamics. This review examines whether and how the dynamic nature of tidal flat - wetlands systems contributes to, or detracts from, their role in coastal defense. It discusses how the characteristics of the system adjust to external forcing and how these adjustments affect ecosystem services. It also considers how human interventions can take advantage of natural processes to enhance or accelerate achievement of natural coastal defense.

AB  - Coastal habitats are declining worldwide, which has impacted economically important fisheries, especially in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida. As a result, extensive intertidal oyster reef and living shoreline restoration projects have been implemented. Restoration can also theoretically benefit predator populations, but this relationship is understudied. Here, the impact of habitat restoration on juvenile predatory fish (i.e., sportfish) populations (abundance) and communities (species richness, diversity, and assemblage) was assessed prior to and following oyster reef restoration and living shoreline stabilization for up to three years, and incorporated the influence of 17 environmental predictor variables. Juvenile sportfish abundance and richness (n = 11) were variable over time but collectively higher on restored oyster reefs compared to controls, and similar between control and stabilized shorelines. Sportfish abundance was best described by a combination of biotic features of the site (e.g., reef height and benthic substrate cover), prey abundance, decreasing distance to the nearest ocean inlet and dissolved oxygen. Results suggest future restoration site selection should emphasize adequate dissolved oxygen (~6 mg/L), oyster densities above 50/m2 and reef height above 55 mm, and minimum shoreline vegetation coverage of 50% to support macrofaunal prey and subsequently attract sportfish. These findings can help natural resource managers better use habitat restoration as a tool for enhancing fish populations in the future.

AB  - Coastal flooding prevention measures, such as storm-surge barriers, are being widely adopted globally because of the accelerating rise in sea levels. However, their impacts on the morphodynamics of shallow tidal embayments remain poorly understood. Here, we combine field data and modeling results from the microtidal Venice Lagoon (Italy) to identify short- and long-term consequences of flood regulation on lagoonal landforms. Artificial reduction of water levels enhances wave-induced sediment resuspension from tidal flats, promoting in-channel deposition, at the expense of salt marsh vertical accretion. In Venice, we estimate that the first 15 closures of the recently installed mobile floodgates operated between October 2020 and January 2021 contributed to a 12% reduction in marsh deposition, simultaneously promoting a generalized channel infilling. Therefore, suitable countermeasures need to be taken to offset these processes and prevent significant losses of geomorphic diversity due to repeated floodgate closures, whose frequency will increase as sea levels rise further.

AB  - Coastal erosion, aggravated by coral reef mortality is a major issue for Small Island Developing States. Traditionally gray infrastructure, financed by public budgets has been used to combat beach loss. We examined if three Nature-based Solutions (NbS): (i) coral restoration (green) (ii) restoration + limestone (hybrid) and (iii) restoration + 3D printed concrete (hybrid) could deliver positive outcomes for coastal protection and further incentivize cost sharing for reef conservation, with private beneficiaries. We modelled the impact of restoration on wave attenuation at two reefs off Barbados and simulated up-front and maintenance costs over a 25-year period. All solutions provide additionality when compared to gray infrastructure, especially in mitigating against Sea Level Rise. Restoration was the least costly with the highest risk of failure. The hybrid solutions, were less risky than the green as they provided immediate wave attenuation, alongside complementary services such as increased attractiveness due to the presence of reef fish. Their costs were however between +80% and +450% higher than gray solutions. While this might initially deter the use of NbS, blended finance and in some cases, Payments for Ecosystem Services, could provide options for governments and private beneficiaries to share costs, with ultimately greater benefits for themselves and coral reefs.

AB  - Coastal erosion is considered a major worldwide challenge. The vulnerability assessment of coastal areas, in relation to climate change, is a key topic of worldwide increasing interest. The integration of methodologies supported by Remote Sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and in situ monitoring has allowed a viable identification of vulnerable areas to erosion. In the present study, a model was proposed to the assessment of the estuarine system of Cananeia-Iguape (Brazil), by applying the evaluation and prediction of vulnerability models for the conservation and preservation of mangroves. Approximately 1221 Km2 were classified, with 16% of the total presenting high and very high vulnerability to erosion. Other relevant aspects, were the identification and georeferencing sites that showed strong evidence of erosion and, thus, having a huge influence on the final vulnerability scores. The obtained results led to the development of a multidisciplinary approach through the application of a prediction and description model that resulted from the adaptation of the study system from a set of implemented models for coastal regions, in order to contribute to the erosion vulnerability assessment in the mangroves ecosystems (and associated localities, municipalities and communities).

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide numerous services, such as nutrient cycling, climate change amelioration, and habitat provision for commercially valuable organisms. Ecosystem functions and processes are modified by human activities locally and globally, with degradation of coastal ecosystems by development and climate change occurring at unprecedented rates. The demand for coastal defense strategies against storms and sea-level rise has increased with human population growth and development along coastlines world-wide, even while that population growth has reduced natural buffering of shorelines. Shoreline hardening, a common coastal defense strategy that includes the use of seawalls and bulkheads (vertical walls constructed of concrete, wood, vinyl, or steel), is resulting in a \"coastal squeeze\" on estuarine habitats. In contrast to hardening, living shorelines, which range from vegetation plantings to a combination of hard structures and plantings, can be deployed to restore or enhance multiple ecosystem services normally delivered by naturally vegetated shores. Although hundreds of living shoreline projects have been implemented in the United States alone, few studies have evaluated their effectiveness in sustaining or enhancing ecosystem services relative to naturally vegetated shorelines and hardened shorelines. We quantified the effectiveness of (1) sills with landward marsh (a type of living shoreline that combines marsh plantings with an offshore low-profile breakwater), (2) natural salt marsh shorelines (control marshes), and (3) unvegetated bulkheaded shores in providing habitat for fish and crustaceans (nekton). Sills supported higher abundances and species diversity of fishes than unvegetated habitat adjacent to bulkheads, and even control marshes. Sills also supported higher cover of filter-feeding bivalves (a food resource and refuge habitat for nekton) than bulkheads or control marshes. These ecosystem-service enhancements were detected on shores with sills three or more years after construction, but not before. Sills provide added structure and may provide better refuges from predation and greater opportunity to use available food resources for nekton than unvegetated bulkheaded shores or control marshes. Our study shows that unlike shoreline hardening, living shorelines can enhance some ecosystem services provided by marshes, such as provision of nursery habitat.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems have drastically declined in coverage and condition across the globe. To combat these losses, marine conservation has recently employed habitat restoration as a strategy to enhance depleted coastal ecosystems. For restoration to be a successful enterprise, however, it is necessary to identify and address potential knowledge gaps and review whether the field has tracked scientific advances regarding best practices. This enables managers, researchers, and practitioners alike to more readily establish restoration priorities and goals. We synthesized the peer-reviewed, published literature on habitat restoration research in salt marshes, oyster reefs, and seagrasses to address three questions related to restoration efforts: (i) How frequent is cross-sector authorship in coastal restoration research? (ii) What is the geographic distribution of coastal restoration research? and (iii) Are abiotic and biotic factors equally emphasized in the literature, and how does this vary with time? Our vote-count survey indicated that one-third of the journal-published studies listed authors from at least two sectors, and 6% listed authors from all three sectors. Across all habitat types, there was a dearth of studies from Africa, Asia, and South America. Finally, despite many experimental studies demonstrating that species interactions can greatly affect the recovery and persistence of coastal foundation species, only one-fourth of the studies we examined discussed their effects on restoration. Combined, our results reveal gaps and discrepancies in restoration research that should be addressed in order to further propel coastal restoration science.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are increasingly recognized as essential elements within coastal defence schemes and coastal adaptation. The capacity of coastal ecosystems, like marshes and oyster reefs, to maintain their own habitat and grow with sea-level rise via biophysical feedbacks is seen as an important advantage of such systems compared to man-made hard engineering structures. Providing a suitable substrate for oysters to settle on offers a kick-start for establishment at places where they were lost or are desirable for coastal protection. Accumulation of shell material, through recruitment and growth, is essential to the maintenance of oyster reefs as it provides substrate for new generations (positive feedback loop), forming a self-sustainable structure. Insight in establishment, survival and growth thresholds and knowledge about the population dynamics are necessary to successfully implement oyster reefs in coastal defence schemes. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether artificial Pacific oyster reefs develop into self-sustaining oyster reefs that contribute to coastal protection. Reef development was investigated by studying recruitment, survival and growth rates of oysters on artificial oyster reefs in comparison with nearby natural Pacific oyster reefs. The artificial reef structure successfully offered substrate for settlement of oysters and therefore stimulated reef formation. Reef development, however, was hampered by local sedimentation and increasing tidal emersion. Tidal emersion is an important factor that can be used to predict where artificial oyster reefs have the potential to develop into self-sustaining reefs that could contribute to coastal protection, but it is also a limiting factor in using oyster reefs for coastal protection.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are constantly buffeted by anthropogenic forces that degrade habitats and alter ecological processes and functions; in turn, this habitat degradation diminishes the ecosystem goods and services on which humans rely. Within the last few decades, the field of restoration ecology has burgeoned into a discipline that marries scientific rigor with functional restoration practice—an idea championed by Pete Peterson and his research. Here, we describe our efforts to restore the hard-bottom sponge communities of Florida Bay, FL (USA)—a once-diverse subtropical lagoon severely degraded by cyanobacteria blooms—and the scientific and practical lessons learned from those efforts. Sponge community restoration yielded insights into basic sponge biology and ecology (e.g., density-dependent growth rates) and hastened the recovery of ecological processes (e.g., rates of sedimentation, structuring of water column characteristics, soundscape productions). Because the results of our initial restoration efforts were promising, our collaboration among academic researchers, natural resource managers, and non-governmental organizations has begun scaling up restoration efforts to re-establish the sponge communities over large areas of degraded hard-bottom to “jump start” the ecological recovery of Florida Bay. Though our efforts show promise for ecological recovery, restoration will require a concerted effort by scientists, resource managers, and citizens to stem the anthropogenic drivers of ecological degradation of this unique South Florida ecosystem.

AB  - Coastal developments worldwide have put entire shoreline ecosystems at risk. Recently, land reclamation has been extended to the construction of whole new islands; a phenomenon that is particularly common in Asia and the Middle East and is recognised as a global conservation issue. Using Penang Island, Malaysia as a case study, we illustrate the relationship between rapid population growth and the simultaneous increase in urbanisation, land reclamation and extent of artificial shorelines; and decrease in the quality and extent of natural coastal habitats. Our goal was to provide an up-to-date assessment of the state of coastal habitats around Penang, identify knowledge gaps and identify locations that may be potentially suitable for eco-engineering. Comparisons of historical and current topographic maps revealed that land formerly consisting of coastal swamp and forest, mangrove forests, sandy beaches, and rubber and oil plantations have been lost to large-scale land reclamation and urbanisation. Between 1960 and 2015, there were increases in urbanised area, reclaimed land, and artificial shoreline extent. The total extent of mangrove forests has remained relatively stable but this balance is characterised by significant losses on the east coast coupled with increases on the west coast. Coastal development on the island is still on-going with plans for the construction of five artificial islands and another two coastal reclamation projects are either underway or scheduled for the near future. If the plans for future land reclamations are fully realized, 32.3 km2 of the 321.8 km2 island (10%) will be reclaimed land and the associated negative effects on the island’s natural coastal habitats will be inevitable. This study highlights sections of the coast of Penang Island in need of effective monitoring, conservation and management and explores the possibility of incorporating ecological engineering into development projects, either prospectively or retrospectively, to create more environmentally-friendly urban environments and to promote educational, amenity and economic activities. With coastal development taking place on a global scale, opportunities to balance development needs with conservation strategies abound and should be integrated into present and subsequent projects to protect these coastal ecosystems for future generations.

AB  - Coastal development and climate change are dramatically increasing the risks of flooding, erosion, and extreme weather events. Coral reefs and other coastal ecosystems act as natural defenses against coastal hazards, but their degradation increases risk to people and property. Environmental degradation, however, has rarely been quantified as a driver of coastal risk. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, a region on the Mexican Caribbean coast with an annual tourism economy of 10 billion USD, coral reefs constitute a natural barrier against flooding from hurricanes. This study spatially quantifies the risk reduction benefits of the Mesoamerican Reef in Quintana Roo for people, buildings, and hotel infrastructure. The risk reduction benefits are substantial. For example, the reefs prevented 43% additional damage during Hurricane Dean (2007) and provide nowadays hazard risk reduction for 4.3% of the people, 1.9% of the built capital, and 2.4% of the hotel infrastructure, per year. The annual benefits are estimated in 4,600 people, 42 million USD damage prevention for buildings, and 20.8 million USD for hotel infrastructure. The study also compares the risk reduction of coral reefs with (i) the protection offered by dunes and (ii) the increase in coastal risk from sea-level rise. The risk reduction of dunes is more critical where there are no coral reefs offshore and for small return-periods storms. Sea-level rise, however, will make the more frequent storms more impactful and will drive significant increases in annual expected damages across the region. However, we demonstrate that, in coral reef environments, the contribution of reef degradation to coastal risk is larger than the expected increase in risk from sea level rise. However, the spatial distribution of the risk reduction benefits from reefs differs for people and infrastructure, and in particular for hotels, which receive the most protection from reefs. Furthermore, many sections present larger benefits than the typical costs of restoration. This valuation makes a compelling case for protecting and maintaining this natural infrastructure for its risk reduction service, but also allows the development of piloting innovative strategies, such as risk finance and insurance strategies, that can align environmental and risk management goals.

AB  - Coastal communities exist on the front lines of diverse natural hazards and the growing impacts of climate change. While traditional strategies for dealing with coastal hazards have often involved the hardening or armoring of shorelines, more recent research and practice have demonstrated the value and cost-effectiveness of “living shorelines” and other ecosystem-based strategies for coastal protection. To explore potential relationships among geographic exposure (waterfront vs. inland), shoreline condition (armored vs. natural), and hazard concerns, we surveyed 583 waterfront and inland residents in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We found that overall concern for coastal hazards was similar across waterfront and inland residents, as well as among residents with both armored and natural shorelines. However, concern for specific hazards differed across these groups. Waterfront residents were significantly more concerned about major hurricanes and erosion than inland residents. Conversely, inland residents were more concerned with drought and flooding than waterfront residents. Among waterfront residents, specific hazard concerns were similar between residents with natural and armored shorelines with two key exceptions. Residents with armored shorelines reported higher concern for erosion and sea level rise than residents with natural shorelines. Our results suggest that armored shorelines do not necessarily alleviate concerns about coastal hazards. In the context of balancing social and ecological objectives in addressing coastal hazards or adapting to climate change, understanding the perceptions and behaviors of coastal residents is essential for conserving and protecting coastal ecosystems along residential shorelines.

AB  - Coastal communities are increasingly vulnerable to changes in climate and weather, as well as sea-level rise and coastal erosion. The impact of these hazards can be very costly, and not just in terms of property damage, but also in lost revenue as many coastal communities are also tourism-based economies. The goal of this study is to investigate the awareness and attitudes of full-time residents and second-home property owners regarding the impact of climate and weather on property ownership and to identify the factors that most influences these attitudes in three coastal counties (Brunswick, Currituck, and Pender) of North Carolina, USA. The majority of previous studies have focused on only full-time residents’ risk perceptions. Given the fact that these coastal communities have a high percentages of second homes, this study fills that research gap by including second-home owners. This study integrates both social (survey data) and physical (geospatial coastal hazards data) aspects of vulnerability into a single assessment to understand the determinants of property owners’ risk perceptions and compare their perceived risks with their physical vulnerability. The study also compared the utility of a global ordinary least square (OLS) model with a local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to identify explanatory variables in the dataset. The GWR was found to be a slightly better fit for the data with an R2 of 0.248 (compared to 0.206 for the OLS). However, this was still relatively low and indicated that this study likely did not capture all of the factors that influence the perceptions of vulnerability in patterns of property ownership (whether full-time residents or second-home owners). The geospatial variables used to determine coastal vulnerability were found not to significantly impact perceptions related property ownership, but did provide additional insight in explaining spatial patterns of the response variable within each county.

AB  - Coastal blue carbon refers to the carbon taken from atmospheric CO2; fixed by advanced plants (including salt marsh, mangrove, and seagrass), phytoplankton, macroalgae, and marine calcifiers via the interaction of plants and microbes; and stored in nearshore sediments and soils; as well as the carbon transported from the coast to the ocean and ocean floor. The carbon sequestration capacity per unit area of coastal blue carbon is far greater than that of the terrestrial carbon pool. The mechanisms and controls of the carbon sink from salt marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, the aquaculture of shellfish and macroalgae, and the microbial carbon pump need to be further studied. The methods to quantify coastal blue carbon include carbon flux measurements, carbon pool measurements, manipulative experiments, and modeling. Restoring, conserving, and enhancing blue carbon will increase carbon sinks and produce carbon credits, which could be traded on the carbon market. The need to tackle climate change and implement China’s commitment to cut carbon emissions requires us to improve studies on coastal blue carbon science and policy. The knowledge learned from coastal blue carbon improves the conservation and restoration of salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses; enhances the function of the microbial carbon pump; and promotes sustainable aquaculture, such as ocean ranching.

AB  - Coastal armouring and the reclamation of intertidal areas through the use of seawalls and other artificial structures has been practiced for thousands of years, but its recent expansion in China and elsewhere in Asia has been unprecedented in its rate and intensity. One result has been the recent loss of nearly two-thirds of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea, a globally unique ecosystem of high ecological value. The severe effects on biodiversity of the recent large-scale coastal land claim activities in China are well documented, yet some recent studies have emphasized the ecological opportunities provided by such artificial coastal infrastructure in China, in some cases suggesting that the ecological impacts of coastal infrastructure should be reconsidered due to benefits to some rocky shore species in a changing climate. This is cause for concern because, while studying the “new ecology” arising from coastal modification is useful, broad conclusions around the ecological role or conservation gains from seawall construction without adequate contextualization underplays the ecological consequences of large-scale coastal land claim, and could potentially undermine efforts to achieve biodiversity conservation. Here, we clarify the characteristics of seawall construction in China and summarize the environmental damage and some broadscale impacts caused by this type of infrastructure expansion on the endangered Yellow Sea tidal flats ecosystem. We also highlight the urgent need for all coastal development plans to consider how coastal wetlands and ecosystem functionality can be maximally retained within the development precinct.

AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems characterized by foundation species, such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and mangrove swamps, are rich in biodiversity and support a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, food provisioning, water filtration, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, cultural value, among others. These ecosystems have experienced degradation and a net loss of total area in regions around the world due to a host of anthropogenic stressors, resulting in declines in the associated ecosystem services they provide. Because of the extensive degradation in many locations, increasing attention has turned to ecosystem restoration of these marine habitats. Restoration techniques for marine and coastal ecosystems are generally more expensive when compared to terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting locations that will provide the largest return on investment, not only for the probability and magnitude of restoration success, but also for ecosystem service outcomes. However, site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration receive relatively little attention in the scientific literature, suggesting a need to better articulate how spatial planning tools could be incorporated into restoration practice. To the degree that site selection has been formally evaluated, the criteria have tended to focus more on environmental conditions beneficial for the restored habitat, and less on ecosystem service outcomes once the habitat is restored, which may vary considerably from site to site, or with more complex landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of connectivity. Here we 1) review the recent scientific literature for several marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove swamps) to investigate the degree to which site selection or spatial planning principles are applied for marine ecosystem restoration at different spatial scales, 2) provide a conceptual overview of the rationale for applying spatial planning principles to marine ecosystem restoration, and 3) highlight promising analytical approaches from the marine spatial planning and conservation planning literatures that could help improve restoration outcomes. We argue that strategic site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration, particularly applied at larger spatial scales and accounting for ecosystem service outcomes, can help support more effective restoration.

AB  - Climate change with human direct pressures represent significant threats to the resilience of shoreline habitats like mangroves. A rapid, whole-of-system assessment strategy is needed to evaluate such threats, better linking innovative remote sensing with essential on-ground evaluations. Using the Shoreline Video Assessment Method, we surveyed around 190km of the mostly mangrove-fringed (78%) coastline of Kien Giang Province, Vietnam. The aim was to identify anthropogenic drivers of degradation, establishing baseline for specific rehabilitation and protection strategies. Fish traps occupy at least 87% of shoreline mangroves, around which there were abundant human activities - like fishing, crabbing, farming, plus collecting firewood and foliage. Such livelihoods were associated with remnant, fringing mangrove that were largely degraded and threatened by erosion retreat, herbivory, and excessive cutting. Our assessment quantified associated threats to shoreline stability, along with previous rehabilitation intervention measures. The method offers key opportunities for effective conservation and management of vulnerable shoreline habitats.

AB  - Climate change will alter natural areas on a global scale within the next century. In areas vulnerable to climate change, scientists are regularly challenged to justify the resources needed for research and conservation. We face what may seem like a losing battle, especially in low-lying coastal areas where sea-level rise is predicted to severely degrade or destroy many ecosystems. Using sea-level rise in the low-elevation state of Florida, USA, as a case study, we argue that it is critical to remain engaged in the research, restoration, and conservation of natural areas threatened by climate change for as long as possible. These areas will continue to provide invaluable ecological and societal benefits. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding climate change forecasts and their ecological impact leaves room for optimism, research, and actions that are necessary for developing adaptation plans and mitigating further sea-level rise and other consequences of climate change. We urge scientists and particularly students beginning their careers not to forego research and conservation efforts of these imperiled lands but to face this unprecedented challenge with determination, creativity, and solution-based strategies.

AB  - Climate change is increasing the threat of erosion and flooding along coastlines globally. Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures. Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to artificial structures. This research needs to happen now as our rapidly changing climate requires new and innovative solutions to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to an increasingly uncertain future.

AB  - Climate change is impacting the function and distribution of habitats used by marine, coastal, and diadromous species. These impacts often exacerbate the anthropogenic stressors that habitats face, particularly in the coastal environment. We conducted a climate vulnerability assessment of 52 marine, estuarine, and riverine habitats in the Northeast U.S. to develop an ecosystem-scale understanding of the impact of climate change on these habitats. The trait-based assessment considers the overall vulnerability of a habitat to climate change to be a function of two main components, sensitivity and exposure, and relies on a process of expert elicitation. The climate vulnerability ranks ranged from low to very high, with living habitats identified as the most vulnerable. Over half of the habitats examined in this study are expected to be impacted negatively by climate change, while four habitats are expected to have positive effects. Coastal habitats were also identified as highly vulnerable, in part due to the influence of non-climate anthropogenic stressors. The results of this assessment provide regional managers and scientists with a tool to inform habitat conservation, restoration, and research priorities, fisheries and protected species management, and coastal and ocean planning.

AB  - Climate change is a pervasive and growing global threat to biodiversity and ecosystems. Here, we present the most up-to-date assessment of climate change impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem services in the U.S. and implications for natural resource management. We draw from the 4th National Climate Assessment to summarize observed and projected changes to ecosystems and biodiversity, explore linkages to important ecosystem services, and discuss associated challenges and opportunities for natural resource management. We find that species are responding to climate change through changes in morphology and behavior, phenology, and geographic range shifts, and these changes are mediated by plastic and evolutionary responses. Responses by species and populations, combined with direct effects of climate change on ecosystems (including more extreme events), are resulting in widespread changes in productivity, species interactions, vulnerability to biological invasions, and other emergent properties. Collectively, these impacts alter the benefits and services that natural ecosystems can provide to society. Although not all impacts are negative, even positive changes can require costly societal adjustments. Natural resource managers need proactive, flexible adaptation strategies that consider historical and future outlooks to minimize costs over the long term. Many organizations are beginning to explore these approaches, but implementation is not yet prevalent or systematic across the nation.

AB  - Climate change and subsequent processes triggered by climate change demand novel assessments and protection schemes in coastal environments, as frequency and intensity of extreme events as well as mean sea water levels are expected to rise. Most often, conventional coastal engineering approaches are solely built for protection purposes, but often come with negative side-effects to the coastal environment and communities. During the last decade, new concepts in coastal engineering have started emerging. Several technical measures with an ecosystem-based design have been developed and, in some places, already implemented over the last decade. These low-regret measures, for instance green belts, coir fibers and porous submerged structures, reveal their full potential as stand-alone coastal protection or when used in combination with each other. They are believed – and in some cases documented – to be a better alternative or potential complement to conventional “hard” coastal engineering protection. Concrete examples are taken from the densely populated coastal area of Jakarta Utara (North Jakarta) and the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD), showing benefits and further opportunities, but also challenges for applied low-regret coastal protection measures and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction. An assessment of the application potential of three “soft” protection measures is given and discussed.

AB  - Climate change and population growth are degrading coastal ecosystems and increasing risks to communities and infrastructure. Reliance on seawalls and other types of hardened shorelines is unsustainable in an era of rising seas, given the costs to build and maintain these structures and their unintended consequences on ecosystems. This is especially true for communities that depend on coastal and marine ecosystems for livelihoods and sustenance. Protecting and restoring coral reefs and coastal forests can be lower cost, sustainable alternatives for shoreline protection. However, decision-makers often lack basic information about where and under what conditions ecosystems reduce risk to coastal hazards and who would benefit. To better understand where to prioritize ecosystems for coastal protection, we assessed risk reduction provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass along the entire coast of The Bahamas, under current and future climate scenarios. Modeled results show that the population most exposed to coastal hazards would more than double with future sea-level rise and more than triple if ecosystems were lost or degraded. We also found that ecosystem-based risk reduction differs across islands due to variation in a suite of ecological, physical, and social variables. On some populated islands, like Grand Bahama and Abaco, habitats provide protection to disproportionately large numbers of people compared to the rest of the country. Risk reduction provided by ecosystems is also evident for several sparsely populated, remote coastal communities, in some cases with large elderly populations. The results from our analyses were critical for engaging policy-makers in discussions about employing natural and nature-based features for coastal resilience. After hurricanes Joaquin and Matthew hit The Bahamas in 2016 and 2017, our assessment of coastal risk reduction and the multiple benefits provided by coastal ecosystems helped pave the way for an innovative loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to the Government of The Bahamas to invest in mangrove restoration for coastal resilience. This work serves as an example for other regions and investors aiming to use assessments of ecosystem services to inform financing of natural and nature-based approaches for coastal resilience and climate adaptation.

AB  - Characterizing the fragility, resistance, and resilience of marshes is critical for understanding their role in reducing storm damages and for helping to manage the recovery of these natural defenses. This study uses high-resolution aerial imagery to quantify the impacts of Hurricane Michael, a category 5 hurricane, on coastal salt marshes in the Florida Panhandle, USA. Marsh damage was classified into several categories, including deposition of sediment or wrack, fallen trees, vegetation loss, and conversion to open water. The marshes were highly resistant to storm damages even under extreme conditions; only 2% of the 173,259 km2 of marshes in the study area were damaged-a failure rate much lower than that of artificial defenses. Marshes may be more resistant than resilient to storm impacts; damaged marshes were slow to recover, and only 16% of damaged marshes had recovered 6 months after landfall. Marsh management mattered for resistance and resilience; marshes on publicly-managed lands were less likely to be damaged and more likely to recover quickly from storm impacts than marshes on private land, emphasizing the need to incentivize marsh management on private lands. These results directly inform policy and practice for hazard mitigation, disaster recovery, adaptation, and conservation, particularly given the potential for more intense hurricane landfalls as the climate changes.

AB  - Characterizing density patterns of fish and crustaceans across estuarine habitat types can provide useful information regarding their relative value. The oyster reef complex within Sabine Lake Estuary is the largest known in the United States with no record of commercial harvest, and it presents a unique opportunity to understand the habitat value of an unfished reef system in comparison with adjacent estuarine habitats. High abundances of relatively large oysters with complex formations were observed throughout the 2-y study period. Average densities of fish and crustaceans were 6 times greater at the marsh edge than the nonvegetated shallow habitats, and 40 times greater than both the oyster reef and nonvegetated deep habitats. Low faunal densities observed in the oyster reef habitat may be the result of spatial configuration and connectivity to surrounding habitats, collection limitation resulting from its large vertical relief (>1 m) and complex 3-dimensional structure, or habitat selection resulting from water depth. Because the majority of crustaceans and resident and transient fish were observed within the marsh edge and nonvegetated shallow habitats, it is difficult to determine whether oyster reefs within Sabine Lake Estuary provide essential habitats for these species. Although low densities of organisms were observed in the oyster reef habitat, multivariate analysis indicates that the unfished reef supports a unique community of fish and crustaceans. Results provide a valuable baseline for future conservation, restoration, and management actions as we seek to understand more completely and to protect important estuarine habitat types.

AB  - Change is inherent in coastal systems, which are amongst the most dynamic ones on Earth. Increasing anthropogenic pressure on coastal zones interferes with natural coastal dynamics and can cause ecosystem imbalances that render the zones less stable. Furthermore, human occupation of coastal zones often requires an uncharacteristic degree of stability for these inherently dynamic coastal systems. Coastal management teams face multifaceted challenges in protecting, rehabilitating and conserving coastal systems. Diverse monitoring schemes and modelling tools have been developed to address these challenges. In this article, we explore various perspectives: the integration of biophysical, ecological and social components; the uncertainties of diverse data sources; and the development of flexible coastal interventions. We propose general criteria and guidance for an Ecosystem-based Management (EbM) to coastal management, which aims primarily at adaptation to global change and uncertainties, and to managing and integrating social aspects and biophysical components based on the flows of energy and matter.

AB  - Caribbean coral reefs are in decline and the deployment of artificial reefs, structures on the sea bottom that mimic one or more characteristics of a natural reef, is increasingly often considered to sustain ecosystem services. Independent of their specific purposes, it is essential that artificial reefs do not negatively affect the already stressed surrounding habitat. To evaluate the ecological effects of artificial reefs in the Caribbean, an analysis was performed on 212 artificial reefs that were deployed in the Greater Caribbean between 1960 and 2018, based on cases documented in grey (n = 158) and scientific (n = 54) literature. Depending on the availability of data, reef type and purpose were linked to ecological effects and fisheries management practices around the artificial reefs. The three most common purposes to deploy artificial reefs were to create new dive sites (41%), to perform research (22%) and to support ecosystem restoration (18%), mainly by stimulating diversity. Ship wrecks (44%), reef balls© (13%) and piles of concrete construction blocks (11%) were the most-often deployed artificial reef structures and metal and concrete were the most-used materials. The ecological development on artificial reefs in the Caribbean appeared to be severely understudied. Research and monitoring has mostly been done on small experimental reefs that had been specifically designed for science, whereas the most commonly deployed artificial reef types have hardly been evaluated. Studies that systematically compare the ecological functioning of different artificial reef types are virtually non-existent in the Caribbean and should be a research priority, including the efficacy of new designs and materials. Comparisons with natural reef ecosystems are scarce. Artificial reefs can harbor high fish densities and species richness, but both fish and benthos assemblages often remain distinct from natural ecosystems. Studies from other parts of the world show that artificial reefs can influence the surrounding ecosystem by introducing non-indigenous species and by leaking iron. As artificial reefs attract part of their marine organisms from surrounding habitats, intensive exploitation by fishers, without clear management, can adversely affect the fish stocks in the surrounding area and thus counteract any potential ecosystem benefits. This study shows that over 80% of artificial reefs in the Caribbean remain accessible to fishers and are a risk to the surrounding habitat. To ensure artificial reefs and their fisheries do not negatively affect the surrounding ecosystem, it is imperative to include artificial reefs, their fisheries and the surrounding ecosystem in monitoring programs and management plans and to create no-take zones around artificial reefs that are not monitored.

AB  - Carbonate budgets dynamically balance production and loss of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on coral reefs. To sustain or expand the coral reef framework, CaCO3 production by calcifying organisms must be higher than erosion. However, global climate change has been negatively impacting carbonate production, with bleaching events causing widespread coral mortality. While bleaching and coral mortality are well documented, the fate of coral colonies after their death, including their erosion rates, are still poorly known. We followed the fate of 143 recently dead individual coral colonies with complex growth forms (arborescent, caespitose, corymbose, digitate, and tabular), whose mortality was triggered by two consecutive bleaching events. These colonies, spread over 16 km2 of the Lizard Island reef complex, were tracked for up to 5 years, allowing detailed examination of erosion rates and post-mortality structural persistence. We also tested how variables that are commonly used in coral reef erosion studies relate to spatial and temporal variability in the erosion rates of dead coral colonies. We revealed rapid erosion of dead coral colonies, with an average of 79.7% of dead colonies completely disintegrating within 60 months. The predicted half-life of a dead coral colony was 40 months, with limited variation among wave exposure levels. Remarkably, we found no effect of estimated parrotfish bioerosion, wave exposure, nor coral growth form, on observed erosion rates. Our results suggest that our understanding of the erosion of dead corals may be more limited than previously thought. The rapid loss of coral colonies on our study sites calls for a re-evaluation of the role of corals with complex growth forms in reef growth and of parrotfishes in reef erosion.

AB  - Carbon burial is increasingly valued as a service provided by threatened vegetated coastal habitats. Similarly, shellfish reefs contain significant pools of carbon and are globally endangered, yet considerable uncertainty remains regarding shellfish reefs' role as sources (+) or sinks (-) of atmospheric CO2 While CO2 release is a by-product of carbonate shell production (then burial), shellfish also facilitate atmospheric-CO2 drawdown via filtration and rapid biodeposition of carbon-fixing primary producers. We provide a framework to account for the dual burial of inorganic and organic carbon, and demonstrate that decade-old experimental reefs on intertidal sandflats were net sources of CO2 (7.1 ± 1.2 MgC ha-1 yr-1 (µ ± s.e.)) resulting from predominantly carbonate deposition, whereas shallow subtidal reefs (-1.0 ± 0.4 MgC ha-1 yr-1) and saltmarsh-fringing reefs (-1.3 ± 0.4 MgC ha-1 yr-1) were dominated by organic-carbon-rich sediments and functioned as net carbon sinks (on par with vegetated coastal habitats). These landscape-level differences reflect gradients in shellfish growth, survivorship and shell bioerosion. Notably, down-core carbon concentrations in 100- to 4000-year-old reefs mirrored experimental-reef data, suggesting our results are relevant over centennial to millennial scales, although we note that these natural reefs appeared to function as slight carbon sources (0.5 ± 0.3 MgC ha-1 yr-1). Globally, the historical mining of the top metre of shellfish reefs may have reintroduced more than 400 000 000 Mg of organic carbon into estuaries. Importantly, reef formation and destruction do not have reciprocal, counterbalancing impacts on atmospheric CO2 since excavated organic material may be remineralized while shell may experience continued preservation through reburial. Thus, protection of existing reefs could be considered as one component of climate mitigation programmes focused on the coastal zone.

AB  - Calvo et al. (2020) criticize a new seagrass rehabilitation method proposed by Alagna et al. (2019) and inspired by the Posidonia oceanica spontaneous recovery observed at Capo Feto (Sicily), were recolonization was detected almost exclusively on rubbles deployed to fill a pipeline trench. Calvo et al. (2020) claim that natural recovery occurred consistently also on dead matte along the eastern side of the trench, weakening the assumption on which the method is based. Here we show that the P. oceanica patches reported by these authors as new establishments were already documented in 2003 (Vega Fernandez et al., 2005) and are attributable to the fragmentation of the pristine meadow caused by altered sedimentation rate after an extensive dredging operation. Moreover, we outline the area of applicability of the method tested in Alagna et al. (2019) and provide a point-by-point rebuttal to the complaints of imprecise and misleading contents of the paper.

AB  - California cities face growing threats from sea-level rise as increased frequency and severity of flooding and storms cause devastating erosion, infrastructure damage, and loss of property. Management plans are often designed to prevent or slow flooding with short-term, defensive strategies such as shoreline hardening, beach nourishment, and living shorelines. By contrast, managed retreat focuses on avoiding hazards and adapting to changing shorelines by relocating out of harm’s way. However, the term “managed retreat” can be controversial and has engendered heated debates, defensive protests, and steady resistance in some communities. Such responses have stymied inclusion of managed retreat in adaptation plans, and in some cases has resulted in complete abandonment of the policy review process. We examined the Local Coastal Program review process in seven California communities at imminent risk of sea-level rise and categorized each case as receptive or resistant to managed retreat. Three prominent themes distinguished the two groups: (1) inclusivity, timing, and consistency of communication, (2) property ownership, and (3) stakeholder reluctance to change. We examined use of terminology and communication strategies and provided recommendations to communicate “managed retreat” more effectively.

AB  - By the later part of the 21st Century, our planet will be faced with compelling climatic circumstances requiring tradeoffs to maintain viable environmental conditions and standards of living. The prognosis for people near coastlines and waterways is particularly dire without decisive actions that capitalize on shared strengths such as ecosystems. One clear opportunity is the regenerative services and co-benefits of natural infrastructure that reduce the impacts of environmental disasters as magnified by climatic change. Certainly, nature-based solutions are increasingly being viewed as critical actions to reduce societal risk. However, to advance the use of natural infrastructure through eco-engineering, there is a need to clarify the science regarding risk reduction effectiveness, develop agreeable principles, standards, and designs, and grow a demonstration site network responsive to circumstances faced by communities around the globe. In addition, there is a need to consider the legal, policy, and regulatory obstacles and opportunities for natural infrastructure within local to national contexts (i.e., science-based building codes, architectural design criteria, incentive policies, etc.). Ultimately, the integration of science, designs, and policy coupled with installation within several global resource management processes (IWRM, ICZM, etc.) will help establish eco-engineering standards. Supportive coastal, river, and urban examples from around the world are used to illustrate the current state of knowledge, model this integration of science, design, and policy, serve as initial “benchmark site”, and finally help define guiding principles for the emerging field of eco-engineering.

AB  - By filtering large volumes of water and releasing nutrient-rich biodeposits (feces and pseudofeces), oysters can locally enhance sediment biogeochemical cycling. An active Crassostrea virginica restoration program in Mosquito Lagoon, FL (USA), was leveraged to assess the immediate (first-year) effects of restoration on sediment nutrients. Measurements included extractable and total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus on dead, natural, and restored reefs using a before-after-control-impact design. To investigate an observed “age-nutrient paradox” in sediment nutrient concentrations, a laboratory experiment compared feeding rates and biodeposit nutrient content between juvenile and older oysters. The field study documented a 136% increase in ammonium, 78% increase in total nitrogen, 46% increase in total phosphorus, and 75% increase in organic matter concentrations 12 months post-restoration, with extractable nutrients responding more rapidly to restoration than total nutrients. Sediment nutrient increases were positively correlated with oyster density, shell length, and reef height. Moreover, the laboratory study indicated juvenile oysters had higher rates of chlorophyll-a removal and ammonium efflux and produced biodeposits with higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, nitrate, and ammonium than older oysters. Overall, this study documented increases in sediment nutrients on intertidal reefs within the first year of restoration, which may be explained by a greater filtration rate and more nutrient-enriched biodeposits contributed by young oysters as compared to older oysters. Sediment total nitrogen and ammonium content may be the most robust monitoring metrics for documenting the ecosystem service of enhanced biogeochemical cycling on restored oyster reefs.

AB  - By combatting erosion and increasing habitat, mangrove living shorelines are an effective alternative to hard-armoring in tropical and subtropical areas. An experimental red mangrove living shoreline was deployed within Mosquito Lagoon, Florida, using a factorial design to test the impact of mangrove age, breakwater presence, and mangrove placement on mangrove survival within the first year of deployment. Mixed mangrove age treatments were included to identify if seedling (11-month-old) survival could be enhanced by the presence of transitional (23-month-old) and adult (35 to 47-month-old) mangroves. Environmental factors were monitored to detect possible causes of mangrove mortalities. Approximately half (50.6%) of mangroves died, and of those, 90.7% occurred within the annual high-water season, and 88.9% showed signs of flooding stress. Planting seedlings haphazardly among older mangroves did not attenuate enough wave energy to significantly increase seedling survival. Breakwaters alleviated stress through a reduction in water velocity and wave height, increasing the odds of survival by 197% and 437% when mangroves were planted in the landward and seaward rows, respectively. Compared to seedlings, deployment of adult mangroves increased survival odds by 1087%. Collectively, our results indicate that sites with a high-water season should utilize a breakwater structure and mangroves with a woody stem.

AB  - Breeding of ornamental marine fishes was initiated in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, to protect reef ecosystems from destructive fishing and to supplement income of local communities. However, stress associated with captive breeding conditions could enhance vulnerability of fish to disease. Wild- and captive-bred clownfish Amphiprion percula showed clinical signs such as white spots and warts typically associated with lymphocystis disease. Sequencing a portion of the DNA polymerase gene confirmed the identity of a lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) in clownfish tissues that closely resembled LCDV from paradisefish; however, both strains were only 90% similar at the nucleotide level. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the LCDV is a new strain representing the first sequence of LCDV in A. percula. To determine the virus presence in clownfish and other ornamental marine species (OMS) in the hatchery, we developed conventional PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays that were comparatively sensitive at detecting the new LCDV strain. Among the PCR-tested clownfish, 19.4% (n = 14/72) were positive for the LCDV DNA that were either symptomatic or apparently healthy. Other OMS (n = 29) bred in the hatchery including seahorse Hippocampus spp., mandarin fish Synchiropus spp., and pajama cardinal fish Sphaeremia nepatoptera were negative by the LCDV PCR. The PCR and LAMP assays developed in this study will facilitate disease management by early detection of the LCDV and removal of potential reservoirs of the virus.

AB  - Bottom sediments are resuspended into the water column during dredging operations. These resuspended sediments are an often cited concern used to justify restrictions applied to dredging schedules in many areas of the USA. One example of a temporal restriction, commonly referred to as an environmental window, involves dredging schedules in the James River, Virginia, because of potential impacts on the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin). Yet, effects’ data are lacking to understand the effects of suspended sediments to C. virginica. To address this data gap, we performed a laboratory study mimicking sediment resuspension during annual dredging operations in the James River. Field-collected oysters were exposed for 7 days under flow-through conditions to 0, 100, 250, and 500-mg/L total suspended solids (TSS) in a unique exposure system where oyster movements could be electronically monitored. Endpoints analyzed were survival, percent of time open, total number of shell movements, weight change, and condition index. Data indicated no significant effects of suspended sediment on these endpoints after 7 days of exposure. Weight change in oysters attached vertically to monitor their movements was significantly less than in oysters not monitored in every treatment. No significant differences in condition index, an indicator of oyster growth sensitive to environmental pollutants, were observed among treatments measured 30 days postexposure. Correlations performed for each treatment among monitored oyster endpoints found significant negative associations between number of movements and percent open in the 100, 250, and 500-mg/L TSS treatments and in all treatments combined. These data will help reduce the uncertainty surrounding the effects of suspended sediments on C. virginica.

AB  - Boating and shipping operations, their associated activities and supporting infrastructure present a potential for environmental impacts. Such impacts include physical changes to bottom substrate and habitats from sources such as anchoring and mooring and vessel groundings, alterations to the physico-chemical properties of the water column and aquatic biota through the application of antifouling paints, operational and accidental discharges (ballast and bilge water, hydrocarbons, garbage and sewage), fauna collisions, and various other disturbances. Various measures exist to sustainably manage these impacts. In addition to a review of associated boating- and shipping-related environmental impacts, this paper provides an outline of the government- and industry-related measures relevant to achieving positive outcomes in an Australian context. Historically, direct regulations have been used to cover various environmental impacts associated with commercial, industrial, and recreational boating and shipping operations (e.g., MARPOL). The effectiveness of this approach is the degree to which compliance can be effectively monitored and enforced. To be effective, environmental managers require a comprehensive understanding of the full range of instruments available, and the respective roles they play in helping achieve positive environmental outcomes, including the pros and cons of the various regulatory alternatives.

AB  - Blue foods play a central role in food and nutrition security for billions of people and are a cornerstone of the livelihoods, economies, and cultures of many coastal and riparian communities. Blue foods are extraordinarily diverse, are often rich in essential micronutrients and fatty acids, and can often be produced in ways that are more environmentally sustainable than terrestrial animal-source foods. Capture fisheries constitute the largest wild-food resource for human extraction that would be challenging to replace. Yet, despite their unique value, blue foods have often been left out of food system analyses, policies, and investments. Here, we focus on three imperatives for realizing the potential of blue foods: (1) Bring blue foods into the heart of food system decision-making; (2) Protect and develop the potential of blue foods to help end malnutrition; and (3) Support the central role of small-scale actors in fisheries and aquaculture. Recognition of the importance of blue foods for food and nutrition security constitutes a critical justification to preserve the integrity and diversity of aquatic species and ecosystems. • Blue foods are diverse, rich in essential nutrients and fatty acids, and can offer sustainable alternatives to terrestrial animal-sourced foods. • Blue foods are often missing from food system analyses, policies, and investments. • This paper offers three recommendations for realizing the potential of blue foods in sustainable, healthy, and just food systems.

AB  - Bivalve shellfish aquaculture provides many benefits to society, beyond their traditional market value. This study collates the evidence available on the provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by the bivalve species commonly used in aquaculture. For the first time, it synthesises this evidence to provide a global assessment of the potential market and non‐market economic value of bivalve aquaculture. Bivalves are filter feeders, filtering water and particulates, creating substrates which provide habitat to act as nursery grounds for other species. Goods from provisioning services include meat, worth an estimated $23.9 billion as well as, pearls, shell and poultry grit, with oyster shell being the most important, with a global potential worth of $5.2 billion. The most important regulating services are nutrient remediation. Cultivated bivalves remove 49,000 tonnes of nitrogen and 6,000 tonnes of phosphorus, worth a potential $1.20 billion. Currently, there is little evidence on the cultural services per year of bivalve aquaculture, but we argue that these cultural values are broad ranging, although difficult to quantify. Our assessment indicates that the global, non‐food bivalve aquaculture services are worth $6.47 billion ($2.95 billion–9.99 billion) per annum. However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the true value of bivalve aquaculture as there are significant gaps in evidence of the value for a number of key services. The analysis presented here can be used to indicate the likely scale of payments for ecosystem services provided by bivalve aquaculture, prior to more detailed assessments

AB  - Behavioral sciences can advance conservation by systematically identifying behavioral barriers to conservation and how to best overcome them. Behavioral sciences have informed policy in many other realms (e.g., health, savings), but they are a largely untapped resource for conservation. We propose a set of guiding questions for applying behavioral insights to conservation policy. These questions help define the conservation problem as a behavior change problem, understand behavioral mechanisms and identify appropriate approaches for behavior change (awareness, incentives, nudges), and evaluate and adapt approaches based on new behavioral insights. We provide a foundation for the questions by synthesizing a wide range of behavior change models and evidence related to littering, water and energy conservation, and land management. We also discuss the methodology and data needed to answer these questions. We illustrate how these questions have been answered in practice to inform efforts to promote conservation for climate risk reduction. Although more comprehensive research programs to answer these questions are needed, some insights are emerging. Integrating two or more behavior change approaches that target multiple, context-dependent factors may be most successful; however, caution must be taken to avoid approaches that could undermine one another (e.g., economic incentives crowding out intrinsic incentives).

AB  - Based on Hurricane Ivan condition, numerical modeling of extreme waves under hurricane wind condition was investigated in this study in Pensacola Bay. Results from two popular wave models, STWAVE 4.0 and SWAN 48.8 models, were compared in three numerical experiments. Under regular incidental wave forcing, predictions of progressive wave heights from SWAN and STWAVE model are very close. However, under strong wind forcing condition of 120 mph wind speed, the spatial distributions of waves predicted by SWAN and STWAVE show substantial differences, even though the overall maximum wave height is close. Outside the bay, wind-induced wave heights predicted by SWAN are generally higher than those predicted by STWAVE. Inside the bay, along the direction from the southern shoreline to the northern shoreline, wave predicted by SWAN is generally higher than those predicted by STWAVE near the southern shoreline. It then becomes smaller than those estimated by STWAVE as wind driving waves to the north.

AB  - Barrier islands are susceptible to erosion, overwash, and breaching during intense storms. However, these processes are not represented typically in large-domain models for storm surge and coastal inundation. In this study, we explore the requirements for bridging the gap between dune-scale morphodynamic and region-scale flooding models. A high-resolution XBeach model is developed to represent the morphodynamics during Hurricane Isabel (2003) in the North Carolina (NC) Outer Banks. The model domain is extended to more than 30 km of Hatteras Island and is thus larger than in previous studies. The predicted dune erosion is in good agreement with post-storm observed topography, and an ‘‘excellent’’ Skill Score of 0.59 is obtained on this large domain. Sensitivity studies show the morphodynamic model accuracy is decreased as the mesh spacing is coarsened in the cross-shore direction, but the results are less sensitive to the alongshore resolution. A new metric to assess model skill, Water Overpassing Area ( W O A ), is introduced to account for the available flow pathway over the dune crest. Together, these findings allow for upscaled parameterizations of erosion in larger-domain models. The updated topography, obtained from XBeach prediction, is applied in a region-scale flooding model, thus allowing for enhanced flooding predictions in communities along the Outer Banks. It is found that, even using a fixed topography in region-scale model, the flooding predictions are improved significantly when post-storm topography from XBeach is implemented. These findings can be generalized to similar barrier island systems, which are common along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts.

AB  - Baggett et al. (2015) identified a set of three universal environmental variables to be monitored for evaluating all oyster habitat restoration projects: salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Perhaps evidencing a bias toward subtidal reefs, this set of parameters omits another first-order environmental factor, tidal emersion. Intertidal oyster reefs can be the dominant reef habitat in estuaries, with clear zonation in oyster performance across the intertidal exposure gradient. Therefore, we propose to include tidal emersion as a fourth universal environmental parameter when designing and evaluating oyster restoration projects to better encompass the whole environmental spectrum along which reefs occur.

AB  - Background Salt marshes lie between many human communities and the coast and have been presumed to protect these communities from coastal hazards by providing important ecosystem services. However, previous characterizations of these ecosystem services have typically been based on a small number of historical studies, and the consistency and extent to which marshes provide these services has not been investigated. Here, we review the current evidence for the specific processes of wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization and floodwater attenuation to determine if and under what conditions salt marshes offer these coastal protection services. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a thorough search and synthesis of the literature with reference to these processes. Seventy-five publications met our selection criteria, and we conducted meta-analyses for publications with sufficient data available for quantitative analysis. We found that combined across all studies (n = 7), salt marsh vegetation had a significant positive effect on wave attenuation as measured by reductions in wave height per unit distance across marsh vegetation. Salt marsh vegetation also had a significant positive effect on shoreline stabilization as measured by accretion, lateral erosion reduction, and marsh surface elevation change (n = 30). Salt marsh characteristics that were positively correlated to both wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization were vegetation density, biomass production, and marsh size. Although we could not find studies quantitatively evaluating floodwater attenuation within salt marshes, there are several studies noting the negative effects of wetland alteration on water quantity regulation within coastal areas. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that salt marshes have value for coastal hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation. Because we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this value, we propose that decision makers employ natural systems to maximize the benefits and ecosystem services provided by salt marshes and exercise caution when making decisions that erode these services.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport. METHODS: Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation. KEY RESULTS: At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 % greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection. CONCLUSIONS: We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate.

AB  - Backbarrier saltmarshes are considered carbon sinks; however, barrier island transgression and the associated processes of erosion and overwash are typically not included in coastal carbon budgets. Here, we present a carbon-budget model for transgressive barrier islands that includes a dynamic carbon-storage term, driven by backbarrier-marsh width, and a carbon-export term, driven by ocean and backbarrier shoreline erosion. To examine the impacts of storms, human disturbances and the backbarrier setting of a transgressive barrier island on carbon budgets and reservoirs, the model was applied to sites at Core Banks and Onslow Beach, NC, USA. Results show that shoreline erosion and burial of backbarrier marsh from washover deposition and dredge-spoil disposal temporarily transitioned each site into a net exporter (source) of carbon. The magnitude of the carbon reservoir was linked to the backbarrier setting of an island. Carbon reservoirs of study sites separated from the mainland by only backbarrier marsh (no lagoon) decreased for over a decade because carbon storage could not keep pace with erosion. With progressive narrowing of the backbarrier marsh, these barriers will begin to function more persistently as carbon sources until the reservoir is depleted at the point where the barrier welds with the mainland. Undeveloped barrier islands with wide lagoons are carbon sources briefly during erosive periods; however, at century time scales are net carbon importers (sinks) because new marsh habitat can form during barrier rollover. Human development on backbarrier saltmarsh serves to reduce the carbon storage capacity and can hasten the transition of an island from a sink to a source.

The definitive version was published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences 123 (2018): 867-878, doi:10.1002/2017JG004336.Salt marshes are sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide that respond to environmental changes related to sea level rise and climate. Here we assess how climatic variations affect marsh‐atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide in the short term and compare it to long‐term burial rates based on radiometric dating. The 5 years of atmospheric measurements show a strong interannual variation in atmospheric carbon exchange, varying from −104 to −233 g C m−2 a−1 with a mean of −179 ± 32 g C m−2 a−1. Variation in these annual sums was best explained by differences in rainfall early in the growing season. In the two years with below average rainfall in June, both net uptake and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were less than in the other three years. Measurements in 2016 and 2017 suggest that the mechanism behind this variability may be rainfall decreasing soil salinity which has been shown to strongly control productivity. The net ecosystem carbon balance was determined as burial rate from four sediment cores using radiometric dating and was lower than the net uptake measured by eddy covariance (mean: 110 ± 13 g C m−2 a−1). The difference between these estimates was significant and may be because the atmospheric measurements do not capture lateral carbon fluxes due to tidal exchange. Overall, it was smaller than values reported in the literature for lateral fluxes and highlights the importance of investigating lateral C fluxes in future studies.National Science Foundation Grant Numbers: OCE-1637630, OCE-1238212, 14263082018-08-0

AB  - Australia’s rapid coastal population growth coupled with the increased risk of hazards driven by climate change creates an urgent need to start adaptation planning for the future. The most common solutions for protecting the coast (seawalls, breakwaters) are expensive and non-adaptive (i.e., they need to be rebuilt, upgraded and maintained in response to a changing climate). There is international precedence for the development of nature-based solutions (i.e., the integration of natural habitats such as coastal vegetation and biogenic reefs) as a cost-effective and sustainable approach to shoreline protection from erosion and flooding. The development of nature-based approaches has been supported by large interdisciplinary teams to inform policy and decision-making. Nature-based coastal defence is currently not a tool widely used in Australia. Key to their wider implementation is: (1) improved scientific knowledge; (2) effective governance; and (3) social acceptance. Recently implemented pilot trials need to inform industry-accredited guidelines that can be integrated into coastal management and government policy.

AB  - At the coastline of the Carey Island, mangroves provide natural protection against the wind-driven coastal waves. The area is located at the west Malaysia within the waters of the Straits of Malacca. Recently, its coastline has been exposed to increasing rates of coastal erosion due to mangrove deforestation. In order to provide mitigating measures, it is necessary to study wave characteristics in this region. For this purpose, we collected 5 years (2009 to 2013) of hourly measurements for wind direction, wave height, wind speed and wave period. Moreover, we used the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate the wave period and height. The model was trained using the measured data. The validation of the model gave satisfactory R2 values of 0.8484 and 0.9496 for wave height and wave period, respectively. The findings from this study suggest that fuzzy logic based technique satisfactorily predicts the differences between multiple inputs and single output in terms of non-linear relationship. The developed model can be used to further study the effect of non-linear wind-driven waves on the depleting coastal mangrove forests in similar tropical and sub-tropical areas. We suggest further research to test the model in different geographical locations, such as in deep-ocean, narrow straits and other coastal sites, which were not covered in this study.

AB  - Assisting the natural recovery of coral reefs through local management actions is needed in response to increasing ecosystem disturbances in the Anthropocene. There is growing evidence that commonly used resilience-based passive management approaches may not be sufficient to maintain coral reef key functions. We synthesize and discuss advances in coral reef recovery research, and its application to coral reef conservation and restoration practices. We then present a framework to guide the decision-making of reef managers, scientists and other stakeholders, to best support reef recovery after a disturbance. The overall aim of this management framework is to catalyse reef recovery, to minimize recovery times, and to limit the need for ongoing management interventions into the future. Our framework includes two main stages: first, a prioritization method for assessment following a large-scale disturbance, which is based on a reef's social-ecological values, and on a classification of the likelihood of recovery or succession resulting in degraded, novel, hybrid or historical states. Second, a flow chart to assist with determining management actions for highly valued reefs. Potential actions are chosen based on the ecological attributes of the disturbed reef, defined during ecological assessments. Depending on the context, management actions may include (1) substrata rehabilitation actions to facilitate natural coral recruitment, (2) repopulating actions using active restoration techniques, (3) resilience-based management actions and (4) monitoring coral recruitment and growth to assess the effectiveness of management interventions. We illustrate the proposed decision framework with a case study of typhoon-damaged eastern outer reefs in Palau, Micronesia. The decisions made following this framework lead to the conclusion that some reefs may not return to their historical state for many decades. However, if motivation and funds are available, new management approaches can be explored to assist coral reefs at valued locations to return to a functional state providing key ecosystem services.

AB  - Assessing, implementing and monitoring ecosystem restoration can be a labor intensive process, often short term (< 3 years), and potentially destructive to the habitat. Advances in remote sensing technology are generating rapid, non-destructive methods for siting, executing and monitoring restoration efforts, particularly in fragile marine environments. Unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS), or drones, are a highly flexible method for accessing and remote sensing ecosystems with on-demand capabilities, greater resolution than sensors from satellites and occupied aircraft, and the ability to cover large areas quickly. With the variety of platforms and payloads available, UASs are providing a suite of tools for conservation practitioners to properly plan marine ecosystem restoration projects and evaluate their success. Both conventional and specialized sensors coupled with image processing techniques can be used to gauge impact to and recovery of entire ecological communities. For example, high-resolution, multispectral imaging allows for discernment of population changes across trophic levels, concurrent with the discrimination of species (including rare) across a landscape, and detection of vegetation stress. Structure from Motion photogrammetric processing provides centimeter-scale three-dimensional models of habitat structure to measure ecologically significant aspects like rugosity and assess their change through time. Water quality around a broad impacted area can be remotely monitored via a number of payloads before and after restoration. Additionally, specially designed payloads can be used to manually disperse seeds or materials for restoration applications without disturbing the habitat. UASs have increasing potential to reduce the costs (both time and money) associated with restoration efforts, making site assessment and long-term, broad-scale monitoring more achievable. Here we present a review of the applications of UASs in marine ecosystem restoration with an overview of the special considerations of using this technology in the marine environment.

AB  - As the frequency and intensity of storms increase, a growing need exists for resilient shore protection techniques that have both environmental and economic benefits. In addition to producing seafood, aquaculture farms may also provide coastal protection benefits either alone or with other nature-based structures. In this paper, a generalized three-layer frequency dependent theoretical model is derived for random wave attenuation due to presence of biomass within the water column. The biomass can be characterized as submerged, emerged, suspended and floating canopies that can consist of natural aquatic vegetation with potential aquaculture systems of kelp or mussels. The present analytical solutions can reduce to the solutions by Mendez and Losada (2004), Chen and Zhao (2012) and Jacobsen et al. (2019) for submerged rigid aquatic vegetation. The present theoretical model incorporates the motion of these canopies using a cantilever-beam model for slender components and a buoy-on-rope model for elements with concentrated mass and buoyancy. Analytical results are compared with existing laboratory and field datasets for submerged and suspended canopies. The theoretical model was then used (in a case study at a field site in Northeastern US) to investigate the capacity of suspended mussel farms with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to dissipate wave energy during a recent storm event. Compared to a dense SAV meadow in shallower water, the suspended aquaculture farms more effectively attenuate random waves with a smaller peak period and the higher frequency components of wave spectrum. The performance of suspended aquaculture farms is less affected by water level changes due to tides, surge and sea level rise, while the wave attenuation performance of SAV decreases with increasing water level due to decreased wave motion near the sea bed. Incorporating suspended aquaculture farms offshore significantly enhance the coastal protection effectiveness of SAV-based living shorelines and extend the wave attenuation capacity over a wider wave period and water level range. The combination of suspended aquaculture farms and traditional living shorelines provides a more effective nature-based coastal defense strategy than the traditional living shorelines alone.

AB  - As the artificial defences often required for urban and industrial development, such as seawalls, breakwaters, and bund walls, directly replace natural habitats, they may produce population fragmentation and a disruption of ecological connectivity, compromising the delivery of ecosystem services. Such problems have increasingly been addressed through “Working with Nature” (WwN) techniques, wherein natural features such as species and habitats are included as additional functional components within the design of built infrastructure. There now exists a convincing body of empirical evidence that WwN techniques can enhance the structural integrity of coastal works, and at the same time promote biodiversity and ecosystem services. While these benefits have often been achieved through modification of the hard surfaces of the coastal defence structures themselves, the desired ecological and engineering goals may often demand the creation of new soft substrates from sediment. Here we discuss the design considerations for creating new sediment habitats in the intertidal zone within new coastal infrastructure works. We focus on the sediment control structures required to satisfy the physiological and ecological requirements of seagrass and mangroves - two keystone intertidal species that are common candidates for restoration - and illustrate the concepts by discussing the case study of soft habitat creation within a major multi-commodity port.

AB  - As sea levels rise and the frequency of flooding events increases, so do efforts to stabilize coastal shorelines. Nature‐based solutions to shoreline stabilization (“green” solutions, as opposed to traditional “grey” shoreline hardening) have been increasingly adopted in the Gulf of Mexico and mid‐Atlantic regions of the United States, but they are only beginning to be implemented, documented, and understood in the northeastern United States. This case study contrasts two shoreline stabilization projects directly across from each other on the banks of the Mystic River, Boston Harbor, MA. These two projects, one private and one public, employ a spectrum of green‐grey shoreline stabilization techniques. Originally planned as traditional grey shoreline stabilizations, both projects shifted toward greener solutions due to local environmental group advocacy, highlighting the influence of outside groups as advocates for nature‐based solutions. This study documents the evolution of both projects, highlighting common challenges in permitting and vegetation maintenance, as well as critical differences in project goals, funding sources, and biodiversity impacts.

AB  - As exposure to coastal hazards increases there is growing interest in nature-based solutions for risk reduction. This study uses high-resolution flood and loss models to quantify the impacts of coastal wetlands in the northeastern USA on (i) regional flood damages by Hurricane Sandy and (ii) local annual flood losses in Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey. Using an extensive database of property exposure, the regional study shows that wetlands avoided $625 Million in direct flood damages during Hurricane Sandy. The local study combines these models with a database of synthetic storms in Ocean County and estimates a 16% average reduction in annual flood losses by salt marshes with higher reductions at lower elevations. Together, the studies quantify the risk reduction ecosystem services of marsh wetlands. Measuring these benefits in collaboration with the risk modelling industry is crucial for assessing risk accurately and, where appropriate, aligning conservation and risk reduction goals.

AB  - As ecosystem-based adaptation to global change is gaining ground, strategies to protect coastal and estuarine areas from increasing flood hazards are starting to consist of natural tidal wetland conservation and restoration in addition to conventional coastal defense structures. In this study, the capacity of tidal wetlands to locally attenuate peak water levels during storm tides is analyzed using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (TELEMAC2D) for a 3000 ha intertidal marsh (SW Netherlands). Model results indicate that peak water level reduction largely varies between individual flooding events and between different locations in the marsh. Model scenarios with variable dike positions show that attenuation rates can be minimized by blockage and set up of water levels against dikes or other structures confining the marsh size. This blockage only affects peak water level attenuation across wetlands if the duration of the flood wave is long compared to the marsh size. A minimum marsh width of 6–10 km is required to completely avoid blockage effects for the storm tidal cases assessed in this study. If blockage does not affect flood wave propagation, variations in attenuation rates between different locations in the marsh and between tides with varying high water levels can be explained with a single relationship based on the ratio between the water volume on the marsh platform and the total water volume on the platform and in the channels. Attenuation starts to occur when this ratio exceeds 0.2–0.4 and increases from there on up to a maximum of 29 cm/km for a ratio of about 0.85. Furthermore, model scenarios with varying marsh channel depth show that marsh scale attenuation rates increase by up to 4 cm/km if the channel elevation is raised by 0.7 m on average. Conversely, marsh scale attenuation rates decrease by up to 2 cm/km for scenarios in which the channels are lowered by 0.9 m on average. The marsh platform elevation has little effect on the maximum attenuation, but it determines which tides are attenuated. In particular, only overmarsh tides that inundate the platform are attenuated, while undermarsh tides that only flood the marsh channels are not attenuated or even amplified. These findings may assist coastal communities and managers in the optimization of the coastal defense function of tidal wetlands in combination with dikes.

AB  - As coastal habitats face unprecedented pressure globally, there is a need to better understand how revegetation can fortify or restore biodiversity. We examined the early-stage outcomes of mangrove revegetation efforts for benthic invertebrate communities within degraded mangrove habitats in south eastern Brazil. We followed changes in macrofaunal abundance and species richness within small-scale Avicennia schaueriana revegetation plots over a 12month period. The assemblages of revegetation plots (RP) became progressively more diverse when compared to structural (SC) and blank controls (BC). The trajectory of change also differed with RP communities demonstrating convergence with those of remnant mangrove forest. After 12months, RP had greater abundances of crustaceans (41%) and polychaetes (13%) as well as higher but variable numbers of gastropods and bivalves than both SC and BC. A spatial examination of revegetation outcomes showed that success may vary across sheltered vs. exposed coastal microhabitats. Indeed, subsequent analysis using generalised linear mixed models pointed to a stronger influence of tidal height, than many of the commonly attributed sedimentary variables such as grain-size and organic matter content as determinants of community structure. Given the encouraging results of this study, we advocate an intensification of revegetation initiatives to augment natural recovery, increase benthic biodiversity and restore ecosystems services to degraded coasts.

However, nutrient removal performance will depend on the design to effectively infiltrate roadway runoff and the capacity of subsurface media to sequester or remove nutrients from infiltrated runoff. The objective of this study is to test hydraulic and nutrient removal performance of a roadside VFS over varied rainfall-runoff event sizes and filter widths. Two identical 1:1 scale physical models of roadway shoulders and embankments, one containing engineered media (Treatment model) and the other without (Control model), were tested with simulated rainfall and runoff from 1- and 2-lane roadways. Overall, 32 paired hydraulic experiments and 28 paired nutrient removal experiments were completed to assess performance across frequent and extreme rainfall-runoff events. The results indicate that scalability of performance with filter width varied by parameter. Runoff generation scaled predictably with filter width, as runoff generated close to the pavement and total infiltration increased with filter length. A 6 m-wide VFS containing the engineered media infiltrated all rainfall-runoff except during the most extreme storm events (1-h storms of 76.2 mm and 50.8 mm), where respectively 35% and 22% of rainfall-runoff did not infiltrate and left the system as surface runoff. A majority of phosphorus was retained within a 1.5 m filter while nitrate removal was not observed until 6 m. The Treatment model strongly outperformed the Control model with respect to nitrate (arithmetic mean ± standard deviation of 94 ± 6% reduction vs. 23 ± 64% increase, p < .001) and total nitrogen removal (80 ± 5% vs. 38 ± 23% reduction, p < .001) due to higher rates of microbially-mediated denitrification in the Treatment model. The two models performed comparably with regard to phosphorus reduction (84 ± 9% vs. 82 ± 12% reduction). A minimum 6 m filter width is recommended to ensure sufficient infiltration of runoff and nitrogen removal. Results of this study address uncertainty regarding nutrient removal performance of VFS in urban runoff applications and highlight a potential strategy for standardizing VFS performance across varied soil properties by including engineered media within the filter.

AB  - Artificial structures are proliferating in the marine environment, resulting in ‘ocean sprawl’. In light of the potential environmental impacts of this, such as habitat loss and alteration, it is becoming increasingly important to incorporate ecologically-sensitive design into artificial marine structures. The principles of eco-engineering and green infrastructure are embedded in urban planning practice for terrestrial and freshwater development projects. In marine planning, however, eco-engineering of blue-green infrastructure remains an emerging concept. This note provides a UK perspective on the progress towards uptake of eco-engineering approaches for enhancing biodiversity on artificial marine structures. We emphasise that, despite a clear ‘policy pull’ to incorporate biodiversity enhancements in marine structures, a range of proof-of-concept evidence that it is possible to achieve, and strong cross-sectoral stakeholder support, there are still few examples of truly and purposefully-designed blue-green artificial structures in the UK. We discuss the barriers that remain and propose a strategy towards effective implementation. Our strategy outlines a step-wise approach to: (1) strengthening the evidence base for what enhancements can be achieved in different scenarios; (2) improving clarity on the predicted benefits and associated costs of enhancements; (3) packaging the evidence in a useful form to support planning and decision-making; and (4) encouraging implementation as routine practice. Given that ocean sprawl is a growing problem globally, the perspective presented here provides valuable insight and lessons for other nations at their various states of progress towards this same goal.

AB  - Artificial reefs provide substrates that facilitate the rapid recruitment of marine biota such as corals and fish, and are commonly employed as coral restoration tools to assist recovery in degraded areas. While this strategy is successful in the immediate years post-deployment, its contribution to restoration over longer time scales is less well understood. The biological communities on Reef Enhancement Units (REUs), which had been deployed for more than a decade on Singapore's sediment-affected coral reefs, were surveyed. The diversity of sessile lifeforms on the REUs was significantly higher in 2014 (H′ = 1.03) than 2004 (H′ = 0.60). Hard corals and coralline algae contributed most to the temporal dissimilarity and turf algae remained the dominant lifeform category in both years. In 2014, hard corals and abiotic components contributed most to the spatial dissimilarity among the six REU plots that were surveyed. Shannon diversity values of these plots ranged from 0.74–1.3. Scleractinian cover ranged from 0.4–31.5% and differed significantly among the plots. The REUs also augmented ecosystem functioning at their respective plots. Colonies from 10 of the 30 scleractinian genera recorded were sexually mature, and a total of 119 sessile and mobile reef taxa utilized the REUs for food and habitat. The results demonstrate that artificial reefs can contribute to the development of biological communities and ecosystem functioning in degraded coral habitats over the long run, and underscore the need for long-term monitoring to validate the effectiveness of reef restoration efforts.

AB  - Artificial reefs have proven to be an optimal and effective solution in stabilizing coastlines around the world. They are submerged structures that imitate the protection service provided by natural reefs accomplishing the functions of dissipating wave energy and protecting beach morphology, but also being an ecological solution. In this paper, 2D small-scale experiments were performed to analyze the hydrodynamic, morphological, and ecological behavior of an artificial reef constructed of modular elements. Two typical beach-dune profiles were constructed in a wave flume over which two locations of an artificial reef were tested. From these tests, transmission coefficients were obtained as well as the beach profile response to the presence of the artificial reef. These results are used to discuss about the hydrodynamic, morphological, and ecological performance of the artificial reef. The proposed artificial reef showed good morphological performance while its hydrodynamic function had limited success. In turn, the ecologic performance was theoretically addressed.

AB  - Artificial reefs are being implemented around the world for their multi-functions including coastal protection and environmental improvement. To better understand the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic roles of an artificial reef (AR) in beach protection, a series of experiments were conducted in a 50 m-long wave flume configured with a 1:10 sloping beach and a model AR (1.8 m long × 0.3 m high) with 0.2 m submergence depth. Five regular and five irregular wave conditions were generated on two types of beach profiles (with/without model AR) to study the cross-shore hydrodynamic and morphological evolution process. The influences of AR on the processes are concluded as follows: (1) AR significantly decreases the incident wave energy, and its dissipation effect differs for higher and lower harmonics under irregular wave climates; (2) AR changes the cross-shore patterns of hydrodynamic factors (significant wave height, wave skewness and asymmetry, and undertow), leading to the movement of shoaling and breaking zones; (3) the beach evolution is characterized by a sandbar and a scarp which respectively sit at a higher and lower location on the profile with AR than natural beach without AR; (4) the cross-shore morphological features indicate that AR can lead to beach state transformation toward reflective state; (5) the scarp retreat process can be described by a model where the scarp location depends linearly on the natural exponential of time with the fitting parameters determined by wave run-up reduced by AR. This study demonstrates cross-shore effects of AR as a beach protection structure that changes wave dynamics in surf and swash zone, reduces offshore sediment transport, and induces different morphological features.

AB  - Artificial reefs and, more recently, ecoengineering are frequently advocated as possible tools to counteract the loss of tropical coral reefs worldwide. Despite increasing availability of novel materials, there is limited understanding of how different materials and their physical and chemical properties can influence coral recruitment success and early benthic community development. This study investigated the efficacy of several innovative materials as recruitment substrates for corals and other sessile benthic communities. Stacks of vertically oriented tiles made of eight innovative materials and two common (control) materials were deployed for 6 months during major coral spawning events on the forereef of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Tiles were separated from their neighbors by 15 mm to mimic cryptic habitats that are sheltered from predation and typically favored by coral recruits. Six innovative materials, including 3D printed concrete, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with chitosan coating, fiberglass polymer, and flax-based polylactic acid, produced similar coral recruitment to control materials (Portland concrete and PVC). Two materials (porous concrete and ceramic foam) produced lower recruitment. Porous concrete was characterized by a high abundance of non-coralline encrusting red algae, which negatively correlated with coral recruitment, while ceramic foam was prone to erosion. The results suggest the structural micro-complexity and durability of an artificial material and the composition of the benthic communities colonizing it can strongly influence coral recruitment. This study highlights several innovative materials as suitable recruitment substrates for coral restoration and provides a better understanding of the properties of artificial materials that are critical for coral recruitment success.

AB  - Artificial reefs (ARs) have been used on coral reefs for ecological research, conservation, and socio-cultural purposes since the 1980s. We examined spatio-temporal patterns in AR deployment in tropical and subtropical coral reefs (up to 35° latitude) and evaluated their efficacy in meeting conservation objectives, using a systematic review of the scientific literature. Most deployments (136 studies) were in the North Atlantic and Central Indo-Pacific in 1980s - 2000s, with a pronounced shift to the Western Indo-Pacific in 2010s. Use of ARs in reef restoration or stressor mitigation increased markedly in response to accelerating coral decline over the last 2 decades. Studies that evaluated success in meeting conservation objectives (n = 51) commonly reported increasing fish abundance (55%), enhancing habitat quantity (31%) or coral cover (27%), and conserving target species (24%). Other objectives included stressor mitigation (22%), provision of coral nursery habitat (14%) or source populations (2%) and addressing socio-cultural and economic values (16%). Fish (55% of studies) and coral (53%) were the most commonly monitored taxa. Success in achieving conservation objectives was reported in 33 studies. Success rates were highest for provision of nursery habitat and increasing coral cover (each 71%). Increasing fish abundance or habitat quantity, mitigating environmental impacts, and attaining socio-cultural objectives were moderately successful (60-64%); conservation of target species was the least successful (42%). Failure in achieving objectives commonly was attributed to poor AR design or disruption by large-scale bleaching events. The scale of ARs generally was too small (m2 -10s m2) to address regional losses in coral cover, and study duration too short (< 5 years) to adequately assess ecologically relevant trends in coral cover and community composition. ARs are mostly likely to aid in reef conservation and restoration by providing nursery habitat for target species or recruitment substrate for corals and other organisms. Promoting local socio-cultural values also has potential for regional or global impact by increasing awareness of coral reef decline, if prioritized and properly monitored.

AB  - Artificial Reefs (AR) show a wide diversity and vary in their construction materials, shape and purpose, as illustrated by the present analysis of 127 scientific papers. AR have been deployed for different purposes, including fisheries improvement, ecological restoration of marine habitats, coastal protection or purely scientific research. Statistical analyses using 67 variables allow us to characterize the design, objectives and monitoring strategies used for AR. An effectiveness indicator comprised of three categories (low, moderate and high) was adapted from previous studies and applied to the present dataset in terms of the objectives defined in each scientific paper. The effectiveness of various monitoring approaches was investigated and recommendations were formulated regarding environmental parameters and the assessment of ecological processes as a function of AR type. These analyses showed that inert materials like concrete associated with biomimetic designs increase the benefits of reefs to the local environment. This study also compared effectiveness between the different economic, ecological or scientific objectives of AR projects and reveals that fisheries projects showed the highest efficiencies but points out the weakness of environmental assessments for this type of project. In conclusion, the analyses presented here highlight the need to use a panel of complementary monitoring techniques, independently of the initial purpose of the artificial structures, to properly assess the impact of such structures on the local environment. It is recommended to adopt approaches that associate structural and functional ecology. An improved characterization of the role of AR should be integrated into future assessments, taking into account the complex framework of ecosystem structure and trophic relationships.

AB  - Artificial coastal dykes have been widely built to prevent erosion, or to accelerate sedimentation processes in saltmarshes. To investigate the sediment dynamic changes induced by construction of dykes, three observation stations were set around a dyke within an expanding Scirpus mariqueter saltmarsh, in southern Hangzhou Bay. The hydrodynamics of the study area was dominated by tidal currents. The presence of dyke, in combination with the adjacent tidal creek, altered the hydrodynamic boundary conditions, thereby affecting the flow field. When the tidal flows approaching the dyke, the speed was accelerated at the head of the dyke and then decreased at the rear, due to the narrowing effect of the dyke head. Turbulence intensity around the dyke showed a similar pattern to that of the tidal flows. The net sediment input behind the dyke is approximately 2.3 times of that at the dyke head, illustrating sediment deposition in the back region of the dyke. As a result, flows entrained the sediments and then deposited behind the dyke to cause a local accretion to promote saltmarsh vegetation succession. The construction of dykes should be taken into account for future coastal wetland management. • In situ sediment dynamic observation was conducted around a dyke in saltmarsh. • Dyke altered tidal flows and caused sediment transport towards the rear region. • Construction of the dyke drove vegetation succession in the saltmarsh.

AB  - Arc StormSurge is a data model that integrates geographic information systems and the hurricane wave and surge model SWAN+ADCIRC, which is the coupling of the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model and the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model. The Arc StormSurge data model is a geodatabase, which is a relational database that can contain georeferenced information. It includes feature classes in feature datasets and tables, all related among them through relationship classes, and raster catalogs and grids. In addition to the data model schema, Arc StormSurge includes a number of pre- and post-processing tools that help integrate spatial data and numerical modeling. As an illustration, Arc StormSurge was used to support the modeling of Hurricane Bret, which made landfall in the Corpus Christi area in Texas in 1999. By using Arc StormSurge, it was possible to take advantage of already available geo-referenced information (e.g., base maps, land cover datasets, and monitoring station locations) for the model setup, and for identifying spatial patterns in the model results by presenting them in map format.

AB  - Aquatic vegetation in the coastal zone attenuates wave energy and reduces the risk of coastal hazards, e.g., flooding. Besides the attenuation of sea-swell waves, vegetation may also affect infragravity-band (IG) waves and wave setup. To date, knowledge on the effect of vegetation on IG waves and wave setup is lacking, while they are potentially important parameters for coastal risk assessment. In this study, the storm impact model XBeach is extended with formulations for attenuation of sea-swell and IG waves, and wave setup effects in two modes: the sea-swell wave phase-resolving (nonhydrostatic) and the phase-averaged (surfbeat) mode. In surfbeat mode, a wave shape model is implemented to capture the effect of nonlinear wave-vegetation interaction processes on wave setup. Both modeling modes are verified using data from two flume experiments with mimic vegetation and show good skill in computing the sea-swell and IG wave transformation, and wave setup. In surfbeat mode, the wave setup prediction greatly improves when using the wave shape model, while in nonhydrostatic mode (nonlinear) intrawave effects are directly accounted for. Subsequently, the model is used for a range of coastal geomorphological configurations by varying bed slope and vegetation extent. The results indicate that the effect of wave-vegetation interaction on wave setup may be relevant for a range of typical coastal geomorphological configurations (e.g., relatively steep to gentle slope coasts fronted by vegetation).

AB  - Aquatic vegetation can shelter coastlines from energetic waves and tidal currents, sometimes enabling accretion of fine sediments. Simulation of flow and sediment transport within submerged canopies requires quantification of vegetation geometry. However, field surveys used to determine vegetation geometry can be limited by the time required to obtain conventional caliper and ruler measurements. Building on recent progress in photogrammetry and computer vision, we present a method for reconstructing three-dimensional canopy geometry. The method was used to survey a dense canopy of aerial mangrove roots, called pneumatophores, in Vietnam’s Mekong River Delta. Photogrammetric estimation of geometry required 1) taking numerous photographs at low tide from multiple viewpoints around 1 m2 quadrats, 2) computing relative camera locations and orientations by triangulation of key features present in multiple images and reconstructing a dense 3D point cloud, and 3) extracting pneumatophore locations and diameters from the point cloud data. Step 3) was accomplished by a new ‘sector-slice’ algorithm, yielding geometric parameters every 5 mm along a vertical profile. Photogrammetric analysis was compared with manual caliper measurements. In all 5 quadrats considered, agreement was found between manual and photogrammetric estimates of stem number, and of number × mean diameter, which is a key parameter appearing in hydrodynamic models. In two quadrats, pneumatophores were encrusted with numerous barnacles, generating a complex geometry not resolved by hand measurements. In remaining cases, moderate agreement between manual and photogrammetric estimates of stem diameter and solid volume fraction was found. By substantially reducing measurement time in the field while capturing in greater detail the 3D structure, photogrammetry has potential to improve input to hydrodynamic models, particularly for simulations of flow through large-scale, heterogenous canopies.

AB  - Aquaculture is a critical food source for the world's growing population, producing 52% of the aquatic animal products consumed. Marine aquaculture (mariculture) generates 37.5% of this production and 97% of the world's seaweed harvest. Mariculture products may offer a climate-friendly, high-protein food source, because they often have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints than do the equivalent products farmed on land. However, sustainable intensification of low-emissions mariculture is key to maintaining a low GHG footprint as production scales up to meet future demand. We examine the major GHG sources and carbon sinks associated with fed finfish, macroalgae and bivalve mariculture, and the factors influencing variability across sectors. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for GHG emissions reductions and carbon storage, including accounting for interactions between mariculture operations and surrounding marine ecosystems. By linking the provision of maricultured products to GHG abatement opportunities, we can advance climate-friendly practices that generate sustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes.

AB  - Anthropogenic stressors can affect subtidal communities within the land-water interface. Increasing anthropogenic activities, including upland and shoreline development, threaten ecologically important species in these habitats. In this study, we examined the consequences of anthropogenic stressors on benthic macrofaunal communities in 14 subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay. We investigated how subestuary upland use (forested, agricultural, developed land) and shoreline development (riprap and bulkhead compared to marsh and beach) affected density, biomass, and diversity of benthic infauna. Upland and shoreline development were parameters included in the most plausible models among a candidate set compared using corrected Akaike’s Information Criterion. For benthic macrofauna, density tended to be lower in subestuaries with developed or mixed compared to forested or agricultural upland use. Benthic biomass was significantly lower in subestuaries with developed compared to forested upland use, and biomass declined exponentially with proportion of near-shore developed land. Benthic density did not differ significantly among natural marsh, beach, and riprap habitats, but tended to be lower adjacent to bulkhead shorelines. Including all subestuaries, there were no differences in diversity by shoreline type. In low salinities, benthic Shannon (H′) diversity tended to be higher adjacent to natural marshes compared to the other habitats, and lower adjacent to bulkheads, but the pattern was reversed in high salinities. Sediment characteristics varied by shoreline type and contributed to differences in benthic community structure. Given the changes in the infaunal community with anthropogenic stressors, subestuary upland and shoreline development should be minimized to increase benthic production and subsequent trophic transfer within the food web.

AB  - Anthropogenic modifications of estuarine environments, including shoreline hardening and corresponding alteration of water quality, are accelerating worldwide as human population increases in coastal regions. Estuarine fish species inhabiting temperate ecosystems are adapted to extreme variations in environmental conditions including water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen across seasonal, daily, and hourly time scales. The present research utilized quantitative sampling to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of shore-zone estuarine fish species in association with four unique shoreline types across a range of water temperature and dissolved oxygen conditions. Fish were collected from the intertidal and shallow subtidal region of four shoreline types, Spartina alterniflora marsh, Phragmites australis marsh, riprap, and bulkhead, in the summer and fall of 2009 and 2010. Analyses were performed to (1) compare mean fish density among shoreline types across all water conditions and (2) explore relationships of the complete fish assemblage, three functional species groupings, and two fish species (Fundulus heteroclitus and Menidia menidia) to unique shoreline/water conditions. Significantly greater mean fish densities were found along S. alterniflora shorelines than armored shorelines. Several metrics including fish density, species richness, and occurrence rates suggest S. alterniflora shorelines may serve as a form of refuge habitat during periods of low dissolved oxygen and high temperatures for various species, particularly littoral-demersal species including F. heteroclitus. Potential mechanisms that could contribute to a habitat providing refuge during adverse water quality conditions include tempering of the adverse condition (decreased temperatures, increased dissolved oxygen), predation protection, and increased foraging opportunities.

AB  - An increasing abundance of projects demonstrate that coastal management strategies that align engineering and ecological objectives can deliver a wide range benefits. Better understanding how these strategies fare under stress is crucially important, including in comparison to traditional coastal engineering approaches, in order to inform where they might be a viable alternative or complement to conventional coastal storm risk management. In particular, the prospect that these strategies may be able to recover from disturbances and adapt to better survive future disturbances with minimal or no intervention is compelling. However, no formal accounting method exists to assess how ecosystem-based approaches contribute to the resilience of coastal systems, that is, their ability to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt from stressors. An assessment rubric is developed and demonstrated for Engineering With Nature® projects and limitations and ways forward are discussed.

AB  - An estimated 100 million people inhabit coastal areas at risk from flooding and erosion due to climate change. Seagrass meadows, like other coastal ecosystems, attenuate waves. Due to inconsistencies in how wave attenuation is measured results cannot be directly compared. We synthesised data from laboratory and field experiments of seagrass-wave attenuation by converting measurements to drag coefficients (C(D)). Drag coefficients varied from 0.02-5.12 with C(D) = 0.74 for studies conducted in turbulent flow in non-storm conditions. A statistical model suggested that seagrass species affects C(D) although the exact mechanism remains unclear. A wave model using the estimated C(D) as an input parameter demonstrated that wave attenuation increased with meadow length, shoot density, shoot width and canopy height. Findings can be used to estimate wave attenuation by seagrass, in any given set of conditions.

AB  - Although the concept of ecosystem sustainability has a long-term focus, it is often viewed from a static system perspective. Because most ecosystems are dynamic, we explore sustainability assessments from three additional perspectives: resilient systems; systems where tipping points occur; and systems subject to episodic resetting. Whereas foundations of ecosystem resilience originated in ecology, recent discussions have focused on geophysical attributes, and it is recognized that dynamic system components may not return to their former state following perturbations. Tipping points emerge when chronic changes (typically anthropogenic, but sometimes natural) push ecosystems to thresholds that cause collapse of process and function and may become permanent. Ecosystem resetting occurs when episodic natural disasters breach thresholds with little or no warning, resulting in long-term changes to environmental attributes or ecosystem function. An example of sustainability assessment of ecosystem goods and services along the Gulf Coast (USA) demonstrates the need to include both the resilient and dynamic nature of biogeomorphic components. Mountain road development in northwest Yunnan, China, makes rivers and related habitat vulnerable to tipping points. Ecosystems reset by natural disasters are also presented, emphasizing the need to understand the magnitude frequency and interrelationships among major disturbances, as shown by (i) the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and resulting tsunami, including how unsustainable urban development exacerbates geodisaster propagation, and (ii) repeated major earthquakes and associated geomorphic and vegetation disturbances in Papua New Guinea. Although all of these ecosystem perturbations and shifts are individually recognized, they are not embraced in contemporary sustainable decision making.

AB  - Alteration of estuarine shorelines associated with increased urbanization can significantly impact biota and food webs. This study determined the impact of shoreline alteration on growth and movement of the estuarine fish Fundulus heteroclitus in a tributary of the Delaware Coastal Bays. Fundulus heteroclitus is abundant along the east coast of the USA, and is an important trophic link between marsh and subtidal estuary. The restricted home range of F. heteroclitus allowed discrete sampling, and fish growth comparisons, along 35–65-m long stretches of fringing Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis marsh, riprap, and bulkhead. Fundulus heteroclitus were tagged with decimal Coded Wire Tags. Of 725 tagged F. heteroclitus, 89 were recaptured 30–63 days later. Mean growth rate (0.06–0.15 mm day−1 across all shoreline types) was greatest at riprap, lowest at Spartina and Phragmites, and intermediate at bulkhead, where growth was not significantly different from any other shoreline. This suggests that discernible environments exist along different shoreline types, even at the scale of tens of meters. No difference in movement distance was detected at different shoreline types; most individuals displayed a high degree of site fidelity. Forty-seven percent were recaptured within 5 m of their tagging location, although alongshore movements up to 475 m were recorded. Estimates of relative F. heteroclitus productivity, using relative density data from a concurrent study, were highest along Spartina and Phragmites, intermediate at riprap, and lowest at bulkhead. Therefore, despite greater growth rates along riprap than at vegetated shores, armoring reduces abundance sufficiently to negatively impact localized productivity of F. heteroclitus.

AB  - Along the Upper Gulf of Thailand, coastal fences and breakwaters have been constructed using bamboo since 2005. Despite their potential benefits, bamboo structures disintegrate within seven years releasing floating debris which severely damages mangrove tree stems. The aim of the study was to investigate whether such stem damage resulted in the decline of Avicennia spp. stands along the Upper Gulf of Thailand. Tree health assessments were conducted to assess the probability of crown dieback in damaged and undamaged trees. Satellite-derived time-series of vegetation indices were used to detect long-term forest decline. In contrast to the unaffected landward mangroves, seaward mangroves were unable to recover from insect-induced defoliation events after the collapse of a nearby fence. Furthermore, there was a significantly higher probability that damaged trees showed signs of moderate-to-severe crown dieback. It is recommended that bamboo fences be secured by replacing individual stems before they become detached.

AB  - Along the North American Mid-Atlantic coast, soft-sediment shorelines are armored with hard substrata, such as riprap (rock revetments), for erosion protection. These structures are valuable for determining anthropogenic effects on marine ecosystems, and riprap potentially represents a habitat similar to an “emerging ecosystem” with productive species assemblages. The goals of this project were to (i) quantify species diversity, secondary production, and vertical distribution associated with armored (i.e., riprap) habitats in various locations in Chesapeake Bay and (ii) compare benthic epifaunal production on riprap with infaunal production on natural soft-sediment habitats in a system where natural rocky intertidal habitats are absent. Density, diversity, and secondary production of benthic epifauna on riprap and benthic infauna were compared in adjacent habitats in lower (Lynnhaven River) and upper (Patuxent River) Chesapeake Bay. To compare riprap habitat between tributaries that differed in physical characteristics and with natural rocky intertidal habitats from other systems, oyster, mussel, and barnacle vertical distribution on riprap in southern (Lynnhaven River) and northern (Piankatank River) locations was quantified. The hypothesis was that riprap assemblages and secondary production would differ between rivers and among regions due to differences in physical variables such as temperature (thermal stress in northern locations), or osmotic stress (greater upriver), and patterns would be comparable to natural rocky habitats. We predicted that productivity would be relatively high and relate positively with diversity on riprap, suggesting that it is a habitat within an “emerging ecosystem” where new combinations of species and habitat appear. Benthic epifaunal production on riprap was sevenfold greater than natural infaunal production, and both tended to be highest in the Lynnhaven. Vertical distribution on riprap was similar to that on natural rocky intertidal habitats: oyster and mussel densities tended to be highest in the mid- and low-intertidal zones, whereas barnacle density was greatest in the high intertidal at the southern location and the low intertidal in the northern location. Secondary productivity on riprap was high relative to the natural, infaunal, soft-bottom habitat in this area. Species richness and epifaunal non-oyster production were positively related to oyster production. We demonstrate that intertidal riprap-armored shorelines are a productive novel habitat in an emerging ecosystem, and they enhance species diversity, abundance, and production. Thus, riprap shorelines mimic the ecological characteristics of natural hard-bottom habitats, and they may contribute substantially to ecosystem function throughout the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts due to riprap's widespread use and distribution.

AB  - Along densely populated coasts, the armoring of shorelines is a prevalent cause of natural habitat loss and degradation. This article explores the values and decision making of waterfront homeowners and identifies two interlinked and potentially reversible drivers of coastal degradation. We discovered that: (1) misperceptions regarding the environmental impacts and cost-effectiveness of different shoreline conditions was common and may promote armoring; and (2) many homeowners reported only altering their shorelines in response to damage caused by armoring on neighboring properties. Collectively, these findings suggest that a single homeowner's decision may trigger cascading degradation along a shoreline, which highlights the necessity of protecting existing large stretches of natural shoreline. However, our study also found that most homeowners were concerned with environmental impacts and preferred the aesthetics of natural landscapes, both of which could indicate nascent support and pathways for conservation initiatives along residential shorelines.

AB  - Aim The aim was to quantify the influence of urban land use and urban populations on mangrove systems around the world over the past four decades. Location Global. Time period 1997–2015. Major taxa studied Avicennia, Laguncularia, Rhizophora, Aves, Actinopterygii, Crustacea and Mollusca. Methods This review extracts results of mangrove studies on forest cover and structure, nutrient dynamics, sediment contamination and faunal community assemblages conducted around the world between 1997 and 2015. These observations are then correlated with surrounding social–ecological spatial characteristics pertaining to urbanization. Results Mangrove coverage in large cities is mostly decreasing, and at a greater rate than means for corresponding countries. Both expanding urbanization and existing agriculture are most strongly correlated with mangrove losses, which are primarily occurring 5–10 km from urban areas. Along a gradient of surrounding urban land use, mangrove leaf δ15N content increases, and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios decrease. Sediment concentrations of almost all examined heavy metals are strongly and positively correlated with both surrounding urban and mangrove extent. The diversity of subsistence fisheries increases significantly with surrounding mangrove extent. Worm diversity decreases with increasing surrounding urbanness (urban index), and mangrove specialist bird diversity increases with increasing surrounding urban coverage as well as with mangrove coverage. Main conclusions Mangroves increasingly coexist within highly anthropogenic landscapes along urbanized coasts. Most ecological reports of these systems, however, lack quantified representations of the urban landscape, such as population density or impervious surface coverage. The results of this analysis suggest that some of the reported patterns of forest coverage, nitrogen dynamics, heavy metal contamination and faunal community assemblages in isolated urban mangroves are systemic across the world. These findings are particularly pertinent to 21st century tropical coastlines, which will see some of the greatest urbanization rates over the next century and will guide urban mangrove ecology towards the development of more synergistic social–ecological systems.

AB  - Aim Estuaries world-wide have been modified or fragmented due to human stressors in their terrestrial and aquatic components. Estuary fragmentation often results in reductions in species richness, diversity and connectivity. Effects of human modification on estuaries have been well studied, but less is known about how land use alters connectivity of the terrestrial–aquatic ecotone. We studied the relationship between terrestrial–aquatic connectivity and the distribution of an estuarine turtle, diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin). Location Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, USA. Methods We conducted diamondback terrapin surveys at 165 sites from late spring to mid-summer in 2012 and 2013. We evaluated associations between terrapin occurrence, land use, salt marsh, shoreline armouring and crabbing intensity in concentric–circular neighbourhoods ranging from 0.27 to 2 km to cover daily and annual terrapin movements. We used occupancy modelling and model averaging to identify key terrestrial and aquatic variables explaining heterogeneity in terrapin occupancy. We evaluated the final model with an independent data set and identified occurrence thresholds for key variables. Results Diamondback terrapin occupy areas with ≥ 10% of marsh within a 750-m neighbourhood, ≤ 17% armoured shoreline within a 1-km neighbourhood, ≤ 20% of agriculture within a 500-m neighbourhood, ≤ 33% low-density housing within a 270-m neighbourhood and ≤ 9 active crab pots within a 270-m neighbourhood. Our model performed well when evaluated with an independent data set. Main conclusions We are the first to identify thresholds and quantify negative associations between the distribution of diamondback terrapin and alterations to terrestrial–aquatic connectivity from land development, shoreline armouring, and fishing activity. Because diamondback terrapin responses are reflective of changes in coastal habitats, especially marshes, terrapin occurrence can be used to direct wetlands conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - After centuries of decline, oyster populations are now on the rise in coastal systems globally following aquaculture development and restoration efforts. Oysters regulate the biogeochemistry of coastal systems in part by promoting sediment nutrient recycling and removing excess nitrogen via denitrification. Less clear is how oysters alter sediment greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes-an important consideration as oyster populations grow. Here, we show that sediments in oyster habitats produce carbon dioxide (CO2), with highest rates in spring (2396.91 ± 381.98 μmol CO2 m-2 h-1) following deposition of seasonal diatom blooms and in summer (2795.20 ± 307.55 μmol CO2 m-2 h-1) when temperatures are high. Sediments in oyster habitats also consistently released methane to the water column (725.94 ± 150.34 nmol CH4 m-2 h-1) with no seasonal pattern. Generally, oyster habitat sediments were a sink for nitrous oxide (N2O; -36.11 ± 7.24 nmol N2O m-2 h-1), only occasionally releasing N2O in spring. N2O release corresponded to high organic matter and dissolved nitrogen availability, suggesting denitrification as the production pathway. Despite potential CO2 production increases under aquaculture in some locations, we conclude that in temperate regions oysters have an overall negligible impact on sediment GHG cycling.

AB  - Adaptive management has been adopted as the standard approach to inform the multi-billion-dollar post-Deepwater Horizon coastal restoration programs in the Gulf of Mexico. An adaptive management process can help restoration projects at multiple spatial scales—from local shorelines to entire ecosystems—by identifying critical uncertainties and guiding restoration actions away from trial and error and toward an evidence-based approach. Based on our experiences, we identify challenges that must be overcome in developing large-scale adaptive management in the Gulf of Mexico. We demonstrate how the likelihood of restoration success for eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica and other resources could increase through (1) better matching monitoring efforts and funding with on-the-ground restoration efforts and (2) coordinating similar research projects at multiple scales to share challenges, solutions, and knowledge by creating spatially and temporally replicated restoration projects to identify best restoration practices. We agree with recent U.S. National Academy of Science assessments that adaptive management offers the best framework to guide restoration in the Gulf of Mexico, but we challenge practitioners, policymakers, and managers to recognize the need for strong leadership to implement this framework as originally proposed (but rarely practiced), so that opportunities for learning are not lost.

AB  - Active restoration is becoming an increasingly important conservation intervention to counteract the degradation of marine coastal ecosystems. Understanding what has motivated the scientific community to research the restoration of marine coastal ecosystems and how restoration research projects are funded is essential if we want to scale-up restoration interventions to meaningful extents. Here, we systematically review and synthesize data to understand the motivations for research on the restoration of coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, saltmarsh, and oyster reefs. We base this analysis off a published database of marine restoration studies, originally designed to estimate the cost and feasibility of marine coastal restoration, derived from mostly scientific studies published in peer-reviewed and some gray literature. For the present study, the database was updated with fields aimed at assessing the motivations, outcomes, and funding sources for each project. We classify restoration motivations into five categories: biotic, experimental, idealistic, legislative, and pragmatic. Moreover, we evaluate the variables measured and outcomes reported by the researchers and evaluate whether projects adhered to the Society for Ecological Restoration's (SER) standards for the practice of ecological restoration. The most common motivation of the scientific community to study restoration in marine coastal ecosystems was experimental i.e., to seek experimental data to answer ecological research questions or improve restoration approach, as expected since mostly peer-reviewed literature was evaluated here. There were differences in motivations among the five coastal ecosystems. For instance, biodiversity enhancement was the most common case for a biotic motivation in mangrove restoration projects. The most common metrics evaluated were growth/productivity, survivorship, habitat function, physical attributes, and reproduction. For most ecosystems, ecological outcomes were frequently reported, with socio-economic implications of the restoration rarely mentioned, except for mangroves. Projects were largely funded by governmental grants with some investment from private donations, non-governmental organizations, and the involvement of volunteers. Our findings and database provide critical data to align future research of the scientific community with the real social, economic and policy needs required to scale-up marine coastal restoration projects.

AB  - Across the globe, discussions centered on the value of nature drive many conservation and restoration decisions. As a result, justification for management activities increasingly asks for two lines of evidence: (1) biological proof of augmented ecosystem function or service, and (2) monetary valuation of these services. For oyster reefs, which have seen significant global declines and increasing restoration work, the need to provide both biological and monetary evidence of reef services on a local-level has become more critical in a time of declining resources. Here, we quantified species biomass and potential commercial value of nekton collected from restored oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in coastal Louisiana over a 3-year period, providing multiple snapshots of biomass support over time. Overall, and with little change over time, fish and invertebrate biomass is 212% greater at restored oyster reefs than mud-bottom, or 0.12 kg m(-2). The additional biomass of commercial species is equivalent to an increase of local fisheries value by 226%, or $0.09 m(-2). Understanding the ecosystem value of restoration projects, and how they interact with regional management priorities, is critical to inform local decision-making and provide testable predictions. Quantitative estimates of potential commercial fisheries enhancement by oyster reef restoration such as this one can be used directly by local managers to determine the expected return on investment.

AB  - Accelerating the recovery of marine coastal ecosystems is a global challenge that has been attempted on many systems around the world. Restoration efforts have shown varying levels of success at localized-scales, but developing techniques for large-scale application are still in their nascent stage for many systems. For seagrass meadows and marsh plants, large-scale successes have been realized by distributing seeds from moving boats or planes, respectively. Similarly for coral reefs, the harvesting, culturing and releasing of wild coral-spawn slicks to targeted reefs is anticipated to achieve cost-efficient, large-scale restoration of coral communities with low-impact technology. Yet, operational protocols for full-scale application still require development by practitioners. In this study we conducted a field trial to evaluate the actual feasibility of harvesting wild coral-spawn slicks for large-scale restoration activities, incorporating technologies used in oil spill remediation, dredging operations, and land-based aquaculture. Testing the potential for scalability to commercial vessels, our trial focused on concentrating and collecting wild coral-spawn slicks for culturing until settlement competency using an experimental 50,000 L aquaculture facility built on a tugboat. Five objectives were set and all were achieved successfully, with only one requiring further optimization. Overall, this restoration approach allows for long-distance translocation of genetically diverse coral assemblages, and may be combined with other larval conditioning techniques that are being developed to increase the resistance to stress and survival of coral recruits. Most importantly, it is fully scalable to produce billions of coral larvae for delivery to target reefs, with negligible impact to source populations.

AB  - AbstractWooden fences are nature-based supporting structures to restore mangroves in the Mekong Delta. The hydraulic functioning of wooden fences was studied in previous studies. However, the role of bathymetry in the dissipation and damping of waves by wooden fences has not been studied yet. Thus, in this study, a numerical approach is used to find the effect of the position of fences and the foreshore bathymetry, including two particular slopes of 1/200 and 1/500, on wave damping due to wooden fences. The results show that the bottom slope significantly influences the dissipation of incoming waves, the so-called pre-dissipation, before damping by the wooden fences. Differences in pre-dissipation occur between fence locations along the cross-shore slopes. The higher pre-dissipation takes place for wooden fences closer to the land, as the depth-limited wave height at the fence reduces. The efficiency in wave damping of wooden fences is also increasing as the freeboard is becoming larger for the fence located closer landward.KeywordsWooden fencesNumerical modelSWASHBottom slopeFence locations

AB  - AbstractWetland managers have historically considered riprap-sill structures (a type of “living shoreline” consisting of a rock sill that is placed low in the intertidal zone, with native vegetation planted between the sill and the shore) to be more ecologically sound than the riprap that is traditionally applied for shoreline stabilization in estuaries. However, little research has been conducted to compare the macrofauna associated with riprap-sill and riprap-hardened shorelines. Density and diversity of fish and blue crabs Callinectes sapidus were compared via weekly sampling along a riprap-sill shoreline, a riprap shoreline, and a shoreline fringed with smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Delaware Coastal Bays during summer 2010. Seining was conducted to quantitatively sample the shore zone and shallow subtidal regions, and minnow traps were used to determine the presence or absence of fishes in the mid- to upper-intertidal zone of each shoreline type.

AB  - ABSTRACTWe assess the suitability of conventional replanting techniques of Rhizophora mucronata and the relationship with soil properties, and compare the differences between rehabilitation and non-rehabilitation sites, on Carey Island, Malaysia. The average survival rate of planted seedlings at the rehabilitation site was 46% in the first six months, gradually reducing to complete mortality after one year, while no survival was recorded at the non-rehabilitation site from the beginning. Over the short period, survival of the clumped planting technique yielded the highest survival rate (75%) compared with random (33%) and uniform (30%) techniques; with a height increment of 2.48 ± 1.87 cm/month, diameter increment of 0.49 ± 0.81 mm/month, leaf increment of 2.05 ± 2.80 and chlorophyll content of 32.08 ± 5.80 SPAD (= Soil Plant Analysis Development values). Fifteen new recruits of Avicennia spp. with a 60% survival rate were recorded in the rehabilitation site at the end of the study. Soil texture changed s...

AB  - AbstractThis study extended and unified resistance formulations for rigid and deformable plants under both emergent and submerged conditions. Three approaches were examined in detail and implemented into a numerical model. First, the flow resistance formulations for rigid plants were critically reviewed. By introducing plant deformation relations with a given vegetal stress and vegetation properties, the formulation for rigid plants was extended to flexural rigid plants. Second, a flow resistance formulation directly derived from submerged, flexible plants was examined and extended. Both approaches to simulating deformable vegetation solve a set of two equations, a vegetation deformation relation and a resistance law, iteratively. The methodology and numerical algorithm for rigid and deformable plants were implemented into an operational storm surge model and tested against laboratory data. Good agreement has been found. The verified model can be used to study the spatial and temporal variations of deflec...

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents a parametric study on storm-surge reduction by flexible vegetation in coastal wetlands under idealized prototype conditions. A vegetation-induced flow resistance model that considers flow depth, flow velocity, and vegetation properties has been developed and verified using laboratory data. The model computes the drag resulting from deformable vegetation under both emergent and submerged conditions. Numerical experiments were conducted to reveal the potential of wetlands in reducing storm surge, and to examine the role of the vegetation field in obstructing surge water. Although a constant Manning’s coefficient is used commonly in hydrodynamic models simulating storm surge over coastal wetlands, the current study reveals the extraordinary temporal variation in the Manning’s coefficient. The dynamic Manning’s coefficient felt by the flow is not only a function of vegetation properties, such as stiffness, diameter, vegetation height and population density, but also varies with the...

AB  - AbstractThe climate change impact highly threatens coastal regions. Coastal populations face a range of climate-related risks such as cyclones, sea-level rise, and coastal flooding. The built environment has a significant impact over the local climate and environment of coastal communities. Coastal areas are identified to be central locations of human habitats creating coastal urban centres further enhances the risk. Therefore, developing substantial climate adaptation strategies for the built environment in coastal regions is essential. In developing suitable adaptation measures, it is essential to understand the impacts of climate change on the coastal built environment in detail. This research is conducted as a part of a colloborative research project BEACON (Built Environment leArning for Climate adaptation), co-financed by the European Union Erasmus + programme. This study conducted a detailed review of the climate change impact on the built environment in coastal regions. A systematic literature review based on three academic databases Science Direct, Emerald Insight and Scopus, was conducted. The synthesised data were analysed using the thematic analysis technique, and the climate change impacts were mainly categorised as physical and non-physical impacts. The primary climate change evidence in coastal regions is sea level rise, weather conditions, and precipitation changes. The associated disaster risks and their physical and non-physical (economic, social, and environmental) impacts in the coastal regions have been summarised into a single framework. This could be used as a basis to develop tangible climate adaptation measures in the coastal built environment.KeywordsClimate change impactBuilt environmentCoastal regionDisaster risk

AB  - AbstractSea-level rise (SLR) estimates vary broadly, but most estimates predict significant increases in sea levels within the next century. Through the use of validated, coupled wave and hydrodynamic models, this study investigates SLR effects on storm surge and nearshore waves, including variation with coastal landscape type and storm characteristics. Both the wave and hydrodynamic models account for bottom friction based on land-use type, so the modeling procedure accounted for SLR-related changes to land cover, in addition to higher mean sea levels. Simulation of storms with similar meteorological characteristics and track but with landfall in the northeastern and southwestern coastal areas allowed examination of how the coastal features influenced the storm surge and wave response to increased sea levels. The simulation results analyzed here demonstrate that the relationship between storm surge and relative SLR (RSLR) varies between geographic region and storm scenario. The increase in an inundated a...

AB  - ABSTRACTGlobally, shoreline protection approaches are evolving towards the incorporation of natural and nature-based features (living shorelines henceforth) as a preferred alternative to shoreline armoring. Emerging research suggests that living shorelines may be a viable approach to conserving coastal habitats (marshes, beaches, shallows, seagrasses) along eroding shorelines. Living shorelines typically involve the use of coastal habitats, such as wetlands, that have a natural capacity to stabilize the shore, restore or conserve habitat, and maintain coastal processes. They provide stability while still being dynamic components of the ecosystem, but due to their dynamic nature, careful designs and some maintenance will be required if habitat conservation is a goal. Living shorelines may represent a singular opportunity for habitat conservation in urban and developing estuaries because of their value to society as a shoreline protection approach and resilience to sea level rise. However, enhanced public a...

AB  - ABSTRACTCoastal protection of communities and property using “green infrastructure” approaches is gaining popularity as the science and practice improve. Guidance is limited for decision makers interested in taking action to protect shorelines. Here, we offer practical guidance for decision makers interested in moving beyond generalities for coastal protection strategies. We present three case examples from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in Belize, each posing different questions, and thus using different approaches, to evaluate whether green infrastructure strategies could be useful. For basic questions about where habitat-based approaches are likely to add value, index-based models are useful in identifying priority areas for habitat protection or restoration. Process-based models are best used to examine strategies where the interest is in the likely magnitude of value from gray and green infrastructure approaches. Process-based models in coastal Texas demonstrate that marsh habitats are spatially variabl...

AB  - ABSTRACTAs Louisiana continues to experience substantial coastal wetland loss—at the rate of a football field every 45 min—and multiple disasters, state and federal officials struggle with implementing restoration plans in this highly productive ecosystem. The 2007 Louisiana Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast is the first large-scale restoration plan in the United States to incorporate hazard mitigation. However, there is no mandate for local governments to adhere to this plan. Building upon the planning quality and evaluation literature, this study analyzes comprehensive land use plans in Louisiana's coastal zone to systematically assess the quality of the plans within the context of a non-mandated, $50 billion large-scale state restoration plan. Results indicate a great disparity in plan quality; a majority of the local governments lack the capacity to implement the nonstructural programmatic elements of the state's plan.  The study concludes with a discussion and recommendations for prac...

Critics of coastal and ocean planning point to a complicated process with many actors, objectives, and uncertain outcomes. This paper explores one such decision-making process in Belize, which combines ecosystem service modeling, stakeholder participation, and spatial planning to design the country’s first integrated coastal zone management plan, officially approved by the government in August 2016. We assessed risk to three coastal-marine habitats posed by eight human uses and quantified current and future delivery of three ecosystem services: protection from storms, catch and revenue from lobster fishing, and tourism expenditures to identify a preferred zoning scheme. We found that a highly adaptive team of planners, scientists, and analysts can overcome common planning obstacles, including a dearth of data describing the health of...

AB  - Abstract. This study explores the uncertainty introduced in global assessments of coastal flood exposure and risk when not accounting for water-level attenuation due to land-surface characteristics. We implement a range of plausible water-level attenuation values for characteristic land-cover classes in the flood module of the Dynamic and Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) modelling framework and assess the sensitivity of flood exposure and flood risk indicators to differences in attenuation rates. Results show a reduction of up to 44 % in area exposure and even larger reductions in population exposure and expected flood damages when considering water-level attenuation. The reductions vary by country, reflecting the differences in the physical characteristics of the floodplain as well as in the spatial distribution of people and assets in coastal regions. We find that uncertainties related to not accounting for water attenuation in global assessments of flood risk are of similar magnitude to the uncertainties related to the amount of sea-level rise expected over the 21st century. Despite using simplified assumptions to account for the process of water-level attenuation, which depends on numerous factors and their complex interactions, our results strongly suggest that an improved understanding and representation of the temporal and spatial variation of water levels across floodplains is essential for future impact modelling.

AB  - Abstract. The increasing vulnerability of coastal mega-cities to storm surge inundation means both infrastructure and populations are subject to significant threat. Planning for further urban development should include consideration of the changing circumstances in coastal cities to ensure a sustainable future. A sustainable urban plan relies on well preparedness and prediction of future climate change and multiple natural hazards. In light of these needs for urban planning, this paper develops a general method to simulate typhoon generated storm surge at the meso-scale (1–100 km in length). Meso-scale simulation provides a general approach that could be implemented to fulfil the purpose of planning, and has relatively low requirements for computation time and data, while still providing reasonable accuracy. The case study of Shanghai was chosen to implement this method. The meso-scale simulated results of two historical typhoons not only provides a realistic result at the city level, but is also suitable for implementing a large amount of simulations for future scenario studies. The method is generally applicable to all coastal cities around the world to examine the effect of future climate change on typhoon generated storm surge, even where historical observed data are inadequate or not available.

Biodiversitas 20: 2119-2127. Air Telang Protected Forest (ATPF) is one of the protected forests in the coastal area of South Sumatra, Indonesia which is around 12,660.9 hectares. This area is strategic because it borders directly with the Bangka Strait and adjacent to Sembilang National Park making it easy to access by the community. Various anthropogenic activities in the region such as residential, farming, agriculture, aquaculture, port and timber harvesting have led to degradation and loss of primary mangrove forest. This study aims to analyze the species composition and community structure of mangrove vegetation in the ATPF. The data were collected through observations at several point-centered samplings which were used to analyze the species composition and community structure of the vegetation and the physicochemical conditions of the environment. The species composition of this area consists of 20 species belonging to 14 families. The dominant species of tree, sapling and seedling stages are Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata and Acrostichum aureum, respectively. Overall species diversity index in this region is classified as very low, ranging from 0.00 to 0.73. Cluster analysis showed three types of vegetation structures in this region, namely Cyperus-Acrostichum type (shrub vegetation), Acrostichum-Rhizophora type (secondary forests) and Nypa-Avicennia (primary forests).

AB  - Abstract. Coastal lowlands and estuaries are subjected to increasing flood risks during storm surges due to global and regional changes. Tidal wetlands are increasingly valued as effective natural buffers for storm surges by dissipating wave energy and providing flood water storage. While previous studies focused on flood wave attenuation within and behind wetlands, this study focuses on the effects of estuarine wetland properties on the attenuation of a storm tide that propagates along the length of an estuary. Wetland properties including elevation, surface area, and location within the estuary were investigated using a numerical model of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, SW Netherlands). For a spring tide lower wetland elevations result in more attenuation of high water levels along the estuary, while for a higher storm tide higher elevations provide more attenuation compared to lower wetland elevations. For spring and storm tide a larger wetland surface area results in a better attenuation along the estuary up to a threshold wetland size for which larger wetlands do not further contribute to more attenuation. Finally a wetland of the same size and elevation, but located more upstream in the estuary, can store a larger proportion of the local flood volume and therefore has a larger attenuating effect on upstream high water levels. With this paper we aim to contribute towards a better understanding and wider implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation to increasing estuarine flood risks associated with storms.

AB  - Abstract. Coastal flood hazard and exposure are expected to increase over the course of the 21st century, leading to increased coastal flood risk. In order to limit the increase in future risk, or even reduce coastal flood risk, adaptation is necessary. Here, we present a framework to evaluate the future benefits and costs of structural protection measures at the global scale, which accounts for the influence of different flood risk drivers (namely sea-level rise, subsidence, and socioeconomic change). Globally, we find that the estimated expected annual damage (EAD) increases by a factor of 150 between 2010 and 2080 if we assume that no adaptation takes place. We find that 15 countries account for approximately 90 % of this increase. We then explore four different adaptation objectives and find that they all show high potential in cost-effectively reducing (future) coastal flood risk at the global scale. Attributing the total costs for optimal protection standards, we find that sea-level rise contributes the most to the total costs of adaptation. However, the other drivers also play an important role. The results of this study can be used to highlight potential savings through adaptation at the global scale.

AB  - Abstract. Authors. 2020. Effects of permeable barriers on total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangrove forests and abandoned ponds in Demak District, Central Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 5298-5307. In this study, we observed the effects of constructing permeable barriers in the low-lying coastal zone and severely eroded coast of Demak District, Central Java, Indonesia in the context of mangrove forest structures and carbon (C) dynamics. Forest structures were characterized by stand density, basal area, and ecological indices. The dynamics of C, expressed as total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS), were compared in mangrove forests, abandoned ponds, and productive ponds by estimating C pools from above- and belowground biomass, dead organic matter, and soil. We found that permeable barriers, whether or not protect mangroves, results in the similarity of above- and belowground C due to no considerable difference in basal area. By contrast, soil properties in terms of bulk density, N concentration, and C:N ratio statistically varied among sites. We discovered that changes in soil properties were associated with duration of permeable barriers, resulting in an increase of soil C in mangrove sites, i.e., 618.84±30.39 Mg C ha?1; 704.13±17.73 Mg C ha?1; and 759.88±15.26 Mg C ha?1 in 0-, 1-, and 4-year-old permeable barriers, respectively. Moreover, these barriers were proved not only could enrich soil C in mangroves but also provide a habitat for Avicennia sp. seedlings in the newly reclaimed coastline.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Natural ecosystems in estuaries are modified by the effects of runoff from disturbed watersheds and are frequently replaced by armoured estuarine shorelines. Whilst the effects of these 2 stressors are widely recognised, they are typically studied in isolation, and it is not clear how these contrasting types of urbanisation interact to shape faunal assemblages. In this study, fish assemblages were surveyed with underwater videos arranged in a 200 m grid throughout the lower reaches of 3 estuaries in eastern Australia (resulting in ≥63 sites per estuary and 277 sites in total) which differed in their extent of shoreline and watershed urbanisation. Overall, the least urbanised estuary supported more than twice the number of fish species and a significantly greater abundance of fish. The spatial patterns of fish diversity and abundance within estuaries were related to the proximity of urbanised shorelines, with most fish groups aggregating near armoured shorelines. These effects of distance from urbanised shorelines were, however, modified by the degree to which the entire estuary had been modified. We show that the ecological effects of urbanisation can extend across estuaries and suggest that coastal landscapes should therefore be managed as interlinked mosaics of both natural and artificial habitats

Consequently, urbanization (anthropogenic development) of the watershed has occurred, resulting in shoreline hardening and habitat destruction. A resulting gradient of urbanization increases from the southern to the northern portion of the bay's watershed. The objective of this study was to investigate cumulative impacts of urbanization in Barnegat Bay by assessing species composition, abundance, and diversity of fish communities in relation to the large-scale urbanization gradient in the watershed. Otter trawl surveys occurred in April, June, August, and October for 3 years (2012–2014) at 40 sampling sites stratified along the urbanization gradien...

AB  - ABSTRACT The ubiquitous loss of natural intertidal oyster reefs and associated ecosystem services has fueled restoration efforts throughout the world. Effective restoration requires an understanding of the distribution, density, and demographic rates (growth and survival) of oysters inhabiting existing natural reefs and how these may vary as a function of landscape-scale factors, such as tidal range and fetch distances. Furthermore, natural intertidal habitats are increasingly being replaced with hardened shoreline structures that may be colonized by oysters, yet little is known about habitat quality (as indexed by oyster density and demographic rates) of these hardened structures relative to natural habitats. The present study sought to compare oyster density, demographic rates, and population estimates (1) across estuarine landscape settings to inform natural intertidal oyster reef restoration (i.e., comparing natural intertidal reefs within adjacent water bodies that vary in tidal regimes and fetch dis...

AB  - ABSTRACT The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a reef-forming organism commonly found in estuaries throughout the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. Eastern oyster reefs provide several ecosystem services, including water filtration, habitat diversity, and storm surge protection, among others. Oyster abundance has declined precipitously during the past century along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as a result of overfishing, disease and predation, and large-scale human-mediated events. Given the importance of oysters, both ecologically and economically, there have been significant efforts during the past 20 y to reestablish and/or restore oysters to historical levels. Successful reef restoration depends on choosing sites that optimize survival, which requires an understanding of the environmental factors that influence the life stage of an oyster. For most restoration projects, time and budget constraints prevent long-term field studies; therefore, modeling is often used to determine the best...

AB  - ABSTRACT Successful and sustainable oyster reef restoration relies on suitable substrate material that is both readily available and encourages long-term recruitment and growth of oysters. China is increasing oyster reef restoration, however, little information is available to guide sustainable practices under local conditions and on ecologically relevant time scales. This study examines the effects of four substrate materials (oyster shell, clam shell, limestone, and clay brick) on community demographics for the Kumamoto oyster (Crassostrea sikamea) and associated macrofauna over a 3-y period in Xiangshan Bay, China. During the first 2 y, oyster and clam shell had similarly high recruitment and abundance of live oysters when compared with limestone and clay bricks. All substrate types, however, ended up with similar oyster abundances and size distributions after 3 y. Similar trends existed with regard to structural complexity (weight and volume) of substrate and any differences at the onset of the experi...

AB  - ABSTRACT Subtidal oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs constructed during in the mid 1990s in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, initially supported high densities of oysters; however, beginning around 2007, oyster density subsequently declined. Concurrent with the decline in oyster density was an increase in the prevalence of boring sponges (Cliona) on oysters and the underlying reef substrate material at these sites. The limestone marl substrate used to build these reefs became colonized by boring sponge to the degree that bioerosion by sponge potentially compromised the suitability of the reefs for oysters. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine whether oyster demographic rates of settlement, recruitment, growth, and mortality were affected by the presence of Cliona on underlying shell substrate. Oyster settlement on shells with varying levels of sponge was measured in the laboratory, and oyster recruitment, growth, and mortality in the presence and absence of sponge were measured in ...

In concept, ecological restoration will improve ecosystem characteristics of degraded habitats, but in practice, restoration success assessments typically target vegetation communities. We sought to determine if estuarine emergent marsh restoration projects (Galveston Bay, Texas) that had successfully achieved permit-mandated plant coverage were comparable to reference sites at an ecosystem level. We used a Rapid Assessment Method developed specifically for this habitat (Galv-RAM) to compare restored (ages 5–15 y) and reference marshes. Thirteen biotic and abiotic characteristics were used to calculate an ecosystem index score, whereby a pristine habitat would score 100%. The average Galv-RAM ecosystem index score for reference marshes (81%) was typical for urbanized estuaries. Restored marshes scored 75%, indicating that they were relatively well developed, although there was s...

AB  - ABSTRACT Stable isotope composition of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica was characterized from three estuaries in the Ten Thousand Islands (Florida). Freshwater in flow from watershed management is affecting this region and has deeply modified the salinity gradient. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to trace specific sources of organic matter and the influence of these sources of carbon on the diet of the eastern oyster in the Greater Everglades. Oysters, as well as particulate organic matter (POM) and benthicmicroalgae (BMA) were sampled in three bays at three different stations from upstream to downstream during both wet and dry seasons. Significant salinity differences were observed in all estuaries between summer (wet) and winter (dry) seasons and were linked to freshwater inputs into the bays. Temperature followed a typical seasonal trend. Oysters were enriched in δ15N compared with POM and BMA, and similarly or slightly enriched in δ13C for both seasons. Lighter δ13C values in th...

AB  - ABSTRACT Salt marsh loss is projected to increase as sea-level rise accelerates with global climate change. Salt marsh loss occurs along both lateral creek and channel edges and in the marsh interior, when pannes expand and coalesce. Often, edge loss is attributed to erosive processes whereas dieback in the marsh interior is linked to excessive inundation or deposition of wrack. We conducted a two-year field experiment (2016-2018) in a central California estuary, where, immediately preceding our study, marsh dieback at creek edges and panne expansion occurred during a period of severe drought and an overlapping warm water event. Our study explored how an abundant burrowing crab, shown to have strong negative effects on marsh biomass near creek edges, affects panne dynamics. We also explored which panne attributes best predicted their dynamics. Overall, we found that pannes contracted during the study period, but with variable rates of marsh recovery across pannes. Our model incorporating both physical and biological factors explained 86% of the variation in panne contraction. The model revealed a positive effect of crab activity, sediment accretion, and a composite of depth and elevation on panne contraction, and a negative effect of panne size and distance to nearest panne. The positive crab effects detected in pannes contrast with negative effects we had earlier detected near creek edges, highlighting the context-dependence of top-down and bioturbation effects in marshes. As global change continues and the magnitude and frequency of disturbances increases, understanding the dynamics of marsh loss in the marsh interior as well as creek banks will be critical for the management of these coastal habitats.

AB  - ABSTRACT Reefs and beds formed by oysters such as the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica and the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter 1864† were dominant features in many estuaries throughout their native ranges. Many of these estuaries no longer have healthy, productive reefs because of impacts from destructive fishing, sediment accumulation, pollution, and parasites. Once valued primarily as a fishery resource, increasing attention is being focused today on the array of other ecosystem services that oysters and the reefs they form provide in United States coastal bays and estuaries. Since the early 1990s efforts to restore subtidal and intertidal oyster reefs have increased significantly, with particular interest in small-scale community-based projects initiated most often by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To date, such projects have been undertaken in at least 15 US states, for both species of dominant native oysters along the United States coast. Community-based restoration practitioners ...

AB  - Abstract Purpose Climate change is a global threat to social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In an increasingly urbanized world, homeowners play an important role in climate adaptation and environmental sustainability through decisions to landscape and manage their residential properties. Methodology/approach In this chapter, we review the potential impacts of climate change on environmental sustainability in urban ecosystems and highlight the role of urban and suburban residents in conserving biodiversity. We focus extensively on the interactions of homeowners and residential landscapes in urban coastal and desert environments. Practical implications Understanding how human-environment interactions are linked with a changing climate is especially relevant for coastal and desert cities in the United States, which are already experiencing visible impacts of climate change. In fact, many homeowners are already making decisions in response to environmental change, and these decisions will ultimately shape the future structure, function and sustainability of these critically important ecosystems. Social implications Considering the close relationship between biodiversity and the health and well-being of human societies, understanding how climate change and other social motivations affect the landscaping decisions of urban residents will be critical for predicting and enhancing sustainability in these social-ecological systems.

AB  - ABSTRACT Oysters provide habitat, sediment stabilization, and improved water quality, and are important foundation species in many estuarine ecosystems. Worldwide oyster population declines have been dramatic and efforts to restore declining populations and the services they provide are ongoing. Several commonly used oyster restoration techniques were examined to determine which would be the most successful for restoring the Olympia oyster Ostrea lurida in Newport Bay, CA. Replicate (n = 5) 2×2 m shell beds were constructed of two initial shell planting thicknesses (bed thicknesses of 4 versus 12 cm) and two methods of deployment (bagged versus loose shell). Shell cover, oyster spatfall (settlement), oyster recruitment, and adult oyster densities were analyzed over 2 y; 12-cm-thick oyster beds maintained higher shell cover, experienced less sedimentation, and received greater numbers of oyster recruits than 4-cm-thick beds. There was no significant effect of shell deployment method on shell cover, recruit...

AB  - ABSTRACT Oysters and the reefs they build are being recognized and restored increasingly for the broad suite of ecosystem services they can provide. However, surprisingly little effort has been devoted to documenting the outcomes of such restoration or creation projects through time, or to comparing projects from different regions. In this study, we examined the oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) and benthic macrofaunal development on a created intertidal oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) reef along a salinity and exposure (vertical position on reef) gradient 5 y after creation in the Yangtze River estuary, China. Three years after reef creation, sustainable oyster populations were established successfully and market-size oysters accounted for more than 24% of the total reef cover, with mean abundances ranging from 95–225 adult oysters/m2. Associated community metrics (species richness, abundance. and biomass) of benthic macrofauna showed generally increasing trends with reef development during the 5-y period;...

AB  - ABSTRACT Offshore oyster reefs in the Big Bend Coast of Florida have declined by 88% during the last 30 y, with the most likely mechanism being repeated die-offs due to predation and disease during high-salinity periods, driven by episodic and increasing periods of reduced freshwater input to estuaries. These die-off events have led to a conversion from shell to sandbar substrate and rapid loss of elevation (ca 8 cm/y). This process appears to be nonreversible, because oyster spat are unable to colonize sandy substrate. It is hypothesized that the addition of durable hard substrate would make reefs more resilient to periodic declines in freshwater flow by providing a persistent settlement site for extant larvae. This article reports a test of the assumption that oyster populations on these reefs are limited by substrate, and documents key effects on oysters, elevation, and avian usage associated with the addition of substrate. Durable substrate was added in the form of limerock cobbles and recycled clam M...

The Block Island Bluff Image Project: Using Google Earth™, Spreadsheet Mapper, and Google Drive™ to build a database of spatially located field images of coastal bluffs. Spatially located field photography provides a mechanism to gather and share images for the purposes of creating virtual fieldtrips, examining change, and conducting outreach. Uploading images to Google Earth™ or other commercial sites is a common way of sharing images; however, these images are not accessible in a central, organized location, and the spatial control is limited. This paper presents a method of providing quick access to spatially located images using standard equipment (i.e. camera and GPS) and then linking these images to Google Earth using Spreadsheet Mapper, a free tool developed by Google.

AB  - A three-dimensional stratigraphic model was constructed of the upper 50 m of the Mississippi River Delta, southeastern USA. The model is used to understand hydrogeological connections among the Mississippi River, adjacent interdistributary bays and groundwater systems, and to understand how stratigraphic settings affect potential anthropically induced subsidence and erosion in the region. This study uses 619 geotechnical borings throughout the area along with the multiple-indicator natural neighbor (MINN) interpolation method to construct the model. Based on available data, the study focused on the Mississippi River reach from Head of Passes (river mouth) to Jesuit Bend (108 km upstream), covering an area of approximately 1,800 km2 and ranging in elevation from 3 to −46 m. The model shows typical basal coarse-grained sand bodies overlain by 10-m-thick blanket clay, which is interbedded frequently with silty and sandy sediments and occasionally with peat and organic clay. Sands are most abundant between elevations −10 and −35 m. The Mississippi River main channel incises the underlying sands, thereby providing pathways for river–groundwater exchange. Increased hydrologic loads may propagate along the flow paths potentially giving rise to high pore-water pressure and a resultant increase in land subsidence and thus local erosion of natural and local flood-control levees. This method of analysis may apply to other deltaic regions similarly subject to anthropically accelerated subsidence and erosion.

AB  - A source–pathway-receptor method is used to assess the risk of the coastal community of Charlestown, RI, USA, to the 100-year storm, including effects of sea level rise (SLR) and shoreline/dune erosion. The 100-year storm is simulated using a chain of stochastic and physics-based models combined with a scenario-based approach. Storm surge and wave spectral parameters, obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS), are used as boundary conditions for high-resolution wave simulations, performed in the coastal and inundation zones using the steady-state spectral wave model STWAVE. Selected scenarios are defined to assess the magnitude of the variability in predicted damage resulting from the uncertainty in SLR, erosion rate, and time at which the 100-year storm would occur. Erosion rates are based on empirical analyses of historic rates of shoreline change, SLR measurements, and coastal erosion theory. The risk is measured in terms of damage to individual houses, based on damage curves developed in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NACCS study. In addition, remediation scenarios are explored, demonstrating that a combination of dune replenishment and an increase in the residential resilience by elevating structures can significantly diminish the risk to the coastal community.

AB  - A risk assessment methodology has been developed and implemented to quantify eustatic sea level rise (SLR) and coastal storm impacts on losses to military installation assets and mission capabilities in Lower Chesapeake Bay. The approach is a multi-criteria risk assessment founded on the framework used for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) Project and the Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program (USACE 2008). A set of four SLR scenarios are being analyzed and include 0.5 to 2.0 meters in 0.5-meter increments over equal time durations of 100 years. Simulations start with the base year of 2000 and end in year 2100. Results are used as inputs to military installation asset and mission capability loss relationships. The entire risk assessment is composed of hydrodynamic storm surge and wave modeling in conjunction with sediment transport, geomorphologic, and environmental characterization analyses. This paper focuses on the regional hydrodynamic storm surge and wave modeling methodology and analysis. INTRODUCTION In 2009, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) funded four pilot studies to address a variety of risk-based issues surrounding the topic of sea level rise and its potential impacts on military installations in the nearand longterm (http://www.serdp.org/Program-Areas/Resource-Conservation-and-ClimateChange). The RC-1701 Project, entitled, Risk Quantification for Sustaining Coastal Military Installation Assets and Mission Capabilities was funded to examine potential effects of sea-level rise over the course of the next 100 years (2000 – 2100), and demonstrate the use of the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center’s

AB  - A novel hybrid (e.g., vegetation, sand, cobble, rip-rap) nature-based dune structure was constructed at Cardiff State Beach in Encinitas, California, to protect a critical transportation artery from undermining and frequent flooding. A collaboration between regulators, funders, state agencies, professional practice and academia developed a high resolution robust unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based monitoring strategy to observe dune construction and evolution. Fifteen construction surveys were conducted to observe each substrate element for future morphodynamic modeling efforts. Six post-construction surveys were conducted to observe seasonal and storm-by-storm dune evolution. Backshore vulnerability was assessed using a sixty-one year time series of tides and hindcast wave forcing fit to a general extreme value distribution. The dune crest is above calculated 100-year water levels; however, the dune remains vulnerable to mass wasting caused by swash interaction at the toe of the dune. Sea-level rise will substantially increase the probability of dune erosion, breaching, and overtopping.

AB  - A mixing model derived from first principles describes the bulk density (BD) of intertidal wetland sediments as a function of loss on ignition (LOI). The model assumes that the bulk volume of sediment equates to the sum of self-packing volumes of organic and mineral components or BD = 1/[LOI/k1 + (1-LOI)/k2], where k1 and k2 are the self-packing densities of the pure organic and inorganic components, respectively. The model explained 78% of the variability in total BD when fitted to 5075 measurements drawn from 33 wetlands distributed around the conterminous United States. The values of k1 and k2 were estimated to be 0.085 ± 0.0007 g cm-3 and 1.99 ± 0.028 g cm-3, respectively. Based on the fitted organic density (k1) and constrained by primary production, the model suggests that the maximum steady state accretion arising from the sequestration of refractory organic matter is ≤ 0.3 cm yr-1. Thus, tidal peatlands are unlikely to indefinitely survive a higher rate of sea-level rise in the absence of a significant source of mineral sediment. Application of k2 to a mineral sediment load typical of East and eastern Gulf Coast estuaries gives a vertical accretion rate from inorganic sediment of 0.2 cm yr-1. Total steady state accretion is the sum of the parts and therefore should not be greater than 0.5 cm yr-1 under the assumptions of the model. Accretion rates could deviate from this value depending on variation in plant productivity, root:shoot ratio, suspended sediment concentration, sediment-capture efficiency, and episodic events.

AB  - A growing suite of research has demonstrated that nature-based shoreline stabilization methods can increase resilience of coastal ecosystems by improving their capacity to return to predisturbance states. Previous work suggests that during hurricanes, living shorelines promote vertical accretion and experience less damage than traditional shoreline stabilization alternatives. Nevertheless, there is limited research looking at the impacts of major storm events on living shorelines and most studies have investigated a small number of sites. This study used in situ real-time kinematic (RTK)-GPS surveys to quantify the resilience (via the lateral change in shore position) of 17 living shoreline sites before and after a Category 1 hurricane event (Hurricane Florence, 2018). By doing so, this study seeks to understand the capacity of living shorelines (marsh with seaward breakwater or sill) to provide storm protection as compared to unaltered natural fringing salt marshes. After Hurricane Florence, living shorelines on average experienced significantly less lateral erosion compared to unprotected control segments (shoreline change rates of 0.015 and -0.31 m year-1 , respectively). This study also explores how environmental siting variables (i.e., scarp presence, fetch, and bottom sediment) and sill design variables (i.e., sill material, width, and height) influence short- and long-term erosion. living shorelines were found to reduce erosion of fringing marsh edge among projects with a range of installation ages, structural materials, sill widths, and sill heights, and they were able to provide protection from erosion across a range of fetch, scarp, and bottom sediment conditions. Living shoreline siting and sill design may be suitable for broader environmental conditions than previously known. This study shows that living shorelines can increase resilience by reducing erosion of fringing salt marshes, promoting lateral building up of shoreline zones during short-term disturbance events, and from their long-term presence.

AB  - A full-scale controlled experiment was conducted on an excavated and re-assembled coastal wetland surface, typicalof floristically diverse northwest European saltmarsh. The experiment was undertaken with true-to-scale water depths and waves in alarge wave flume, in order to assess the impact of storm surge conditions on marsh surface soils, initially with three different plantspecies and then when this marsh canopy had been mowed. The data presented suggests a high bio-geomorphological resilienceof salt marshes to vertical sediment removal, with less than 0.6 cm average vertical lowering in response to a sequence of simulatedstorm surge conditions. Both organic matter content and plant species exerted an important influence on both the variability anddegree of soil surface stability, with surfaces covered by a flattened canopy of the salt marsh grass Puccinellia experiencing a lowerand less variable elevation loss than those characterized by Elymus or Atriplex that exhibited considerable physical damage throughstem folding and breakage.

AB  - A 2-year period with flood versus drought conditions provided the opportunity to examine the effects of flood disturbance on subtidal eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica biology and population dynamics in a south Texas estuary. Oysters were sampled monthly in 2007 and 2008 to examine the impacts of changing environmental conditions on oyster populations. Oysters were also examined quarterly for the presence of Perkinsus marinus. Filtration rates were calculated as a function of oyster size, temperature, salinity, and total suspended solids. Flood events in 2007 caused temporary reductions in salinity and were associated with reductions in oyster abundance, spat settlement, disease levels (weighted prevalence and percent infection), and filtration rates. Oyster populations had generally recovered within 1 year’s time—the oysters were younger and smaller but were just as abundant as pre-flood levels. The rapid return of oysters to pre-flood abundance levels is attributed in part to the ability of oysters in Gulf coast estuaries to spawn multiple times in a single season and in part to their relatively high growth rates. Although flood disturbance may temporarily reduce or destroy oyster populations, the ability of the Mission–Aransas Estuary to retain freshwater pulses within the system and maintain low salinities that are unfavorable for predators and disease can facilitate oyster population recovery. Episodic flood events appear to play a critical role in promoting long-term oyster population maintenance in the Mission–Aransas Estuary. The response of oysters to changing environmental conditions over the short term provides some insights into the potential long-term effects of changing climate.

AB  - 1. Coral reefs underpin a range of ecosystem goods and services that contribute to the well-being of millions of people. However, tropical coral reefs in the Anthropocene are likely to be functionally different from reefs in the past. In this perspective piece, we ask, what does the Anthropocene mean for the provision of ecosystem services from coral reefs? 2. First, we provide examples of the provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services underpinned by coral reef ecosystems. We conclude that coral reef ecosystem service research has lagged behind multidisciplinary advances in broader ecosystem services science, such as an explicit recognition that interactions between social and ecological systems underpin ecosystem services. 3. Second, drawing on tools from functional ecology, we outline how these social–ecological relationships can be incorporated into a mechanistic understanding of service provision and how this might be used to anticipate future changes in coral reef ecosystem services. 4. Finally, we explore the emergence of novel reef ecosystem services, for example from tropicalized coastlines, or through changing technological connections to coral reefs. Indeed, when services are conceived as coming from social–ecological system dynamics, novelty in services can emerge from elements of the interactions between people and the ecosystem. 5. This synthesis of the coral reef ecosystem services literature suggests the field is poorly prepared to understand the changing service provision anticipated in the Anthropocene. A new research agenda is needed that better connects reef functional ecology to ecosystem service provision. This research agenda should embrace more holistic approaches to ecosystem service research, recognizing them as co-produced by ecosystems and society. Importantly, the likelihood of novel ecosystem service configurations requires further conceptualization and empirical assessment. As with current ecosystem services, the loss or gain of services will not affect all people equally and must be understood in the context in which they occur. With the uncertainty surrounding the future of coral reefs in the Anthropocene, research exploring how the benefits to people change will be of great importance.

AB  - 1. Bivalve habitat restoration is growing in geographic extent and scale globally. While addressing the wide-scale loss of these biogenic habitats is still a key motivation behind restoration efforts, stakeholders and funders are increasingly drawn to shellfish restoration for the many ecosystem services these habitats provide. 2. There is clear evidence for the provision of ecosystem services from species targeted for restoration in the USA, in particular Crassostrea virginica. Ecosystem services, however, remain largely unquantified or even undescribed for the majority of other species targeted for restoration. 3. A structured review of the literature was undertaken and supplemented by expert knowledge to identify which ecosystem services are documented in the following other bivalve species targeted for restoration: Ostrea edulis, Ostrea angasi, Crassostrea rhizophorae, Perna canaliculus, Modiolus modiolus, Mytilus edulis, Mytilus platensis, Crassostrea gigas, Ostrea denselamellosa, Crassostrea ariakensis, and Crassostrea sikamea. 4. Key knowledge gaps in quantifying ecosystem services and the ecosystem engineering properties of habitat-building bivalves contributing to the provision of ecosystem services were identified. Ecosystem services with the potential to be widely applicable across bivalve habitat-building species were identified. 5. Though there is evidence that many of the ecosystem engineering properties that underpin the provision of ecosystem services are universal, the degree to which services are provided will vary between locations and species. Species-specific, in situ, studies are needed in order to avoid the inappropriate transfer of the ecosystem service delivery between locations, and to further build support and understanding for these emerging targets of restoration.

AB  - 1.	Coastal ecosystem engineers often depend on self‐facilitating feedbacks to ameliorate environmental stress. This makes the restoration of such coastal ecosystem engineers difficult. We question if we can increase transplantation success in highly dynamic coastal areas by engineering measures that promote the development of self‐facilitating feedback processes.2.	Intertidal blue mussels Mytilus edulis are a typical example of ecosystem engineers that are difficult to restore. A lack of self‐facilitating feedbacks at low densities limits establishment success when young mussels are transplanted on dynamic mudflats.3.	In a large field experiment, we investigated the possibility of increasing transplantation success by stimulating the formation of an aggregated spatial configuration in mussels, thereby reducing hydrologically induced dislodgment and the risks of predation. For this, we applied engineering measures in the form of fences that trapped wave dislodged mussels.4.	Mussel loss rates were significantly lower when mussels were placed between both artificial fences, and in high densities (4.2 kg/m2) compared with mussels placed in areas without fences and in low densities (2.1 kg/m2). The fences induced the formation of a banded pattern with high local mussel densities, which locally reduced predation.5.	Synthesis and applications. Our results underline the importance of actively promoting the development of self‐facilitating processes, such as aggregation into patterns, in restoration projects of ecosystem engineers. In particular, the current study shows that engineering measures can help to initiate these kinds of self‐facilitating interactions, especially in highly dynamic areas.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Under the umbrella term of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) fall measures from a wide range of disciplines. With regard to coastal protection, coastal ecosystems represent possible and promising NbS to coastal threats such as storm surges or erosion. Around the globe, the looming climate change and related developments in the coastal landscapes as well as a paradigm shift in societal views shifted the focus of decision-makers and researchers onto NbS for coastal protection, driving the need for a comprehensive up-to-date review of coastal ecosystems like salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass meadows, beaches, dunes, coral, and shellfish/oyster reefs and their benefits for Water, Nature and People alike. While existing reviews of NbS have mainly focused on the idea of softer coastal protection in general and constraints regarding management and regulations, this study reviews not only the characteristics, features and needs of the coastal ecosystems under consideration but also examines the ecosystems’ potential and related processes for coastal protection, their ecological as well as their societal benefits. This review paper is based on an extensive literature review and analysis of scientific publications, books and book sections, guidelines, reports, policy recommendations and strategies. In order to create a basis for the selection of site-suitable adaptation measures for local coastal challenges and questions, this study compiles the coastal ecosystems’ key features and elaborates the provided ecosystem services for protective, ecological and societal needs. The highlighted diversity of processes within ecosystems that directly cause or support coastal protection, in combination with the multiple ecological services and societal benefits, underlines the great potential of coastal ecosystems to bridge the gap between coastal engineering and nature conservation. In combination with existing coastal protection, coastal ecosystems as NbS can serve both disciplines equally and provide an integral, sustainable element in the adaptation of coastal protection to climate change.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The North Atlantic Basin (NAB) is seeing a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones since the 1980s, with record-breaking seasons such as 2017 and 2020. However, little is known about how coastal ecosystems, particularly mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, are responding to these new “climate normals” at regional and subregional scales. Wind speed, rainfall, pre-cyclone forest structure, and hydro-geomorphology are known to influence mangrove damage and recovery following cyclones in the NAB. However, these studies have focused on site-specific responses and individual cyclonic events. Here, we analyze 25 years (1996-2020) of mangrove vulnerability (damage after a cyclone) and short-term resilience (recovery after damage) for the entire NAB and its subregions, using multi-annual, remote sensing-derived databases. We applied machine learning to characterize the influence of 22 potential drivers that include previously researched variables and new ones such as human development and long-term climate trends. The characteristics of the cyclones mainly drive vulnerability at the regional level, while resilience is largely driven by site-specific conditions. These include long-term climate conditions, such as air temperature and drought trends, pre-cyclone habitat conditions, such as canopy cover and height and soil organic carbon stock, and human interventions on the land. Rates and drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience vary across subregions in the NAB, and hotspots for restoration and conservation actions are highlighted within subregions. The impacts of increasing cyclone activity need to be framed in the context of climate change compound effects and heavy human influences in the region. There is an urgent need to value the restoration and conservation of mangroves as fundamental Nature-based Solutions against cyclone impacts in the NAB.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The global loss of marine ecosystem engineers has caused an unprecedented decline in biodiversity. Although wild shellfish habitats have been shown to support biodiverse ecosystems, little is known about how biodiversity is altered by restored shellfish habitats, particularly mussels. To explore the biodiversity response to restored mussel habitats we deposited mussels on the seafloor in 1.5 × 1.5 m plots across a gradient of benthic environments. To understand a holistic community response, this study looks at the response of three faunal classifications over 1 year: infauna, epifauna, and pelagic fauna, compared with adjacent control plots (no mussels). The restored mussel habitats recorded 42 times more demersal fish than control areas, while macroalgae and mobile benthic invertebrates had over a twofold increase in abundance. Overall, the addition of mussels to the seafloor resulted in a general reduction of infaunal abundance and biodiversity, but an increase in epifaunal and pelagic faunal abundances, specifically from those species that benefit from benthic habitat complexity and an increase in food availability. From a management perspective, we highlight location-specific differences to consider for future restoration efforts, including environmental conditions and potential observed factors such as nearby sources of species, particularly predators, and relevant demersal fish ranges. Ultimately, measuring biodiversity responses in small-scale studies will serve as a valuable guide for larger scale restoration efforts and this study recommends considerations to enhance biodiversity outcomes in restored mussel habitats.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Sea-level rise (SLR) and obstructions to sediment delivery pose challenges to the persistence of estuarine habitats and the ecosystem services they provide. Restoration actions and sediment management strategies may help mitigate such challenges by encouraging the vertical accretion of sediment in and horizontal migration of tidal forests and marshes. We used a process-based soil accretion model (Coastal Wetland Equilibrium Model) combined with a habitat classification model (MOSAICS) to estimate the effects of SLR, suspended sediment, and inland habitat migration on estuarine habitats, soil carbon accumulation, and economic value of climate change mitigation of carbon accumulation (social cost of carbon dioxide) in a macrotidal estuary in the northwest USA over 100 years (2011 to 2110). Under present-day sediment levels, we projected that after 100 years, most high salt marsh would remain with &lt; 100 cm SLR, but substantial area converted to transitional (low) salt marsh and mudflat with ≥ 100 cm SLR. Increasing sediment availability increased the projected resilience of transitional salt marsh to SLR but did not prevent declines in high marsh area. Projected total carbon accumulation plateaued or declined with ≥ 100 cm SLR, yet the economic value of carbon accumulation continued to rise over time, suggesting that the value of this ecosystem service was resilient to SLR. Doubling or tripling sediment availability increased projected carbon accumulation up to 7.69 and 14.2 kg m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> and increased total economic value up to $373,000 and $710,000, respectively. Allowing marsh migration supported conversion of upland to freshwater marsh, with slight increases in carbon accumulation. These results inform climate adaptation planning for wetland managers seeking to understand the resilience of estuarine habitats and ecosystem services to SLR under multiple management strategies.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Managed realignment (MR) involves the landward relocation of sea defences to foster the (re)creation of coastal wetlands and achieve nature-based coastal protection. The wider application of MR is impeded by knowledge gaps related to lacking data on its effectiveness under extreme surges and the role of changes in vegetation cover, for example due to sea-level rise. We employ a calibrated and validated hydrodynamic model to explore relationships between surge attenuation, MR width(/area) and vegetation cover for the MR site of Freiston Shore, UK. We model a range of extreme water levels for four scenarios of variable MR width. We further assess the effects of reduced vegetation cover for the actual MR site and for the scenario of the site with the largest width. We show that surges are amplified for all but the largest two site scenarios, suggesting that increasing MR width results in higher attenuation rates. Substantial surge attenuation (up to 18 cm km<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) is only achieved for the largest site. The greatest contribution to the attenuation in the largest site scenario may come from water being reflected from the breached dike. While vegetation cover has no statistically significant effect on surge attenuations in the original MR site, higher coverage leads to higher attenuation rates in the largest site scenario. We conclude that at the open coast, only large MR sites (&gt; 1148 m width) can attenuate surges with return periods &gt; 10 years, while increased vegetation cover and larger MR widths enable the attenuation of even higher surges.</jats:p>

Adaptation strategies increasingly incorporate nature-based solutions. New science can illuminate where these solutions are appropriate in urban environments and what benefits they provide to people. Together with stakeholders in San Mateo County, California, USA, we co-developed nature-based solutions to support adaptation planning. We created six guiding principles to shape planning, summarized vulnerability to sea-level rise and opportunities for nature-based solutions, created three adaptation scenarios, and compared multiple benefits provided by each scenario. Adaptation scenarios that included investments in nature-based solutions deliver up to eight times the benefits of a traditionally engineered baseline as well as additional habitat for key species. The magnitude and distribution of benefits varied at subregional scales along the coastline. Our results demonstrate practical tools and engagement approaches to assessing the multiple benefits of nature-based solutions in an urban estuary that can be replicated in other regions.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Developing countries face risks from coastal hazards that are being amplified by climate change. The selection of effective adaptation interventions to manage these risks requires a sufficiently accurate assessment of the coastal hazard at a given location. Yet challenges remain in terms of understanding local coastal risks given the coarseness of global wave models and the paucity of locally scaled data in most developing countries, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Vanuatu. This paper aims to examine the differences in hazard assessment and adaptation option selections arising from analyses using globally versus locally scaled data on coastal processes. As a case study, we focused on an eroding cliff face in Port Resolution on Tanna Island, Vanuatu, which is of concern to the local community and government authorities. The coastal process modeling revealed that the global wave data generated unrealistically high predictions of wave height within Port Resolution Bay. Expensive engineering adaptations designed to provide coastal protection were therefore likely to fail in preventing ongoing cliff erosion. In this case, the best adaptation solution involves changing land use to revegetate and help stabilize the cliff top. Our case study highlights the importance of accurate hazard assessment, especially in data-poor regions where the extrapolation of global datasets and models in the absence of local data can result in poor adaptation decision-making. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary approach applied here can be applied in other data-poor regions to strengthen analyses exploring the benefits of local adaptation interventions.</jats:p>

Particular purpose of the study was to conduct the analytical calculation for the steady condition of wave energy density and wave heights distributions due to the presence of mangroves. The method used was an expansion of the equations for nearshore quantities from the general condition to the one with the existence of mangroves. First, the wave energy density was calculated analytically by solving the wave energy conservation equation. The analytic solution for energy quantity is a function of position variable, involving longshore currents component and other physical constant parameters. The next step was to insert the dissipation of wave energy flux due to wave breaking into another energy balance equation involving mangroves effects. The mangroves contribution is represented by the dissipation due to the existence of the plants in the water. Other quantities included in the model are the wave group velocity and the dissipation due to bottom friction flux. Then the wave heights distribution concerning the mangroves effect was derived from the wave energy density function governed.</jats:p>

The application of this natural waste is strictly limited due to lack of public knowledge about the advantage of this material for any purposes. This study aims to determine the potential application of unused and dead coral reefs by characterizing their morphology and its crystal structure. One of the major advantages of this study is to find out whether this material can is suitable to use as basic material in synthesis of hydroxyapatite. There are three types of coral reefs that obtained from the area, including Acropora cervicornis, Porites mayeri, and Pocillopora damicornis. These three types of coral reefs were characterized to determine their crystal structure using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and their morphological shape by using a digital microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The characterization procedure was carried out before the calcination process and after the procedure at a temperature of 1000°C. This study have found that the samples had different size in terms of pores. Prior to the calcination process, all samples showed a single phase that consist of calcium carbonate (CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) in the structure form of Aragonite crystal. After the calcination procedure, the crystal structure was shifted to Calcite and it was also decomposed to CaO. The particle size of the reef powder was much smaller in volume and it was more homogeneous after it went through the calcination process, in which it ranges from 3 μm to 5 μm.</jats:p>

The north coast of Bintan Island faces the open seas directly with a potential high wave and cause several characters of coastal damage, including coastal abrasion. The characteristics of sea waves are obtained by forecasting, namely converting wind speed values using the SPM (Shore Protection Manual) method. The results of this study collected comprehensive information of sea waves on the north coast during the 2015-2019 period showed a dominant pattern with the direction of sea wave propagation from north and south, while for the eastern region the wave propagation trends prevailing from north and southeast. The maximum sea wave height in the northern of Bintan Island Sea reaches 3.32 m with a period of 8.70 s while in the eastern of Bintan Island Sea the maximum of wave height condition reaches 2.90 m with a period of 8.32 s. The maximum sea wave conditions on the north and east coasts of Bintan Island occur during the north wind season (December-February) and is directly proportional to the requirements of higher wind speeds. The minimum sea wave conditions occur during the east monsoon (March-May) where during that period the wind speeds that blow are very low condition. The results of this study indicate that wind speeds in northern Bintan Island are related to wave conditions. Our research proves that higher wind speeds form higher wave conditions.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Structurally complex biogenic habitats provide foraging grounds and predation refuges for a myriad of decapod crustaceans. Many of these habitats, such as reefs formed by the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin, 1791), have been lost due to natural and anthropogenic reasons, leading to the construction of artificial reefs for habitat restoration. Previous studies have investigated the impacts of oyster reef restoration efforts on abundance patterns of decapod crustaceans, such as those of panopeid crabs, but largely ignored the influence of artificial, or created, habitat on other population characteristics such as reproductive output. We sampled five artificial reefs (constructed during 2014 or 2015) in Sweetwater Lake, Galveston Bay, Texas, USA in July-August 2016 to study the population characteristics of female panopeid mud crab Panopeus simpsoniRathbun, 1930. We quantified carapace width, counted eggs and measured dry egg mass to estimate reproductive output and determine how reef-age treatment, live-oyster abundance, and live-oyster size predicted female P. simpsoni abundance and egg production. Oyster size varied significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.001) by age treatment, and oyster abundance and size varied significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.001) between the reefs within each age treatment. The abundance of female P. simpsoni varied significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.001) between the two age treatments and was positively correlated with oyster size and reef age. The percentage of gravid females, which varied significantly (P = 0.027) among the reefs, was positively correlated with oyster abundance, and egg production was positively correlated with body size. These results suggest that oyster development on artificial reefs may influence the abundance and reproductive output of associated crustaceans such as P. simpsoni. We demonstrate that monitoring programs should not only consider population characteristics of reef-building organisms, but also the development of complex habitat structure and its impact on associated crustacean populations when determining the success of artificial habitats.</jats:p>

However, the small, low lying reef islands are commonly considered among the most geomorphically sensitive landforms to changes in sea level, wave processes, sediment supply and anthropogenic impacts. Kepulauan Seribu in the Java Sea comprise of numerous reef islands. By 2019, the islands chain is host to more than 24 thousand people. Kepulauan Seribu is affected by monsoon wind cycle. The monsoon wind also known to interact with an interannual phenomenon such as Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) which affecting regional and local wind circulation. This study aims to examine the reef shoreline response to seasonal and interannual climate variability using satellite data that encompasses yearly monsoon cycle and IOD event. Strengthens (weakens) of winds speed in the study area during the East (West) Monsoon, which in some year also coincides with a positive (negative) IOD event, are observed from 2009 to 2018 ERA - Interim by The European Centre for Medium - Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data. This variability influences the shoreline shifting in the uninhabited reef islands of Kepulauan Seribu as identified based on satellite imagery analysis. More pronounce shifted of large sediment flux are perceptible on opposing monsoon which coincides with positive/negative IOD event. Small uninhabited reef islands have ecological and economical value. Hence, enhancing coastal resilience from erosion by using conservation-types approach should be taking into consideration. Ultimately, a good understanding of climate variability that controlled changes in beach systems of reef islands is important for adequate coastal management decisions.</jats:p>

Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) SPOT-6 was employed for ground truthing. The area was only a part of mangrove forest area of Tanjung Piai which estimated about 106 ha. Although, the relationship between the spectral indices and dendrometry parameters was weak, we found a very significant between NDVI (mean) and stem density (y=10.529x + 12.773) with R2=0.1579. The sites with NDVI calculated varied from 0.10 to 0.26 (P1 and P2), under the environmental stress due to sand deposition found was regard as unhealthy vegetation areas. Whereas, site P5 with NDVI (mean) 0.67 is due to far distance from risk wave’s zone, therefore having young/growing trees with large lush green cover was regard as healthy vegetation area. High greenness indicated in TC means, the bands respond to a combination of high absorption of chlorophyll in the visible bands and the high reflectance of leaf structures in the near-infrared band, which is characteristic of healthy green vegetation.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Mangroves are formation of salt-tolerant shrubs that inhabit the inter-tidal zones of sheltered coasts like estuaries and lagoons in tropical and subtropical latitudes. They solidly secure the land from the seas, and have the capability of withstanding strong wave action and heavy storm surges. The effectiveness of mangroves as natural coastal protection buffer has been well proven in the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami that brought devastating economic and ecological impacts to thirteen Asian and African countries, including Malaysia. Despite the importance of mangroves in coastal protection, this intertidal vegetation has been reported to be depleted at an alarming annual rate of 1 to 2% globally due to impacts of natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Tremendous efforts of mangrove restoration have been implemented along the Malaysian shoreline in the past decade, but just a modest number have been planned or studied by environmentalists and other researchers. The plantings were mostly executed in a trial-and-error approach without having a full understanding of the site conditions. Hence, a thorough appreciation of the site condition is mandatory so as to ensure high survivability of the young mangrove saplings at the replanting sites. This paper aims to assess one of mangrove replanting sites in Malaysia which is located at Kg Tanjung Kepah, Lekir, Perak. Several mangrove replanting efforts have been undertaken by Forestry Department at the area. However, none of the mangrove seedlings survived three months after the plantation at the open area sites. Some assessment were conducted including mangrove tree assessment, current measurement, soil and water sampling as well as topography detailed survey. The analysis from the assessment shows that the mangrove replanting failures might be influenced by several possible factors, especially the shore slope and topography. Hence, the most suitable engineering approach will be suggested for future protection.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>In this study, we examined the succession of soil microbial communities across a chronosequence of newly constructed salt marshes constructed primarily of fine-grained dredge material, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequences. Alpha diversity in the parent material was initially low and increased to reference levels within 3 years of marsh construction, while in the newly accumulating organic matter-rich surface soils alpha diversity was initially high and remained unchanged. Microbial community succession was fastest in the surface horizon (~ 24 years to reference equivalency) and became progressively slower with depth in the subsurface horizons (~ 30–67 years). Random forest linear regression analysis was used to identify important taxa driving the trajectories toward reference conditions. In the parent material, putative sulfate-reducers (<jats:italic>Desulfobacterota</jats:italic>), methanogens (<jats:italic>Crenarchaeota</jats:italic>, especially <jats:italic>Methanosaeta</jats:italic>), and fermenters (<jats:italic>Chloroflexi</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Clostridia</jats:italic>) increased over time, suggesting an enrichment of these metabolisms over time, similar to natural marshes. Concurrently in the surface soils, the relative abundances of putative methane-, methyl-, and sulfide oxidizers, especially among <jats:italic>Gammaproteobacteria</jats:italic>, increased over time, suggesting the co-development of sulfide and methane removal metabolisms in the marsh soils. Finally, we observed that the surface soil communities at one of the marshes did not follow the trajectory of the others, exhibiting a greater relative abundance of anaerobic taxa. Uniquely in this dataset, this marsh was developing signs of excessive inundation stress in terms of vegetation coverage and soil geochemistry. Therefore, we suggest that soil microbial community structures may be effective bioindicators of salt marsh inundation and are worthy of further targeted investigation.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Coastal ecosystems play a disproportionately large role in society, and climate change is altering their ecological structure and function, as well as their highly valued goods and services. In the present article, we review the results from decade-scale research on coastal ecosystems shaped by foundation species (e.g., coral reefs, kelp forests, coastal marshes, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, barrier islands) to show how climate change is altering their ecological attributes and services. We demonstrate the value of site-based, long-term studies for quantifying the resilience of coastal systems to climate forcing, identifying thresholds that cause shifts in ecological state, and investigating the capacity of coastal ecosystems to adapt to climate change and the biological mechanisms that underlie it. We draw extensively from research conducted at coastal ecosystems studied by the US Long Term Ecological Research Network, where long-term, spatially extensive observational data are coupled with shorter-term mechanistic studies to understand the ecological consequences of climate change.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Climate-change-driven storminess and extreme events are increasingly challenging fishers in tropical island countries. Weather-based index insurance is an emerging tool that can assist fishing communities in their recovery and adaptation to such events. In these regions, coral reefs support valuable fisheries and also provide coastal protection during extreme events. Surveying 80 fishers in Grenada, this exploratory study examined fishers’ perceptions of index insurance in the context of their experiences of extreme events. We also explore perceptions of reef health and its’ connections to fishing outcomes and coastal protection, given the indirect role this plays in supporting fishers’ resilience through associated fisheries and storm protection. Most fishers viewed extreme events as a severe risk to their livelihoods, affecting their ability to make future plans. Fishers comprehended the links between improved reef health and positive impacts on fishing (higher catches and incomes). Several challenges regarding index insurance were raised, which centred on themes of flexibility, affordability, inclusivity, and accessibility. These could pose barriers to fishers and undermine demand for or participation in such schemes. As such, research, design, and implementation of future index insurance schemes should consider issues raised by fishers to ensure that provision is equitable and improve uptake.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>With coastal wader populations exhibiting long-term declines globally, understanding how they respond to changes in their preferred prey is important for future predictions, especially given the potential for warming seas to affect invertebrate populations. The cockle <jats:italic>Cerastoderma edule</jats:italic> population in the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA) in south Wales, UK, declined from 1997-2004 before an abrupt ‘crash’ in stocks between 2004 and 2010. While there has been some recovery since, stocks of larger cockles are still very low. Using survey data from the UK Wetland Bird Survey and analyses of apparent survival and biometrics from ringing, we investigated how the Burry Inlet SPA’s wintering Eurasian oystercatcher <jats:italic>Haematopus ostralegus</jats:italic> population responded to this crash. Our analysis showed that both body condition and apparent survival of wintering adult oystercatchers were reduced in the years following the cockle crash but both recovered. The number of birds using the Burry Inlet SPA decreased through the course of the cockle stock decline whilst numbers of birds in the adjacent Carmarthen Bay increased, indicating the importance of adjacent sites for buffering the effects of such changes, i.e. protected secondary habitats can be a vital component of a resilient site network. Our findings are useful in understanding how a predator copes with a serious decline in its preferred food stocks. This study has wide applicability in planning the management of coastal wetlands and shellfisheries as well as the design of resilient protected area networks in the light of environmental change.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Wild shellfish reefs have been decimated in many parts of the world over the last century, diminishing their vital ecological roles as habitat generators and the ecosystem services they provide, such as water filtration. Over this same timescale, shellfish aquaculture has rapidly expanded to become an impressive global industry with an annual worldwide production worth US$35.4 billion in 2020. Both wild reefs and aquaculture operations typically rely on abundant shellfish settlement levels to maintain their respective populations. At the same time, shellfish aquaculture has the potential to influence settlement, as the addition of cultured shellfish to an ecosystem increases the quantity of reproductive adults and may therefore increase settlement rates. Alternatively, shellfish aquaculture may lead to an overall reduction in settlement in an ecosystem, either directly through cannibalistic consumption of larvae or indirectly by straining carrying capacity. We assessed the role of marine shellfish aquaculture on settlement by comparing changes in the abundance of settling green-lipped mussels <jats:italic>Perna canaliculus</jats:italic> with the expansion of mussel farms at the north end of New Zealand’s South Island over a 47 yr timespan. Overall, mussel settlement did not increase over this period despite an estimated 16000-fold increase in the number of mussels living in the region as mussel aquaculture proliferated. The disconnect between the extent of mussel settlement and mussel aquaculture was consistent across 3 separate areas within the region, suggesting that aquaculture mussels may be unable to produce larvae capable of settlement and emphasizing the importance of wild mussel populations for ecosystem resilience.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Wave energy conversion technologies have recently attracted more attention as part of global efforts to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy resources. While ocean waves can provide renewable energy, they can also be destructive to coastal areas that are often densely populated and vulnerable to coastal erosion. There have been a variety of efforts to mitigate the impacts of wave- and storm-induced erosion; however, they are either temporary solutions or approaches that are not able to adapt to a changing climate. This study explores a green and sustainable approach to mitigating coastal erosion from hurricanes through wave energy conversion. A barrier island, Dauphin Island, off the coast of Alabama, is used as a test case. The potential use of wave energy converter farms to mitigate erosion due to hurricane storm surges while simultaneously generating renewable energy is explored through simulations that are forced with storm data using the XBeach model. It is shown that wave farms can impact coastal morphodynamics and have the potential to reduce dune and beach erosion, predominantly in the western portion of the island. The capacity of wave farms to influence coastal morphodynamics varies with the storm intensity.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Vegetated coastal ecosystems such as saltmarshes, mangroves and seagrass beds are increasingly promoted as sustainable storm and flood defence solutions by reducing wave energy. Yet, there is still intense debate on the ability of root mats to mitigate erosion, with some studies arguing that the direct contribution of roots in preventing sediment erosion is minor, while others consider them of major importance. Here, we hypothesized that the contrasting findings on the role of seagrass root mats in preventing erosion may stem from differences in sediment type. To test this idea, we investigated how root mats of seagrass that thrives in both sandy and muddy sediments mitigate wave-induced cliff erosion using <jats:italic>Zostera marina</jats:italic> in manipulative flume experiments. Results demonstrate that roots are very effective in reducing cliff erosion rates in sandy sediments. Cliff erosion rates were reduced up to 70% in sandy sediment with high seagrass root biomass. In contrast, cliff erosion rates in cohesive muddy sediments were low and unaffected by seagrass roots. This highlights the important role of seagrass roots in erosion mitigation, which has been overlooked compared to the role of canopies, which has received more attention. We suggest that management strategies should be developed to enhance the stabilization of sandy sediment, such as (1) using species with high belowground biomass, (2) using fast-growing pioneer species and (3) applying temporary stabilising measures.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Understanding the characteristics of urbanization under different flood protection levels is vital for sustainable development in coastal flood-prone areas (CFAs). However, little is known about the potential divergences of coastal urbanization across different flood protection levels in the CFAs of China. To fill this research gap, this study investigated the spatio-temporal changes of urban land expansion in Chinese CFAs and explored their relationships with flood protection levels during 2000–2020. It was found that in 2020, the urban lands accounted for 16.35% of the CFAs, 1.81 times that of the non-CFAs (9.04%). The urban lands increased rapidly in the CFAs across all flood protection levels, with an average annual change rate of 6.51%, which was 2.17 times that of non-CFAs (3.00%) and 3.68 times that of the exposed population growth rate (1.77%). Particularly in counties with low flood protection levels (&amp;lt;50 years), the urban lands expanded by 9.40% annually, 1.44 times that of the whole CFAs; moreover, a large portion (39.58%) of the new urban lands were reclaimed from sea waters. These findings suggest that special attention should be paid to coastal landscape changes in the areas of low flood protection levels to reduce flood risk and ensure sustainable cities and communities. Flood adaptation strategies should be applied to include conserving the coastal ecosystem.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>U.S. coastal economies and communities are facing an unprec¬edented and growing number of impacts to coastal ecosystems including beach and fishery closures, harmful algal blooms, loss of critical habitat, as well as shoreline damage. This paper synthesizes our present understanding of the dynamics of human and ecosystem health in coastal systems with a focus on the need to better understand nearshore physical process interactions with coastal pollutants and ecosystems (e.g. fate and transport, circulation, depositional environment, climate change). It is organized around two major topical areas and six subtopic areas: 1) Identifying and mitigating coastal pollutants, including fecal pollution, nutrients and harmful algal blooms, and microplastics; and 2) Resilient coastal ecosystems, which focuses on coastal fisheries, shellfish and natural and nature-based features (NNBF). Societal needs and the tools and tech¬nologies needed to address them are discussed for each subtopic. Recommendations for scientific research, observations, com¬munity engagement, and policies aim to help prioritize future research and investments. A better understanding of coastal physical processes and interactions with coastal pollutants and resilient ecosystems (e.g. fate and transport, circulation, depositional environment, climate change) is a critical need. Other research recommendations include the need to quantify potential threats to human and ecosystem health through ac¬curate risk assessments and to quantify the resulting hazard risk reduction of natural and nature-based features; improve pollut¬ant and ecosystem impacts forecasting by integrating frequent and new data points into existing and novel models; collect environmental data to calibrate and validate models to predict future impacts on coastal ecosystems and their evolution due to anthropogenic stressors (land-based pollution, overfishing, coastal development), climate change, and sea level rise; and develop lower cost and rapid response tools to help coastal managers better respond to pollutant and ecosystem threats.</jats:p>

We encourage the Biden administration to support international efforts to restore oyster reefs by presenting an “Oyster Restoration Initiative” to the World Economic Forum, mirroring recent actions on trees. On the domestic front, several legislative actions can be taken to sustain the current trajectory of restoration efforts. These efforts can be pursued in tandem, but we recommend that policy actions focus on expanding low carbon, oyster-based restorative aquaculture programs.

AB  - <jats:p>Tidal flats are widely distributed and provide a variety of ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the consequences of tidal flat loss and implications for services such as carbon (C) sequestration have not been assessed. In unvegetated tidal flat ecosystems, sediment is the most important carbon reservoir, similar to that of vegetated coastal wetlands (i.e., mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass). We examined the C stocks and C accumulation rate (CAR) reported from 123 locations of tidal flat around the world and compared these results with data from mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. The global average CAR of tidal flats is 129.8 g C m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, with the top-meter sediments containing on average 86.3 Mg C ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>.

Assuming the same rate of loss tidal flats as in the past three decades and that all disturbed sediment C is remineralized, 4.8 Tg C will be lost from tidal flat sediments every year, equivalent to an emission of 17.6 Tg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to the water column and atmosphere.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>This study reports findings of an analysis of modifications to the incident wave field caused by constructed Oyster Castle<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> breakwater systems at Gandys Beach Preserve in Downe Township, NJ. The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Gandys Beach Preserve is a one-mile stretch of beach located along with intertidal mud flats, sandy beaches, tidal creeks, and salt marshes. Gandys Beach can be classified as a high-energy environment, with open water fetches exceeding 30 miles, and a tidal range on the order of 2 m. The Gandys Beach living shoreline project was designed and constructed by TNC in partnership with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to investigate the effectiveness of various natural and nature-based features (NNBFs) in protecting and enhancing salt marshes and beaches in high (er) energy environments. Many of the NNBF techniques used at Gandys Beach, such as Oyster Castle<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> block breakwaters (Oyster Castles), had only been implemented at smaller scales in New Jersey prior to the project. Stevens was contracted by USFWS/TNC to evaluate the impact of the breakwater systems on incident waves. Four breakwater sections along the beach were selected to monitor wave attenuation. Month-long deployments of wave staffs and pressure sensors occurred in the summer and winter of 2019. Analysis of the data indicates that when crests of the Oyster Castles are exposed the breakwater system effectively attenuates waves. However, when the structures are submerged, wave height attenuation decreases, and under certain conditions wave heights behind Oyster Castles can be amplified more than 80%. These results are troubling, especially in areas experiencing sea level rise where the frequency of submergence will likely increase in the future. Due to the complex nature of Gandys Beach, exact mechanisms causing this amplification remain uncertain. Furthermore, transmission coefficients (<jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>t</jats:italic></jats:sub>) above 1 are not typically modeled in existing empirical equations. Seabrook and Hall (Coast. Eng.

AB  - <jats:p>This study investigates the potential of a <jats:italic>Rhizophora</jats:italic> mangrove forest of moderate cross-shore thickness to attenuate wave heights using an idealized prototype-scale physical model constructed in a 104 m long wave flume. An 18 m long cross-shore transect of an idealized red mangrove forest based on the trunk-prop root system was constructed in the flume. Two cases with forest densities of 0.75 and 0.375 stems/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and a third baseline case with no mangroves were considered. LiDAR was used to quantify the projected area per unit height and to estimate the effective diameter of the system. The methodology was accurate to within 2% of the known stem diameters and 10% of the known prop root diameters. Random and regular wave conditions seaward, throughout, and inland of the forest were measured to determine wave height decay rates and drag coefficients for relative water depths ranging 0.36 to 1.44. Wave height decay rates ranged 0.008–0.021 m<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> for the high-density cases and 0.004–0.010 m<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> for the low-density cases and were found to be a function of water depth. Doubling the forest density increased the decay rate by a factor two, consistent with previous studies for other types of emergent vegetation. Drag coefficients ranged 0.4–3.8, and were found to be dependent on the Reynolds number. Uncertainty in the estimates of the drag coefficient due to the measured projected area and measured wave attenuation was quantified and found to have average combined standard deviations of 0.58 and 0.56 for random and regular waves, respectively. Two previous reduced-scale studies of wave attenuation by mangroves compared well with the present study when their Reynolds numbers were re-scaled by <jats:italic>λ<jats:sup>3/</jats:sup></jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> where λ is the prototype-to-model geometric scale ratio. Using the combined data sets, an equation is proposed to estimate the drag coefficient for a <jats:italic>Rhizophora</jats:italic> mangrove forest: <jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>D</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 0.6 + 3e04/<jats:italic>Re</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>DBH</jats:italic></jats:sub> with an uncertainty of 0.69 over the range 5e03 &amp;lt; <jats:italic>Re</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>DBH</jats:italic></jats:sub> &amp;lt; 1.9e05, where <jats:italic>Re</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>DBH</jats:italic></jats:sub> is based on the tree diameter at breast height.

It focuses primarily on a traditional rammed earth material known as chunambo in Macao and other former Portuguese colonies. Composed of oyster shell, straw, rice, local soils and sand chemically bounded together by slacked lime, this precursor to modern day concrete has a unique combination of porosity and structural integrity that makes it particularly adaptable to tropical climates and a contrast to contemporary building practices which are often designed to create sealed interior environments. Discussions of porosity within New Materialism, Urban Studies and Chinese aesthetics will be used to think stickiness alongside questions of material integrity in the face of sea level rise, erosion and anthropogenic forces. Much like limestone sediments formed over the course of thousands of years at the bottom of ancient tropical sea beds, chunambo invites speculation about material permanence in the face of climate futures and a changing urban environment.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The Pacific oyster (<jats:italic>Magallana gigas</jats:italic>) is an invasive species in the Wadden Sea transforming parts of it permanently. <jats:italic>M. gigas</jats:italic>, as an ecosystem engineer, builds reef structures that are characterized by highly complex and variable surfaces consisting of densely packed, sharp-edged individuals connected with cement-like bonds. To investigate the interactions between reef structure, shape and formation and wave as well as tidal currents, an understanding of the surface roughness is essential. This work reports on observations of oyster reefs for which seven new structural classes (<jats:italic>Central Reef</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Transitional Zone</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cluster I</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cluster II</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Patch I</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Patch II</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Garland</jats:italic>) are proposed. For each class, high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) have been elaborated based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry and analyzed using spatial statistics. By determining probability density functions (PDFs), vertical porosity distributions, abundances, orientations and second-order structure functions (SSFs), topographical parameters that influence the hydraulic bed roughness have been determined. The results suggest, that by applying the structural classification and their distinct topographical roughness parameters, the oyster reef surfaces can be described appropriately accounting for their complexity. The roughness accounts to a total roughness height <jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>t</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 103 ± 15 mm and root-mean-square roughness height <jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>rms</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 23 ± 5 mm. These values were found similar across all structural classes, yet the shape of the PDFs reveal differences. With decreasing abundance, the distributions become more positively skewed and are characterized by more extreme outliers. This is reflected in the higher statistical moments, as the skewness ranges between <jats:italic>Sk</jats:italic> = 0.4–2.1 and the kurtosis between <jats:italic>Ku</jats:italic> = 2.2–11.5. The analysis of the orientations and the SSFs confirms anisotropic behavior across all structural classes. Further, the SSFs reveal the oyster shells as significant roughness elements with exception of <jats:italic>Cluster I</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>II</jats:italic>, where the clusters are identified as significant roughness elements. The provided set of topographical roughness parameters enhances the knowledge of oyster reef surfaces and gives insights into the interactions between biogenic structure and surrounding hydrodynamics. The new intra-reef classification allows for more accurate determination of the overall roughness as well as the population dynamics of the habitat forming oyster. Combined with hydraulic measurements, the results can be used to estimate the hydraulic bed roughness induced by the oyster reef surfaces.</jats:p>

Complementary rigid canopy experiments were also included to aid comparative insight. The flow was quantified in wall-normal planes in a developed region using high-frame-rate particle image velocimetry. Results show that the deflection and coordinated waving motion of the blades redistributed the Reynolds stresses above and below the canopy top. Critically, in-canopy turbulence associated with the seagrass lacked periodic stem wake vortex shedding present in the rigid canopy, yet the flexible canopy induced vortex shedding from the blade tips. Inspection of spatial and temporal characteristics of coherent flow structures using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition reveals that Kelvin–Helmholtz-type vortices are the dominant flow structures associated with the waving motion of the seagrass and that modulated the local flow exchange in both rigid and flexible canopies. A barrier-like effect produced by the blade deflections blocked large-scale turbulence transport, thereby reducing vortex penetration into the canopy. In addition, we uncovered a transition from sweep-dominated to ejection-dominated behaviour in the surrogate seagrass. We hypothesise that the vortices created during the upward blade motion period play a major role in the sweep-to-ejection-dominated transition. Conditionally averaged quadrant analysis on the downward and upward blade motion supports this contention.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The carbon pool of Amazonian peatlands is immense and mediates critical ecological functions. As peatlands are dynamic, similar to other wetland systems, modeling of the relationship between organic matter and dry bulk density allows the estimation of the accumulation and/or decomposition of peats. We tested several models: the generalized linear mixed logarithmic, to test depth, and the non-linear logarithmic and power-law models. There is a negative power-law relationship between organic percentage and dry bulk density using peat samples collected in Amazonian peatlands (n = 80). This model is supported by the coefficient of determination (R2) estimates garnered from model fitting, while Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values further support parsimonious models. We also ran trials of the ideal mixing model with two parameters: k1 representing organic density and k2 representing mineral. The mixture of organic and inorganic components generally falls in accordance with the theory that decreasing k1 trends with increasing k2, although k2 values for these peat samples are negative. The organic k1 coefficient allows us to identify two sites out of the nine investigated, which can be prioritized for their carbon dynamics. The presence of high-density samples, which were not related to depth, indicates clay intrusion in these peatlands. We hope the modeling can explain processes significant to these globally important carbon-rich ecosystems.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The aim of this study was to describe the traditional knowledge from artisanal fishermen related to marine artificial reef (MAR) ship Victory 8B and to identify possible changes in the fishery area after its installation. We performed single ethnographic interviews (n = 80) through a semistructured questionnaire, using participant observation, visual ethnography, and field diary recordings. All the interviewees were men from 27 to 77 years old, with low education levels and up to 60 years of experience in the fishery artisanal. Most of the interviewees (n = 71; 88.7%) recognize the presence of this MAR in the region and its role as a shelter for marine fauna and an attractor for species with commercial value. Even with fishery prohibition in the vicinity of MAR Victory 8B, most of the interviewees (n = 75; 93.7%) reported the practice in that area. According to the fishermen, the ship installation did not alter area the fishery, but the structure positively changed the activity by attracting more fish, increasing capture and profits. With that, from the perspective of the fishermen perception, MAR Victory 8B fulfilled its role in the enrichment of the fish stock and the conservation of marine biodiversity in the region.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The aim of this chapter is to report the perception of artisanal fishers regarding long-term implementation impacts of artificial reefs in the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Data was collected through 60 interviews with local and regional artisanal fishers. The fishers stated an increase in fish abundance and species richness around the reef complex and consider it very important for local fisheries due to its ability to attract commercial species. These findings were clearly supported by their positive perception regarding the installation of reef balls and how these structures have benefited the local and regional fishing community over time (&gt;25 years). In addition, the data confirms that the presence of different species in the reef complex is due to an increase of consolidated and stable substrate, which provides several types of prey and habitat for recruitment and shelter. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Structural coastal protection interventions have been implemented worldwide to stabilize channels and shorelines in tidal inlets. Although these conventional “gray” interventions typically attain their goals, there is an increasing interest and need to consider nature-based or “green” interventions that also address system resilience and environmental impacts. For a better implementation of gray to green interventions in tidal inlets, their effectiveness and their effects on the velocity of these dynamic coastal systems need to be understood. The effects on flow velocity of gray to green coastal protection interventions for tidal inlets are assessed here by exploring six interventions intended to protect against erosion on the estuarine-side shoreline near the inlet. A field-calibrated numerical model with Willmott Skill scores rated as excellent for Oregon Inlet located in North Carolina, United States, is used to simulate tidal currents under present conditions and after implementing a seawall, a set of bendway weirs, a terminal groin extension, a dual-jetty system, a flood channel relocation, and an island restoration project. Comparisons of time series of flow velocities in the flood channel along an eroding, estuarine shoreline are used to identify the effectiveness of each coastal protection alternative at reducing erosive velocities. Geospatial difference maps are used to determine velocity changes caused by each alternative throughout the inlet system. With no coastal protection interventions, the velocities along the eroding shoreline exceeded an erosive threshold velocity (defined as 0.2 m/s) during 50% of the simulated period. Alternatives closer to the green side of the coastal protection intervention spectrum, such as channel relocation and island restoration, tend to display the most effectiveness at reducing flow velocities at the eroding shoreline while resulting in minimal inlet-wide hydrodynamic changes. On the other hand, gray alternatives either cause minimal (seawall and bendway weirs) or extreme (jetties) changes in velocities throughout the inlet system. This comparison of gray and green coastal protection interventions in tidal inlets serves as an example to contrast the effectiveness of different coastal protection alternatives at reducing erosive flow velocities and to inform alternative selection at other inlet systems.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Salt marshes face chronic anthropogenic impacts such as relative sea level rise and eutrophication, as well as acute disturbances from tropical storms that can affect the productivity of these important communities. However, it is not well understood how marshes already subjected to eutrophication and sea level rise will respond to added effects of episodic storms such as hurricanes. We examined the interactive effects of nutrient addition, sea level rise, and a hurricane on the growth, biomass accumulation, and resilience of the saltmarsh cordgrass <jats:italic>Spartina alterniflora</jats:italic> in the Gulf of Mexico. In a microtidal marsh, we manipulated nutrient levels and submergence using marsh organs in which cordgrasses were planted at differing intertidal elevations and measured the impacts of Hurricane Isaac, which occurred during the experiment. Prior to the hurricane, grasses at intermediate and high elevations increased in abundance. After the hurricane, all treatments lost approximately 50% of their shoots, demonstrating that added nutrients and elevation did not provide resistance to hurricane disturbance. At the end of the experiment, only the highest elevations had been resilient to the hurricane, with increased above- and belowground growth. Added nutrients provided a modest increase in above- and belowground growth, but only at the highest elevations, suggesting that only elevation will enhance resilience to hurricane disturbance. These results empirically demonstrate that <jats:italic>S. alterniflora</jats:italic> in microtidal locations already subjected to submergence stress is less able to recover from storm disturbance and suggests we may be underestimating the loss of northern Gulf Coast marshes due to relative sea level rise.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and unsustainable coastal zone development pose serious threats to growing coastal communities. Human actions, such as shoreline development and hardening in at-risk areas, can damage nearshore ecosystems and exacerbate existing risks to coastal populations. A comprehensive understanding of shoreline changes in response to development, storm events, and sea-level rise is needed to effectively mitigate coastal hazards and promote adaptive and resilient coastlines. To determine whether human modification of shorelines can be accurately quantified and assessed over time, we evaluated past and present shoreline mapping and classification efforts in the United States. We coupled a review of available US shoreline data with a survey of coastal planners and managers involved with US state shoreline mapping programs. Using these data, we estimated the current extent of shoreline modification along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf US coasts. However, we found that quantifying shoreline modifications over time nationally—or even within a single state—is currently infeasible due to changes in shoreline resolution associated with advances in shoreline mapping methodologies and a lack of regularly updated shoreline maps. State-level analysis from surveys revealed that 20 US coastal states have undertaken shoreline mapping projects, with sixteen tracking shoreline type and/or condition. However, of the 36 shoreline maps and databases identified, only half (18) were updated regularly or had planned updates. Lacking shoreline change data, coastal communities risk accepting increasingly degraded coastal zones and making poor management decisions based on shifted baselines. Thus, we recommend increasing the scale and funding for several ongoing innovative shoreline mapping efforts. These efforts are particularly focused on improving and standardizing shoreline mapping techniques, as well as establishing accurate baselines for shoreline conditions in the United States. Without accurate baselines and regular, consistent updates to shoreline data, managers cannot manage shorelines in a way that effectively mitigates coastal hazards while also promoting socio-ecological resilience in a changing climate.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Restoring natural infrastructure offers much promise as a means to reduce both flood hazard and exposure to complement and supplement other flood damage reduction strategies. Interest increased in flood risk reduction methods using natural and naturebased features, in part, because of increased recognition that such could provide both flood risk reduction and other benefits, such as water quality uplift, community recreational space, and fish and wildlife habitat. Recent flood disasters and the rising costs of disaster response and recovery have triggered policy shifts toward economically efficient investments that enhance greater community resilience. While natural infrastructure is becoming more widely recognized as a tactic for building community and ecological resilience to erosion and flooding, it remains underutilized. Actions to aid consideration of natural infrastructure and scale up its use are presented.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Restoring degraded and damaged salt marshes has become an important initiative in the coastal wetlands management around the world. Evaluating the economic output of salt marsh restoration is of great significance for identifying the current state of knowledge gaps related to conservation activities and economic benefits. To address this question, we conducted an overview of global salt marsh restoration projects, and their financial expenses and restoration benefits in the past 40 years. The results showed that most of the saltmarsh restoration projects are near megacities and larger rivers, and restoration techniques of different regions depend on the types of disturbance factors such as climate change, extreme weather events, and land use change. With limited resources, fund allocation between protected areas and unprotected areas in middle-income countries is often unbalanced, indicating a mismatch between conservation efforts and regional needs. Although restoration projects are expensive, the evidence in this article implies that most salt marsh restoration projects could recover their financial expense in the finite time, especially for large-scale restoration activities. Besides, the great carbon sequestration potential would make salt marsh restoration projects more profitable under current efforts to promote carbon sequestration for combating global warming.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Populations of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) have been historically declining due to both natural and anthropogenic stressors. In response, oyster reefs have been created with many different approaches. This study utilized intertidal reefs constructed with oyster shells recycled from local restaurants to provide oyster settlement substrate, reef-associated faunal habitat, and a barrier to prevent marsh erosion. The objective of this study was to determine how oyster population characteristics changed over four years (2016–2019) on five different reefs within Sweetwater Lake, Galveston Bay, Texas, with a secondary objective to examine how oyster populations responded after Hurricane Harvey. Over the study period, five different reefs were sampled each summer by removing five bags per reef to determine oyster abundance and size demography. For the three years of the study (2017–2019), we also quantified oyster spat recruitment to the reefs. Oyster abundance and size (shell height) varied interactively by year and reef number, whereas oyster recruitment was significantly lower following Hurricane Harvey and then returned to pre-storm levels. Our results further highlight the importance of reef placement for breakwater-style reefs, as it appears the hydrodynamics within Sweetwater Lake influenced both oyster abundance and size among individual reefs. While the created reefs receive limited larval influx due to the narrow opening between Sweetwater Lake and Galveston Bay proper, this limited connectivity seemed to prevent mass mortality from the freshwater influx from Hurricane Harvey. Therefore, projects creating oyster reefs should consider local and regional landscape factors for the long-term success of oyster populations and robustness to natural disasters.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Oysters and barnacles are dominant inhabitants of natural and restored oyster reefs around the world, and high areal coverage of barnacles at natural or restored reefs commonly decreases substrate accessibility for oyster settlement. The overall understanding of oyster and barnacle recruitment dynamics provides invaluable information on site selection and strategies employed for oyster reef restoration. This study documented the temporal and spatial patterns of oyster and barnacle recruitment on and near the largest natural intertidal oyster reef (Liyashan) in China during 2019–2020. The oyster <jats:italic>Crassostrea sikamea</jats:italic> recruitment appeared as a continuous process from June through late November or early December, with the peak in August. Greater recruits of oyster spat occurred on the sheltered inshore at the upstream of the natural oyster reef than on the reef and the nearby open coast (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05). The barnacle recruitment extended from spring to early winter, with mid-spring and mid-summer peaks. Conversely, higher barnacle recruitment appeared on the natural oyster reef and the nearby open coast than on the sheltered inshore. Across all the monitoring sites, the cumulative recruits of oysters in each of 2019 and 2020 was negatively correlated with those of barnacles (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05). The inshore sites (SH1 and SH2) with high oyster recruitment and low barnacle recruitment should be recognized as the natural spatfall sites for the natural oyster reef restoration. The separation in the recruitment peak between the oyster and the barnacle indicated that August was the most favorable window for capturing oyster spat through substratum addition to the water around the natural reef.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Oyster reefs are structurally complex habitats which are increasingly recognized for their importance in estuarine systems. With over 85% of oyster reefs lost to human activities globally, there is increasing interest in aquaculture to not only meet the growing need for food worldwide, but also enhance ecological functions and services. Prime among these services is the provision of habitat for marine biodiversity. We assessed the biodiversity associated with an abandoned benthic oyster farm to investigate the potential ecological benefits of benthic farming techniques used in traditional oyster farms. In addition, we made note of any invasive species which may use these abandoned structures as habitat. The macrobenthic assemblage in the oyster habitat formed by the farm was different from the surrounding mudflats, containing 61 and 26 species, respectively. Density of invertebrates was similar in both habitats (~ 5,777 ± 981 indiv·m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>), but biomass in the oyster farm over ten times greater than the mudflat substrate, which had a fauna dominated by small polychaetes (&amp;lt;5 mm long). Molluscs and crustaceans were especially abundant in the oyster habitat and contributed to 90% of the enhanced biomass associated with oyster habitat (excluding oyster biomass). Only one invasive species was documented, the mussel <jats:italic>Xenostrobus secures</jats:italic>, but at densities lower than nearby artificial substrates (e.g., concrete shorelines). Oyster development on this abandoned farm appears to be self-sustaining, provide habitat and trophic support for associated benthic macrofauna. In addition to supporting higher biodiversity and biomass of associated species, traditional oyster aquaculture could improve the restoration potential of oyster reefs by supporting broodstock of native oysters, thus maintaining larval supply.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Oyster reefs are gaining more and more attention in marine ranching and coastal ecosystem restoration, but tremendous knowledge gaps still exist. In this study, we developed trophic models for the established artificial oyster reef (EAOR), newly deployed artificial oyster reef (NAOR), and non-reef bare substratum (NBS) ecosystems located in the Bay of Xiangyun, Bohai Sea, China, to assess the benefits of artificial oyster reef construction and to characterize the unique role of these reefs in coastal management. The analysis showed that the EAOR and NAOR ecosystems were similar to each other, but both were greatly different than the NBS ecosystem. Reefs showed greater “ecological size” and stronger top-down effects compared to the bare area. The ecosystems were not yet mature, but the EAOR and NAOR ecosystems had more complicated trophic relationships, greater potential to withstand perturbations, and higher biological carrying capacities of commercial organisms compared to the NBS ecosystem. These results demonstrated that artificial oyster reef construction resulted in great advantages to the ecosystem. For example, oysters became the structuring functional group and played a critical role in the trophic structure of the reef areas. The phytoplankton/detritus-oysters-carnivorous macrobenthos pathway developed and became dominant in these areas, thereby contributing to highly efficient secondary production. The ratios of total primary production/total respiration were &amp;lt; 1, indicating that the reef ecosystems responded effectively to nutrient inputs from adjacent ecosystems. We speculate that water exchange might be a critical factor influencing the maintenance of the system. Long-term monitoring of the EAOR and NAOR should be implemented for oyster protection and to assess the need to manipulate carnivorous macrobenthos to keep the systems in balance. Results of this study could benefit the restoration, exploitation, and management of oyster reefs.

AB  - <jats:p>Oyster aquaculture is expanding globally, and there has been a recent research surge examining how oyster farms alter coastal ecosystems. Yet, until now, the role of time in these studies has largely been missing. Here we used an <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> chronosequence approach to determine how the presence of oyster aquaculture (<jats:italic>Crassostrea virginica</jats:italic>) altered sediment nitrogen (N), oxygen (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), and phosphorus (P) cycling. Overall we found that the sum of nitrogen fluxes increased significantly following addition of aquaculture, and switched from net N consumption (i.e. net nitrogen fixation: -14.41 µmol N m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) to production (i.e. net denitrification: 553.57 µmol N m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>). Ammonium (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) fluxes did not differ between bare sediment and oyster aquaculture. Additionally, both the magnitude of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> fluxes oscillated on an annual scale of aquaculture age, but not predictably so. We observed significantly more variance (σ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) in dinitrogen and NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> fluxes in sediments beneath aquaculture, indicating increased non-linearity. O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes increased from Years 4 to 6, before returning to baseline conditions. There were no differences in sediment P cycling. This study demonstrates that sediment biogeochemical processes can become non-linear under the pressure of oyster aquaculture, and this non-linearity likely has important implications for ecosystem function.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Oyster and shoreline restoration is occurring around the globe to recover lost ecosystem services. In the state of Florida, USA, dozens of estuarine habitat restoration projects are underway. These projects have traditionally relied on both natural and man-made materials, including plastics. As the impacts of plastics on marine ecosystems are better understood, practitioners are increasingly focused on plastic-free restoration. To better understand this transition, we surveyed Florida restoration practitioners in April 2021 to capture current non-plastic restoration project trends and their status. Our descriptive survey goals were to understand: (1) what non-plastic materials have been tested, (2) trade-offs between plastic and non-plastic materials (e.g., cost, sourcing, volunteer engagement), and (3) the performance of non-plastic materials. Responses indicated that a variety of non-plastic materials are currently being used, including rock, cement-infused jute structures, cement Reef Balls™ (Reef Ball Foundation, USA), BESE-elements®, and metal gabions. Overall, these materials are more expensive and equally or more difficult to install than previously popular plastic-based materials. No “best” non-plastic material emerged from our survey in part because many novel materials have been deployed for under three years. Long-term performance under a variety of abiotic and biotic conditions is thus a future research priority.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Nature-based strategies, such as wave attenuation by tidal marshes, are increasingly proposed as a complement to mitigate the risks of failure of engineered flood defense structures such as levees. However, recent analysis of historic coastal storms revealed smaller dike breach dimensions if there were natural, high tidal marshes in front of the dikes. Since tidal marshes naturally only experience weak flow velocities (~0-0.3 ms<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> during normal spring tides), we lack direct observations on the stability of tidal marsh sediments and vegetation under extreme flow velocities (order of several ms<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) as may occur when a dike behind a marsh breaches. As a first approximation, the stability of a tidal marsh sediment bed and winter-state vegetation under high flow velocities were tested in a flume. Marsh monoliths were excavated from <jats:italic>Phragmites australis</jats:italic> marshes in front of a dike along the Scheldt estuary (Dutch-Belgian border area) and installed in a 10 m long flume test section. Both sediment bed and vegetation responses were quantified over 6 experimental runs under high flow velocities up to 1.75 ms<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and water depth up to 0.35 m for 2 hours. These tests showed that even after a cumulative 12 hours exposure to high flow velocities, erosion was limited to as little as a few millimeters. Manual removal of the aboveground vegetation did not enhance the erosion either. Present findings may be related to the strongly consolidated, clay- and silt-rich sediment and <jats:italic>P. australis</jats:italic> root system in this experiment. During the flow exposure, the <jats:italic>P. australis</jats:italic> stems were strongly bent by the water flow, but the majority of all shoots recovered rapidly when the flow had stopped. Although present results may not be blindly extrapolated to all other marsh types, they do provide a strong first indication that marshes can remain stable under high flow conditions, and confirm the potential of well-developed tidal marshes as a valuable extra natural barrier reducing flood discharges towards the hinterland, following a dike breach. These outcomes promote the consideration to implement tidal marshes as part of the overall flood defense and to rethink dike strengthening in the future.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) are promoted as alternatives to structural flood protection measures. Progress has been made in understanding the physics and engineering of these systems; however, engineering, ecological, and social barriers to implementation remain. This paper identifies these barriers using the results of a literature review and summary of expert opinion; contrasts the state of the practice of NNBF with traditional structures; and details the main engineering challenges to NNBF implementation, including the uncertainty in current calculation techniques and lack of engineering design guidelines. We suggest that emergent vegetation systems can be designed with the current body of information, and an example framework is proposed for assessing these systems for their wave attenuation performance. The framework is discussed in the context of risk, and future research priorities are presented.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Microplastics (MPs) are a ubiquitous pollutant, emphasizing the need to understand their abundance and the factors that influence these patterns around the globe. In a prior study, high numbers of MPs were found in surface waters and tissues of the oyster Crassostrea virginica collected from one location in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL, FL, USA). To better understand spatial and temporal variability of MPs throughout the IRL, for one year, monthly surface water samples were collected from 35 sites, while oysters were collected quarterly from 12 sites. Microscopy and ATR-FTIR were used to quantify MP. In total, 3755 MPs were found in 44% of water samples (mean density ± CI: 1.47 ± 0.09 MP/L). South IRL water had the most MPs, likely associated with proximity to urbanization, inlets (MP sinks) and tributaries (MP sources). MP (n = 3181) were found in 70% of examined C. virginica (n = 1402). Abundances of MP in oysters were lower in the spring and in north IRL. The overall mean abundance was 2.26 ± 0.16 MP/oyster, and the density was 2.43 ± 0.52 MP/g wet tissue weight. Our results provide a more complete picture of MPs in the IRL, a subtropical, shallow-water estuarine system.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Mangrove-forest sustainability hinges upon propagule recruitment and seedling retention. This study evaluates biophysical limitations to mangrove-seedling persistence by measuring anchoring force of two mangrove species (Rhizophora mangle L. and Avicennia germinans (L.) L.). Anchoring force was measured in 362 seedlings via lateral pull tests administered in mangrove forests of two subtropical estuaries and in laboratory-based experiments. Removal mechanism varied with seedling age: newly established seedlings failed due to root pull-out while seedlings older than 3 months failed by root breakage. The anchoring force of R. mangle seedlings was consistently and significantly greater than A. germinans (p = 0.002); however, force to remove A. germinans seedlings increased with growth at a faster rate (p &lt; 0.001; A. germinans: 0.20–0.23 N/g biomass; R. mangle: 0.04–0.07 N/g biomass). Increasing density of surrounding vegetation had a positive effect (p = 0.04) on anchoring force of both species. Critical velocities at which seedlings become susceptible to instantaneous uprooting estimated from anchoring forces measured in the field were 1.20 m/s and 1.50 m/s, respectively, for R. mangle and A. germinans. As estimated critical velocities exceed typical flow magnitudes observed in field sites, removal of established seedlings likely occurs following erosion of sediments from the seedling base.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Louisiana, U.S.A., is among the world's most vulnerable places to coastal flooding. Increasing frequency/intensity of natural hazards under climate change scenarios is expected to exacerbate Louisiana's coastal flood risk. Although many factors are involved, land subsidence from marshland compaction and underground resource extraction, shoreline erosion accelerated by eustatic sea level rise (ESLR), and tropical-cyclone-induced storm surge are among the most important. While past research has focused on flood risk assessment and mitigation strategies, including climate change scenarios, few studies examine all of these factors collectively. This study shows present pluvial flood depth and the contributions of additional coastal subsidence and ESLR toward future (2050) pluvial flooding. Then, current tropical-storm-induced storm surge and future storm surge depth modeled by Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) under climate change scenarios are presented. Present and future 100-year pluvial flood and storm surge losses (separately, 2020$) to structures and their contents are estimated at the individual building level for Grand Isle, Louisiana, a barrier island town of ecological, economic, historical, recreational, cultural, and aesthetic treasure. Results suggest that the average 100-year pluvial flood depth in buildings will increase by 1.35 feet by 2050, with subsidence contributing over 82% of this total. Subsidence is projected to escalate structure and content losses by ~17% above losses in 2017, while ESLR may contribute ~3% above 2017 losses. A 100-year tropical-cyclone-induced storm surge event amid a “low” scenario of environmental change as defined by CPRA would increase Grand Isle's structure and content losses by 68–74% above the 2017 value by 2027, 141–149% by 2042, and 346–359% by 2067. The (“high”) scenario of environmental change would increase the 100-year storm surge losses by 85–91% above the 2017 value by 2027, 199–218% by 2042, and 407–415% by 2067. Outcomes from this study will offer a more realistic risk assessment model and will direct flood risk managers, property owners, and other stakeholders to build a comprehensive framework to minimize future flood risk in one of the most vulnerable sites in the U.S.A. to coastal flooding.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Large structures are introduced into deep-water marine environments by several industrial activities, including hydrocarbon exploitation. Anthropogenic structures can alter ecosystem structure and functioning in many marine ecosystems but the responses on continental margins are poorly known. Here, we investigate the short-term response of benthic megafauna to the installation of a 56 km-long 30 cm diameter pipeline on the Angolan Margin (Block 31) from 700 to 1800 m water depth using remotely operated vehicle imagery. Clear depth-related patterns exist in the density, diversity and community structure of megafauna observed in 2013 prior to pipeline installation. These patterns are altered in a subsequent survey in 2014, three-months after pipeline installation. Significant increases in density, particularly in mid-slope regions are observed. Diversity is generally, but not consistently, enhanced, particularly in the shallower areas in 2014. Clear changes are noted in community structure between years. These changes are primarily caused by increases in the abundance of echinoderms, particularly the echinoid <jats:italic>Phormosoma</jats:italic> sp. indet. There was no evidence of colonisation of the pipeline in three months by visible fauna. The few large anemones observed attached to the pipe may be able to move as adults. The pipeline appeared to trap organic material and anthropogenic litter, and may enhance available food resources locally as well as providing hard substratum. These results indicate complex and ecosystem-dependent responses to structure installation and caution against simplistic approaches to environmental management.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Investigation of the effectiveness of Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) for protecting shorelines from ship wake is increasingly important with continued development along the coast, especially when combined with sea level rise. Studies that investigate the wave energy dissipation capacity of different techniques and account for variation in context will lead to improvements and innovation in designed NNBF. Few studies have examined the performance of NNBF in protecting shorelines from ship wake. In this study of a low-sloping estuarine shoreline adjacent to a major shipping route, a natural design using coir logs and wooden staking was implemented in a T-head groin configuration. Pressure transducers and electromagnetic current meters were deployed over ∼1.5 months to investigate the energy dissipation and velocity attenuation capabilities of the installation. Results indicate that ship wakes account for 25%–50% of the total daily energy impacting the shoreline at the study site. Peak background velocities are typically over 50% smaller than the largest ship wake velocities. Field data and results of the fully nonlinear Boussinesq model, FUNWAVE-TVD, indicate that the installation is capable of decreasing energy impacting the shoreline by 10%–80% and is effective over the lower 50% of the tidal range and when submerged up to twice its height. Elevation surveys of the site indicate accrual of sediment within the installation, suggesting wave diffraction patterns promoting further accretion at the site over time. Observations indicate that coir logs may be effective in reducing wave energy from ship wakes but may fail under storm conditions in a moderate fetch confined channel. Findings from this study illustrate the opportunities and challenges nature-based solutions face in addressing ship wakes, and their ability to protect shorelines under high energy stressors.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Intertidal salt marshes provide a range of valuable ecosystem services which typically increase with marsh width. Understanding the drivers for salt marsh expansion versus retreat is thus key to managers. Previous research highlights the influence of short-term (daily/event) bed level dynamics on germination and establishment and subsequent vegetation presence. However, more recent literature suggests the importance of medium-term seasonal bed level dynamics on viable seed availability and subsequent vegetation presence. This study aims to assess event-based and seasonal bed level dynamics for vegetation presence in natural and semi-natural salt marshes and to provide generic thresholds for vegetation presence. To gain insight into bed level dynamics, data was used from autonomous Optical and Acoustic Surface Elevation Dynamics sensors (O-SED and A-SED) around the edge of natural and semi-natural salt marshes. Sensors were installed at vegetated and unvegetated measurement station Field observations from 22 O-SEDs deployed at 4 well-established natural salt marshes in the Western Scheldt estuary and 4 O-SEDs at a well-established semi-natural salt marsh in the Wadden Sea were reanalyzed. Six novel A-SEDs were deployed at a pioneer semi-natural salt marsh in the Ems-Dollard Estuary. The measurement duration at all salt marshes was at least 1 year. The A-SED sensor was successfully validated against manual measurements. Furthermore, vegetation data and water level data were obtained. No significant difference was observed between natural and semi-natural salt marshes. However, a significant difference between vegetated and unvegetated measurement stations for short-term bed level dynamics was observed. Vegetation was found to be present at locations restricted by short-term bed level variability smaller than or equal to 12 mm, emphasizing the presence of a short-term threshold. Although trends in the non-growing season were significantly different between vegetated and unvegetated stations, seasonal thresholds for vegetation presence were not found. The findings imply that knowledge of bed level-dynamics in well-established natural marshes can be used to predict vegetation presence in constructed semi-natural marshes. The importance of local short-term dynamics for vegetation presence instead of longer-term dynamics highlights possibilities for developing favorable conditions for vegetation presence in marsh restoration projects and the construction of new salt marsh ecosystems.</jats:p>

The results of this study can be incorporated into the design of submerged artificial and natural breakwaters.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>In recent years, climate change has been widely discussed around the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) in 2021, which stated that with the intensification of global warming, heavy rainfalls are becoming more severe and frequent. Economic development in recent years has also caused the proportion of impervious areas in urban regions to increase with the advancement of urbanization. When the two aforementioned factors are coupled together, the result is faster surface runoff speeds and reduced infiltration rates, which in turn result in worse flooding. Thus, water disaster mitigation is becoming a topic of great importance to developed and developing countries. This study examined five Nature-based Solutions (NbS) cases (A, B C, D, E) for the Nangang river in Taiwan. Case A is to design levees with a 100-year return period flood design standard. Under steady flow conditions, floods can be smoothly discharged downstream without any significant inundation in most situations. Case B and C used gabions with a 10-year return period flood design standard and discontinuous levees with a 25-year return period flood design standard, respectively. Though neither case is as effective in flood mitigation, both cases B and C can still reduce inundation from the flooding disaster relatively well. Case D is to dredge local areas of the main channel, but the steady flow simulation showed little flood mitigation effect. Case E is the implementation of “Room for the River”, and employs main channel dredging and floodplain land grading to increase flood conveyance capacity. Case E provides good flood mitigation.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>In order to mitigate the degradation of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in Mosquito Lagoon (ML) along the east coast of central Florida, oyster reef restoration efforts have been in place for over 14 years. These restored reefs are successful in terms of universal oyster metrics (i.e., density, shell height, reef height) and are similar to natural reefs. However, little is known about the impact of this restoration on bird populations. ML provides a habitat for many bird species, including several listed as “threatened” by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Many of these birds rely on oyster reefs for foraging and loafing habitats. As benthic invertebrates serve as an important food source for coastal birds, we monitored the abundances and diversity of these organisms on live, restored, and dead reefs. We collected sediment samples from the reef sites pre-restoration, and one month, six months, one year, two years, and three years post-restoration. We counted benthic invertebrates present in the sediment samples, and sorted them by taxa (polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, gastropods, bivalves, decapods). Benthic invertebrate abundances on restored reefs became similar to live reefs over time (species composition, density), indicating that the prey base on restored reefs was similar to that of live reefs within 6 months. A second objective of this study was to determine if restored oyster reefs reach the same abundances, foraging behaviors, and diversity of bird species on natural, live reefs. We conducted monthly bird surveys to assess bird utilization of live, restored, and dead reefs. After three years, the abundances, behaviors, and assemblages of birds on restored reefs were similar to live reefs.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>In densely populated coastal areas with sea-level rise (SLR), protecting the shorelines against erosion due to the wave impact is crucial. Along with many engineered structures like seawalls and breakwaters, there are also green structures like constructed oyster reefs (CORs) that can not only attenuate the incident waves but also grow and maintain pace with SLR. However, there is a lack of data and understanding of the long-term wave attenuation capacity of the living shoreline structures under SLR. In this study, we used the phase-resolving Boussinesq model, FUNWAVE-TVD, to examine the hydrodynamics including wave height and wave-induced currents around the CORs in the Gandys Beach living shoreline project area in the upper Delaware Bay, United States. Waves were measured at six locations (offshore to onshore, with and without CORs) in the Gandys Beach living shoreline project area for two winter months, during which four nor’easters occurred. We selected three cases that represent prevailing wind, wave, and tide conditions to examine the fine spatial and temporal changes in wave height and current velocity by the construction of the reefs. Wave heights and wave energy spectra generated from FUNWAVE-TVD were then validated with field observations. It is found that FUNWAVE-TVD is capable of simulating waves and associated hydrodynamic processes that interact with CORs. The model results show that wave attenuation rates vary with the incident wave properties and water depth, and wave-induced circulation patterns are affected by the CORs. The wave attenuation capacity of CORs over the next 100 years was simulated with the incorporation of the oyster reef optimal growth zone. Our study found that sustainable wave attenuation capacity can only be achieved when suitable habitat for COR is provided, thus it can vertically grow with SLR. Suitable habitat includes optimal intertidal inundation duration, current velocity for larval transport and settlement, on-reef oyster survival and growth, and other environmental conditions including salinity, temperature, and nutrient availability. Furthermore, the model results suggest that it would take CORs approximately 9 years after construction to reach and maintain the maximum wave attenuation capacity in sustainable living shorelines.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Identifying features of biogenic (i.e., living) habitat that attract and retain organisms is a key pursuit in ecological habitat selection research. Here we present an integrative method for creating aquatic artificial habitat modules that allow the user to isolate and flexibly manipulate structural and compositional features of replicated biogenic habitats for a range of habitat selection study designs in aquatic environments: This method combines techniques from engineering (3D scanning and printing), paleontology, and visual art (moulding and casting) into a stream-lined work flow that is likely to perform on par with or better than other techniques widely used to create artificial replicas of biogenic habitats in terms of design accessibility (availability and cost of construction materials and equipment, and training requirements), scalability (durability, ease of deployment, and reproducibility), and the ecology of the artificial habitat module (degree to which structural and compositional features of the habitat elicit appropriate visual, chemosensory, and auditory cues, and impact of the structure on the surrounding environment). This method can be flexibly modified to answer a variety of questions regarding habitat selection cues, for a range of aquatic biogenic habitat types, and can be adapted for theoretical and applied contexts including cue studies and restoration planning.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Habitat suitability models have been used for decades to develop spatially explicit predictions of landscape capacity to support populations of target species. As high-resolution remote sensing data are increasingly included in habitat suitability models that inform spatial conservation and restoration decisions, it is essential to validate model predictions with independent, quantitative data collected over sustained time frames. Here, we used data collected from 12 reefs over a 14 yr sampling period to validate a recently developed physical habitat suitability model for intertidal oyster reefs in coastal Virginia, USA. The model used intertidal elevation, water residence time, and fetch to predict the likelihood of suitable conditions for eastern oysters <jats:italic>Crassostrea virginica</jats:italic> across a coastal landscape, and remotely sensed elevation was the most restrictive parameter in the model. Model validation revealed that adult oyster biomass was on average 1.5 times greater on oyster reefs located in predicted ‘suitable’ habitat relative to reefs located in predicted ‘less suitable’ habitat over the 14 yr sampling period. By validating this model with long-term population data, we highlight the importance of elevation as a driver of sustained intertidal oyster success. These findings extend the validation of habitat suitability models by quantitatively supporting the inclusion of remotely sensed data in habitat suitability models for intertidal species. Our results suggest that future oyster restoration and aquaculture projects could enhance oyster biomass by using habitat suitability models to select optimal site locations.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Habitat loss is a serious issue threatening biodiversity across the planet, including coastal habitats that support important fish populations. Many coastal areas have been extensively modified by the construction of infrastructure such as ports, seawalls, docks, and armored shorelines. In addition, habitat restoration and enhancement projects often include constructed breakwaters or reefs. Such infrastructure may have incidental or intended habitat values for fish, yet their physical complexity makes quantitatively sampling these habitats with traditional gears challenging. We used a fleet of unbaited underwater video cameras to quantify fish communities across a variety of constructed and natural habitats in Perdido and Pensacola Bays in the central northern Gulf of Mexico. Between 2019 and 2021, we collected almost 350 replicate 10 min point census videos from rock jetty, seawall, commercial, public, and private docks, artificial reef, restored oyster reef, seagrass, and shallow sandy habitats. We extracted standard metrics of Frequency of Occurrence and MaxN, as well as more recently developed MeanCount for each taxon observed. Using a simple method to measure the visibility range at each sampling site, we calculated the area of the field of view to convert MeanCount to density estimates. Our data revealed abundant fish assemblages on constructed habitats, dominated by important fisheries species, including grey snapper Lutjanus griseus and sheepshead Archosargus probatocephalus. Our analyses suggest that density estimates may be obtained for larger fisheries species under suitable conditions. Although video is limited in more turbid estuarine areas, where conditions allow, it offers a tool to quantify fish communities in structurally complex habitats inaccessible to other quantitative gears.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Global change processes such as sea level rise and the increasing frequency of severe storms threaten many coastlines around the world and trigger the need for interventions to make these often densely-populated areas safer. Mangroves could be implemented in Nature-Based Flood Defense, provided that we know how to conserve and restore these ecosystems at those locations where they are most needed. In this study, we investigate how best to restore mangroves along an aquaculture coast that is subject to land-subsidence, comparing two common mangrove restoration methods: 1) mangrove restoration by planting and 2) Ecological Mangrove Restoration (EMR); the assistance of natural mangrove regeneration through mangrove habitat restoration. Satellite data revealed that historically, landward mangrove expansion into the active pond zone has mainly occurred through mangrove planting on pond bunds. However, there is potential to create greenbelts along waterways by means of EMR measures, as propagule trap data from the field revealed that propagules of pioneer species were up to 21 times more abundant in creeks of the pond zone than near their source in the coastal zone. This was especially true during the prevailing onshore winds of the wet-season, suggesting that smart seasonal sluice gate management could help to efficiently trap seeds in target ponds. In the coastal zone, field experiments showed that permeable brushwood dams, aimed at expanding mangrove habitat, could not sufficiently overcome subsidence rates to increase natural mangrove expansion in the seaward direction, but did significantly increase the survival of already established (planted) seedlings compared to more wave-exposed sites. The survival and growth rate of EMR-supported plantings greatly varied between species. Out of the four planted species, <jats:italic>Rhizophora mucronata</jats:italic> had the highest survival (67%) but the lowest growth rate. Whereas the pioneer species <jats:italic>Avicennia alba</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Avicennia marina</jats:italic> had lower survival rates (resp. 35 and 21%), but significantly higher growth rates, even resulting in fruiting young trees within a 16-month timeframe. Overall, we conclude that 1) EMR has potential in the pond zone, given that propagules were observed to reach well into the backwaters; and 2) that mangrove recovery in the coastal zone may be facilitated even at very challenging coastal sites by combining EMR with the planting of pioneer species.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Four pressure gauges were deployed along natural marsh transects in Mobile, Alabama, to assess the ability of marsh vegetation to reduce the height and energy of oncoming boat wakes. The present study explores the influence of vegetation species, marsh density, wave height, wave frequency, and seabed terrain on the degree of attenuation. The pressure data were translated into instantaneous free surface position and wave height measurements, and the influence of shoaling and wave breaking was accounted for. It was found that attenuation is nonlinear, with an increased concentration of wave height and energy loss occurring in the first few meters, and that the seabed plays a significant role in wave transformation. The highest 1% of wave heights was most effectively reduced due to the combined influence of terrain and vegetation while the mean wave heights were the least reduced wave height statistic. Determination of accurate decay coefficients was complicated by the high degree of variability observed within the study. The results showed a correlation between wave frequency and energy dissipation, with the most substantial loss occurring at the peak frequency. Collectively, the findings highlight the variability between marsh sites and reinforce the recommendation that there be further exploration of wave energy attenuation by marsh grasses.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Essential fish habitat is critical for foraging, breeding, or as refugia. As such, restoration of these habitats has the potential to increase the diversity and abundance of fishes. Here, we explored how fish communities responded in the first 12-24 mo following oyster reef restoration. Study sites included 8 restored reefs plus 4 live and 4 dead reefs as controls. Oyster reef metrics (e.g. density, height, thickness) and fish abundance and diversity metrics were quantified, including species richness, Shannon diversity, Simpson’s diversity, and Pielou’s evenness. Species composition was explored further to identify indicator species and assess habitat preferences. Patterns of fish community diversity and species composition were compared to oyster reef metrics to discern what oyster reef characteristics best predict fish diversity. Results showed that intertidal oyster reefs were structurally restored and shifted from resembling negative control reefs to positive control reefs within 12-24 mo. Across all treatment types, oyster shell height and reef thickness were the best predictors of fish diversity. However, at the fish community level, assemblages at restored reefs were similar to those at positive and negative controls. Species-level analyses suggest treatment types have unique indicator species, including <jats:italic>Chilomycterus schoepfi</jats:italic> (striped burrfish) for dead reefs, <jats:italic>Lutjanus synagris</jats:italic> (lane snapper) for restored reefs, and <jats:italic>Gobiosoma robustum</jats:italic> (code goby) for live reefs. This work suggests fishes can be used as higher trophic level indicators of restoration success, and ecosystem-based approaches, such as habitat restoration, can restore essential fish habitat, thus benefiting fish communities while moving coastal ecosystems toward sustainability.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Ecolabels are increasingly being used to notify consumers that the labeled product imposes minimal harm to the environment or other natural resources. A growing number of studies have signaled that consumers respond to these labels, which can promote environmentally friendly production of consumable goods and incentivize growers to produce sustainably sourced goods. Shellfish are noticeably absent among these labeled products, but they are arguably the most sustainable source of animal protein. Additionally, while in the water, oysters and other shellfish provide numerous ecosystem services that improve environmental quality. We argue that shellfish aquaculture is uniquely positioned to take advantage of ecolabeling to improve public perception and steer consumers towards a highly sustainable source of animal protein. However, we also argue more research is needed to better understand how ecosystem services vary among different production modes of oyster aquaculture to ensure products are correctly labeled and inspire consumer confidence.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are experiencing long-term shifts in size structure, including steep declines in small colonies, driving major concerns for recovery through the supply of new recruits. Whilst coral restoration began on the GBR in 2018, the combined influence of natural recruitment and outplanting for coral population recovery has not been evaluated. Here, we assessed 2 sites (Rayban and Mojo) at Opal Reef that were subject to intensive outplant efforts over a 3 yr period (2018-2021). Coral cover did not change significantly, with a baseline of 15% in 2018 and a cover of 28 and 25% in Rayban outplant and control areas, respectively, in 2021, while Mojo exhibited a coral cover of 38% in 2018 and 52% (outplant area) and 29% (control area) in 2021. Natural recruitment in 2021 did not vary by site and was characterised by a settlement rate of 5.5 and 3.7 recruits tile<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at Rayban and Mojo, respectively. Juvenile coral abundance and diversity were similar for control and outplant areas at each site. Over the 3 yr period, coral cover as a metric did not identify differences between control and outplant areas; however, size-frequency distributions of key coral taxa revealed a higher frequency of small to mid-sized colonies in outplant communities compared to controls. Given that no differences were observed in recruitment rates or juvenile abundances, variations in population structure appear to be driven by planting efforts rather than natural recovery. Our results demonstrate the need for combined monitoring of natural versus intervention-based rehabilitation to understand the impact of coral propagation efforts for local site recovery.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Connecticut marshes, like other marshes in the world, are vulnerable to anthropogenic and climate change effects. However, assessment of current sea level rise and average marsh accretion rates in Connecticut demonstrate sea level rise is not the main vulnerable factor for salt marshes loss. The study on the feasibility of developing an ecosystem-based on two coastlines in Connecticut, Guilford and Stratford, shows that both coastlines, like other coastlines in Connecticut, have limited wave energy, which is a positive factor for marsh growth. The available data assessment represents that sediment supply is the most important parameter to guarantee the resilience and sustainability of a newly developed salt marsh system in Connecticut. In Stratford, conditions for establishing a new ecosystem seem to be better, as the fetch length is pretty small, and there is some sediment supply for the ecosystem. In Guilford, wave energy is limited, but it is more than in Stratford case. Besides, sediment availability is low and the coastline experienced considerable erosion during hurricane Sandy and has not recovered yet.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Coastal wetlands are dynamic bio-physical systems in which vegetation affects the movement of water and sediment, which in turn build and maintain the landform and ecosystem. Wetlands are an effective buffer against coastal erosion and flooding, enhance water quality and human health and wellbeing. Numerous field and laboratory experiments have quantified the reduction of waves by coastal ecosystems. Numerical models, however, are only able to capture observed reduction in wave energy when calibration coefficients are obtained by comparison with measured dissipation rates. A deeper understanding of how wave attenuation varies over time, with local flow conditions and ecosystem properties, is still lacking and should be acquired from a greater range of ecosystem types and geographical settings. Few studies have observed the detailed seasonal variations in how coastal wetlands function as wave buffers and how such seasonal variations might be explained. Equally, few studies have focused on the effect of coastal reed beds on wave dynamics. This study addresses both: i) seasonal variability in wave dissipation through reed vegetation and ii) intricate connections between reed vegetation and the physical context (meteorological and topographical) that might explain such variability. We present observations of wind generated wave transformation through two <jats:italic>Phragmites australis</jats:italic> reed beds in the Razelm-Sinoe Lagoon System, Danube Delta, Romania. We find that seasonal changes in vegetation density and biomass, as well as meteorological conditions, affect observed wave conditions within the first few meters of the reed beds. Our results also show a preferential reduction of higher frequency waves, irrespective of reed stem diameter or density and suggest the potential importance of seasonal vegetation debris to observed wave dissipation. Such complex and non-linear biogeomorphic effects on wave dissipation are not currently well understood or captured in the parameterisation of vegetation-induced wave dissipation. Our study highlights the importance of an accurate and temporally granular quantification of nearshore bathymetry, wetland topography, and vegetation to fully understand, model, and manage bio-physical interactions in coastal wetlands. More specifically, our results point towards the need for spatially and temporally explicit wave decay functions in emergent reed vegetation. This is particularly critical where the accurate evaluation of the flood and erosion risk contribution of any wetland is required as part of nature-based coastal protection solutions.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Coastal risk reduction features are often built to protect infrastructure and ecosystems from damaging waves, sea level rise, and shoreline erosion. Engineers often use predictive numerical modeling tools, such as Delft3D to help design optimal intervention strategies. Still, their use by coastal managers for optimizing the design of living shorelines in complex geomorphic environments has been limited. In this study, the Delft3D modeling suite is used to help select the optimum living shoreline structure for a complex inlet and bay system at Carancahua Bay, Texas. To achieve this goal, an extensive array of sensors was deployed to collect hydrodynamic and geotechnical data in the field, and historical shoreline changes were assessed using image analysis. The measured data were then used to parameterize and validate the baseline Delft3D model. Using this validated model, the hydrodynamics resulting from a series of structural alternatives were simulated and compared. The results showed that the mouth of this complex inlet has widened greatly since the 1800s due to wave erosion and sea level rise. The analysis of the structural alternatives showed it was not advisable to attempt a return of the inlet to its historical extent, but rather to create a hybrid design that allowed for limited flow to continue through a secondary inlet. The numerical modeling effort helped to identify how to best reduce wave and flow energy. This study provides a template for the application of Delft3D as a tool for living shoreline design selection under complex shallow-estuary and inlet dynamics.</jats:p>

Nature-based solutions in the form of coral restoration, while not perfect, can assist in rebuilding reef structure and improving the flow of the service for some sites. With a financing gap existing between what is required for conservation and what is being accessed, private investors should be playing a larger role in such restoration activities. Especially so as coastal hoteliers in particular, benefit from stable beaches and also have additional income generating potential with healthy reefs. Blended finance solutions in particular, are especially suited to restoration that incorporates substrate addition, while payments for ecosystem services are more suited to coral gardening. Conservation and finance practitioners must engage further and understand each other’s worlds, in order for these private sources to be effectively sourced and utilized.</jats:p>

This study investigates the vulnerability of a segment of highway passing through the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge in the Outer Banks, North Carolina, USA. Publicly available data, computational modeling, and field observations of shoreline change are synthesized to develop fragility models for roadway flooding and marsh conditions. At 99% significance, peak daily water levels and significant wave heights at nearby monitoring stations are determined as significant predictors of roadway closure due to flooding. Computational investigations of bay-side storms identify peak water levels and the buffer distance between the estuarine shoreline and the roadway as significant predictors of roadway transect flooding. To assess the vulnerability of the marsh in the buffer area, a classification scheme is proposed and used to evaluate marsh conditions due to long-term and episodic (storm) stressors. Marsh vulnerability is found to be predicted by the long-term erosion rate and distance from the shoreline to the 5 m depth contour of the nearby flood tidal channel. The results indicate the importance of erosion mitigation and marsh conservation to enhance the resilience of coastal transportation infrastructure.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Coastal erosion poses an urgent threat to life and property in low-lying regions. Sand nourishment is increasingly used as a nature-based solution but requires significant natural resources and replenishment over time. In this study, a novel form of nourishment is explored that combines shoreface nourishment and seagrass restoration to mitigate coastal erosion (i.e., green nourishment). Using the coastal morphodynamic model Xbeach, the impact of seagrass planting on wave energy dissipation, sediment erosion and transport, and morphological evolution of a cross-shore profile was studied for mild wave conditions and an intense storm. Model results indicate that a seagrass meadow enhances the wave energy dissipation provided by a shoreface nourishment, and suggests that it may be particularly effective in sediment transport mitigation when implemented in a sheltered nearshore area. The shoreface nourishment reduced the wave height on the seagrass meadow, and reduced the rate of seagrass destruction by deposition or erosion above the grass height after the storm event. Green nourishment also reduced beach foreshore erosion caused by a simulated storm event. An alternative, more cost-effective planting technique using seagrass seeds was explored, which showed similar coastal erosion protection benefits for seagrass transplants. This modeling study found that green nourishment is potentially an effective nature-based solution for coastal erosion and flooding on sandy coasts, and future studies are recommended to evaluate its morphological, ecological and flood risk reduction benefits in the field.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Coastal communities around the world are facing increased coastal flooding and shoreline erosion from factors such as sea-level rise and unsustainable development practices. Coastal engineers and managers often rely on gray infrastructure such as seawalls, levees and breakwaters, but are increasingly seeking to incorporate more sustainable natural and nature-based features (NNBF). While coastal restoration projects have been happening for decades, NNBF projects go above and beyond coastal restoration. They seek to provide communities with coastal protection from storms, erosion, and/or flooding while also providing some of the other natural benefits that restored habitats provide. Yet there remain many unknowns about how to design and implement these projects. This study examines three innovative coastal resilience projects that use NNBF approaches to improve coastal community resilience to flooding while providing a host of other benefits: 1) Living Breakwaters in New York Harbor; 2) the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Study; and 3) the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project in San Francisco Bay. We synthesize findings from these case studies to report areas of progress and illustrate remaining challenges. All three case studies began with innovative project funding and framing that enabled expansion beyond a sole focus on flood risk reduction to include multiple functions and benefits. Each project involved stakeholder engagement and incorporated feedback into the design process. In the Texas case study this dramatically shifted one part of the project design from a more traditional, gray approach to a more natural hybrid solution. We also identified common challenges related to permitting and funding, which often arise as a consequence of uncertainties in performance and long-term sustainability for diverse NNBF approaches. The Living Breakwaters project is helping to address these uncertainties by using detailed computational and physical modeling and a variety of experimental morphologies to help facilitate learning while monitoring future performance. This paper informs and improves future sustainable coastal resilience projects by learning from these past innovations, highlighting the need for integrated and robust monitoring plans for projects after implementation, and emphasizing the critical role of stakeholder engagement.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>China is rich in oyster resources and has a long history of oyster aquaculture. Various forms of oyster aquaculture coexist in the coastal regions of China, which are dominated by raft aquaculture and long-line aquaculture. The objective of this study is to assess the environmental sustainability of the oyster aquaculture systems located in Jiantiao Bay, Zhejiang province, China. Emergy synthesis is used in the study to quantify the contributions of the natural and economic inputs to the oyster aquaculture systems, in order to better understand the sustainability. The results show that the raft oyster aquaculture system was high in emergy inputs and yield per unit area, whereas the long-line oyster aquaculture system was low in emergy inputs and yield per unit area. However, the transformities of the oysters from the raft oyster aquaculture system and the long-line aquaculture were similar, reflecting that both systems had a similar efficiency in using natural and economic resources. The oyster aquaculture systems had a different impact on the environment as inferred from the emergy indicators. The higher emergy yield ratio and low emergy loading ratio in the long-line oyster aquaculture system suggest that the system could gain more net benefit, and had a lower impact on the surrounding environment, than raft oyster aquaculture system, and can been considered to be more sustainable. Nevertheless, oyster aquaculture was a labor-intensive process and relied highly on purchased resources, such as labor and construction materials. If the construction materials could be used for a longer time, the oyster aquaculture systems might be more sustainable and environmentally friendly.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Biscayne Bay is an urban bay in Southeast Florida, but the southern region of the Bay is dominated by mangroves. Mangrove wetlands provide important habitat for fish, but some regions are altered by drainage canals in southern Biscayne Bay. This study utilized a large public dataset to determine if fish formed distinct species assemblages throughout Biscayne Bay by examining fish surveyed at 12 different sites over 5 years. Six sites were in front of intact mangrove shorelines, while the other six sites were adjacent to mangrove sites altered by drainage canals or residential marinas. Cluster analyses revealed that fish did form distinct species assemblage clusters which were correlated with salinity and depth. Mangrove shoreline type (intact vs. canal-altered) and geographic location did not appear to affect species composition or diversity in fish assemblages across Southern Biscayne Bay.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Barrier islands within sheltered environments are an important natural defense from severe storm impacts for coastal communities worldwide. Despite their importance, these fetch-limited barrier islands remain understudied and their ability to withstand and recover from storms is not well-understood. Here, we present a case study of Sugarloaf Island in North Carolina that demonstrates the operational use of openly accessible LiDAR and aerial imagery data to quantify synoptic habitat, shoreline, and volumetric change between 2014 and 2020, a period that encompasses four hurricanes and a winter storm event. During this time period, our results show: (1) an 11–13% decrease in marsh and shrub habitat, (2) an average landward shoreline migration of 2.9 m yr−1 and up to 5.2 m yr−1 in extreme areas, and (3) a net volume loss of approximately 9800 m3. The results of this study highlight the importance of storms as a driver of morphologic change on Sugarloaf Island and have implications for better understanding the resiliency of fetch-limited barrier islands to storms. This work helps to enhance prerestoration data availability and supports knowledge-based decision-making regarding habitat change, erosional issues, and the efficacy of nature-based solutions to increase the resiliency of a coastal community in North Carolina.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>As coastal communities grow more vulnerable to sea-level rise and increased storminess, communities have turned to nature-based solutions to bolster coastal resilience and protection. Marshes have significant wave attenuation properties and can play an important role in coastal protection for many communities. Many restoration projects seek to maximize this ecosystem service but how much marsh restoration is enough to deliver measurable coastal protection benefits is still unknown. This question is critical to guiding assessments of cost effectiveness and for funding, implementation, and optimizing of marsh restoration for risk reduction projects. This study uses SWAN model simulations to determine empirical relationships between wave attenuation and marsh vegetation. The model runs consider several different common marsh morphologies (including systems with channels, ponds, and fringing mudflats), vegetation placement, and simulated storm intensity. Up to a 95% reduction in wave energy is seen at as low as 50% vegetation cover. Although these empirical relationships between vegetative cover and wave attenuation provide essential insight for marsh restoration, it is also important to factor in lifespan estimates of restored marshes when making overall restoration decisions. The results of this study are important for coastal practitioners and managers seeking performance goals and metrics for marsh restoration, enhancement, and creation.</jats:p>

Meanwhile, they play a significant role in improving ocean ecology and accelerating the evolution of fishery industries. Since they are generally affected by currents, waves, and other hydrological factors, the flow field around artificial reefs and their stabilities have become a research hotspot in recent years. Research on artificial reefs is a systematic process consisting of four aspects: Firstly, the significance, the definition, the mechanism, and the present research progress were introduced for artificial reefs in detail. Secondly, the development trend of the sit-bottom artificial reef and that of the floating artificial reef were summarized, respectively. Thirdly, it was found that the combination of traditional artificial reefs and emerging ocean engineering has a great development potential in practical engineering. Finally, the existing problems related to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the artificial reefs in China were summarized, and the prospects of artificial reefs were proposed. The purpose of this study is to provide a scientific reference for the ecological and sustainable development of the large-scale construction of artificial reefs in the ocean.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. The increasing vulnerability of coastal megacities to storm surge inundation means both infrastructure and populations are subject to significant threat. Planning for further urban development should include consideration of the changing circumstances in coastal cities to ensure a sustainable future. A sustainable urban plan relies on sound preparedness and prediction of future climate change and multiple natural hazards. In light of these needs for urban planning, this paper develops a general method to simulate typhoon-generated storm surge at the mesoscale (1–100 km in length). Mesoscale simulation provides a general approach with reasonable accuracy that could be implemented for planning purposes while having a relatively low computation resource requirement. The case study of Shanghai was chosen to implement this method. The mesoscale simulations of two historical typhoons not only provides realistic typhoon storm surge inundation results at the city level but is also suitable for implementing a large amount of simulations for future scenario studies. The method will be generally applicable to all coastal cities around the world to examine the effect of future climate change on typhoon-generated storm surge even when historical observation data are inadequate or not available. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Recent studies have drawn special attention to the significant dependencies between flood drivers and the occurrence of compound flood events in coastal areas. This study investigates compound flooding from tides, river discharge (Q), and specifically waves using a hydrodynamic model at the Breede Estuary, South Africa. We quantify vertical and horizontal differences in flood characteristics caused by driver interaction and assess the contribution of waves. Therefore, we compare flood characteristics resulting from compound flood scenarios to those in which single drivers are omitted. We find that flood characteristics are more sensitive to Q than to waves, particularly when the latter only coincides with high spring tides. When interacting with Q, however, the contribution of waves is high, causing 10 %–12 % larger flood extents and 45–85 cm higher water depths, as waves caused backwater effects and raised water levels inside the lower reaches of the estuary. With higher wave intensity, the first flooding began up to 12 h earlier. Our findings provide insights on compound flooding in terms of flood magnitude and timing at a South African estuary and demonstrate the need to account for the effects of compound events, including waves, in future flood impact assessments of open South African estuaries. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Nature-based solutions are increasingly suggested for mitigating coastal flood risks in the face of climate change. Managed realignment (MR), a coastal adaptation strategy that entails the landward realignment of coastal defences to restore coastal habitats (often salt marshes), plays a pivotal role in implementing nature-based solutions in the coastal zone. Across Europe, more than 130 sites have been implemented so far, often to harness their potential to mitigate coastal flood risks while restoring coastal habitats (ABPmer, 2021). However, local communities often oppose MR projects, not only because they are seen as returning hard-won land to the sea but also because their coastal protection function is less trusted than traditional hard engineering techniques. This scepticism has foundation. The proclaimed coastal protection function of MRs is based on a broad body of literature on the protective function of natural salt marshes. However, contrary to natural salt marshes, MRs are often semi-enclosed tidal basins with narrow breaches to the open sea/estuary. Recent studies indicate that MR-internal hydrodynamics may significantly reduce their coastal protection, depending on their engineering design. To successfully implement MR, a much-improved scientific knowledge base is needed, as well as a process for addressing community concerns and genuinely engaging stakeholders in decision-making beyond the usual obligatory consultancy approach. Here, we propose the co-production of scientific knowledge with local communities and stakeholders to optimize the success of coastal nature-based solutions and promote community acceptance. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Coastal mangroves, thriving at the interface between land and sea, provide robust flood risk reduction. Projected increases in the frequency and magnitude of climate impact drivers such as sea level rise and wind and wave climatology reinforce the need to optimize the design and functionality of coastal protection works to increase resilience. Doing so effectively requires a sound understanding of the local coastal system. However, data availability particularly at muddy coasts remains a pronounced problem. As such, this paper captures a unique dataset for the Guyana coastline and focuses on relations between vegetation (mangrove) density, wave attenuation rates and sediment characteristics. These processes were studied along a cross-shore transect with mangroves fringing the coastline of Guyana. The data are publicly available at the 4TU Centre for Research Data (4TU.ResearchData) via https://doi.org/10.4121/c.5715269 (Best et al., 2022) where the collection Advancing Resilience Measures for Vegetated Coastline (ARM4VEG), Guyana, comprises of six key datasets. Suspended sediment concentrations typically exceeded 1 g L−1 with a maximum of 60 g L−1, implying that we measured merely fluid-mud conditions across a 1 m depth. Time series of wind waves and fluid-mud density variations, recorded simultaneously with tide elevation and suspended sediment data, indicate that wave–fluid-mud interactions in the nearshore may be largely responsible for the accumulation of fine, muddy sediment along the coast. Sediment properties reveal a consolidated underlying bed layer. Vegetation coverage densities in the Avicennia-dominated forest were determined across the vertical with maximum values over the first 20 cm from the bed due to the roots and pneumatophores. Generalized total wave attenuation rates in the forest and along the mudflat were between 0.002–0.0032 m−1 and 0.0003–0.0004 m−1 respectively. Both the mangroves and the mudflats have a high wave-damping capacity. The wave attenuation in the mangroves is presumably dominated by energy losses due to vegetation drag, since wave attenuation due to bottom friction and viscous dissipation on the bare mudflats is significantly lower than wave dissipation inside the mangrove vegetation. Data collected corroborate the coastal defence function of mangroves by quantifying their contribution to wave attenuation and sediment trapping. The explicit linking of these properties to vegetation structure facilitates modelling studies investigating the mechanisms determining the coastal defence capacities of mangroves. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Coastal lowlands and estuaries are subjected to increasing flood risks during storm surges due to global and regional changes. Tidal wetlands are increasingly valued as effective natural buffers for storm surges by dissipating wave energy and providing flood water storage. While previous studies focused on flood wave attenuation within and behind wetlands, this study focuses on the effects of estuarine wetland properties on the attenuation of a storm tide that propagates along the length of an estuary. Wetland properties including elevation, surface area, and location within the estuary were investigated using a numerical model of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, SW Netherlands). For a spring tide lower wetland elevations result in more attenuation of high water levels along the estuary, while for a higher storm tide higher elevations provide more attenuation compared to lower wetland elevations. For spring and storm tide a arger wetland surface area results in a better attenuation along the estuary up to a threshold wetland size for which larger wetlands do not further contribute to more attenuation. Finally a wetland of the same size and elevation, but located more upstream in the estuary, can store a larger proportion of the local flood volume and therefore has a larger attenuating effect on upstream high water levels. With this paper we aim to contribute towards a better understanding and wider implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation to increasing estuarine flood risks associated with storms. </jats:p>

AB  - • We evaluated the role of mussels in enhancing coastal water quality. • The study took place in False Bay, Southern Africa’s largest natural bay. • Most environmental indicators showed a 2-way gradient: onshore-offshore, west-east. • Pollution inputs were mainly detected on one side of the bay. • Coastal circulation and intertidal filter feeders mitigated anthropogenic inputs. Nearshore water quality can be highly impacted by anthropogenic activities ongoing along the coast, the effects of which on natural environments can be permanent and irreversible, with consequences for ecosystem biodiversity and functioning, as well as for associated services. Benthic filter feeders (e.g., mussels) provide several services for coastal regions, including improving water quality by reducing eutrophication, being a major source of food for humans, and as a habitat-forming species. Here, we seek to understand the role of benthic filter feeders in enhancing water quality in an urban coastal system in order to assess their role as ecosystem service providers and how they should be included in ecosystem-based evaluations. Using as a model False Bay, South Africa’s largest natural bay and a socio-economic hotspot, this multidisciplinary study was designed to identify possible pollution sources to a highly-urbanised coastal region, assess their effects on several biological and biogeochemical parameters, and evaluate the role of mussels in mitigating these anthropogenic inputs. We consider several sources of pollution, including nutrient loading from wastewater and river outflows, heavy metals, and aerosol deposition. We find that pollutant inputs are largely attenuated by the circulation of the bay and by the presence of filter feeders that bioaccumulate contaminants, thereby removing them from coastal waters. Our work thus emphasizes the potential for mussels and natural abiotic processes to ameliorate anthropogenic impacts, although these mitigation strategies are not without environmental risk. We recommend that such information should be included in national assessments used to develop appropriate strategies and policies for coastal environmental management and conservation.

AB  - • Railways urgently need to adapt to the impacts of climate change. • NbS are presented as potential alternatives to current grey engineered adaptation options. • Very few studies have investigated the role of NbS in rail. • Five examples of the application of NbS in live rail environments were found globally. • An argument for further research into the use of NbS in rail is presented. The transport sector fulfils crucial economic and social functions with railways being instrumental in the safe, efficient, and reliable movements of people to their destinations and goods to market. One of the most critical vulnerabilities in the railway transport system is the low flexibility of both infrastructure and operations in the event of disturbances including those caused by extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, storm surges and temperature extremes. With the frequency and intensity of such events being projected to increase, the failure to proactively consider the impacts of a changing climate on new and existing infrastructure raises the possibility of increased service disruption and adverse economic impacts as climate change progresses. Nature-based solutions (NbS) present long-lasting, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable climate change adaptation (CCA) options. However, as an effective alternative or complement to grey (engineered) solutions, they are still in their infancy, especially within the railway sector. To date very few studies have investigated the role of NbS for CCA in the railway transport system. Recognizing the importance of the rail industry's need to adapt its infrastructure to accommodate current weather extremes and a changing climate, this review paper examines NbS being used as CCA measures both in the rail context, and in non-rail contexts which may be transferable to the rail sector. Our review demonstrates that there are significant knowledge gaps that may hinder the uptake of NbS in the rail environment which warrant further research to support the inclusion of NbS as viable CCA options for rail infrastructure. Better understanding of these issues is required for the development of rail sector specific guidance and will enable better design, implementation, and dissemination of NbS as credible alternatives or complements, and more sustainable CCA measures.

AB  - • Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of marine habitats is full of potential. • There is therefore a growing demand for automated analysis of marine PAM data. • Automated ecoacoustic indices are frequently used but have shown mixed success. • We show that combining multiple indices using machine learning improves analysis. • We demonstrate the application of this to track coral reef restoration. Historically, ecological monitoring of marine habitats has primarily relied on labour-intensive, non-automated survey methods. The field of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has demonstrated the potential of this practice to automate surveying in marine habitats. This has primarily been through the use of ‘ecoacoustic indices’ to quantify attributes from natural soundscapes. However, investigations using individual indices have had mixed success. Using PAM recordings collected at one of the world’s largest coral reef restoration programmes, we instead apply a machine-learning approach across a suite of ecoacoustic indices to improve predictive power of ecosystem health. Healthy and degraded reef sites were identified through live coral cover surveys, with 90–95% and 0–20% cover respectively. A library of one-minute recordings were extracted from each. Twelve ecoacoustic indices were calculated for each recording, in up to three different frequency bandwidths (low: 0.05–0.8 kHz, medium: 2–7 kHz and broad: 0.05–20 kHz). Twelve of these 33 index-frequency combinations differed significantly between healthy and degraded habitats. However, the best performing single index could only correctly classify 47% of recordings, requiring extensive sampling from each site to be useful. We therefore trained a regularised discriminant analysis machine-learning algorithm to discriminate between healthy and degraded sites using an optimised combination of ecoacoustic indices. This multi-index approach discriminated between these two habitat classes with improved accuracy compared to any single index in isolation. The pooled classification rate of 1000 cross-validated iterations of the model had a 91.7% 0.8, mean SE) success rate at correctly classifying individual recordings. The model was subsequently used to classify recordings from two actively restored sites, established >24 months prior to recordings, with coral cover values of 79.1% (±3.9) and 66.5% (±3.8). Of these recordings, 37/38 and 33/39 received a classification as healthy respectively. The model was also used to classify recordings from a newly restored site established <12 months prior with a coral cover of 25.6% (±2.6), from which 27/33 recordings were classified as degraded. This investigation highlights the value of combining PAM recordings with machine-learning analysis for ecological monitoring and demonstrates the potential of PAM to monitor reef recovery over time, reducing the reliance on labour-intensive in-water surveys by experts. As access to PAM recorders continues to rapidly advance, effective automated analysis will be needed to keep pace with these expanding acoustic datasets.

AB  -: The purpose of this CHETN is to examine storm surge and wave reduction benefits of marsh restoration, as well as the impact of future wetland degradation on local surge and wave conditions. Storm surge simulations of representative moderate and severe hurricanes were performed using the ADCIRC storm surge model, with the inclusion of radiation stress gradients from the STWAVE nearshore wave model. Coupled model simulations were made for wetland landscape configurations in south Louisiana that involved hypothetical restored and degraded wetland features. This is the first in a series of tech notes on the influence of marshes on storm surge and waves.
