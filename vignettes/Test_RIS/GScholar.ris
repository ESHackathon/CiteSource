AB  - Worldwide, communities are facing increasing flood risk, due to more frequent and intense hazards and rising exposure through more people living along coastlines and in flood plains. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), such as mangroves, and riparian forests, offer huge potential for adaptation and risk reduction. The capacity of trees and forests to attenuate waves and mitigate storm damages receives massive attention, especially after extreme storm events. However, application of forests in flood mitigation strategies remains limited to date, due to lack of real-scale measurements on the performance under extreme conditions. Experiments executed in a large-scale flume with a willow forest to dissipate waves show that trees are hardly damaged and strongly reduce wave and run-up heights, even when maximum wave heights are up to 2.5 m. It was observed for the first time that the surface area of the tree canopy is most relevant for wave attenuation and that the very flexible leaves limitedly add to effectiveness. Overall, the study shows that forests can play a significant role in reducing wave heights and run-up under extreme conditions. Currently, this potential is hardly used but may offer future benefits in achieving more adaptive levee designs.

AB  - Worldwide, climate change adaptation in coastal areas is a growing challenge. The most common solutions such as seawalls and breakwaters are expensive and often lead to unexpected disastrous effects on the neighboring unprotected areas. In recent years, this awareness has guided coastal managers to adopt alternative solutions with lower environmental impact to protect coastal areas, defined as Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs). NBS are quite popular around the world but are often analyzed and implemented individually at pilot sites. This contribution analyzes the effectiveness of two NBS to mitigate coastal impacts (coastal flooding and erosion) under three historical storms along the Emilia-Romagna coasts and the induced improvements due to their potential integration. Through numerical simulations with XBeach, this study demonstrated that the presence of seagrass meadows of Zostera marina produces an average attenuation of 32 % of the storm peak with a maximum attenuation of 89 % in incoming wave height. Seagrass also mitigates flooded areas and maximum inundation depths by 37 % and 58 % respectively. The artificial dune leads to higher mitigation in terms of inundation of the lagoon (up to 75 %), also avoiding any morphological variations behind it. Seagrass has also been shown to be able to reduce beach erosion volumes up to 55 %. The synergic effect of the two NBS improves the capacity to mitigate both inundation (with a benefit of up to 77 % for flooded area attenuation with respect to cases without any defenses) and coastal erosion. Results of the study suggest that the two NBS will work together to produce co-benefits in terms of preservation of their efficiency, development of habitats for organisms and vegetation species, and thereby offering an important social value in terms of possible tourism, recreation and research.

AB  - Working to update the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report from 2017 titled “Law, Policy, and Governance of Mangroves in Small Island Developing States” revealed that mangroves are not only important to these small island nations, but to all members of the global community with coastlines. When governments choose to invest in mangrove related projects they are essentially targeting Sustainable Development Goals 13, 14, and 15: climate action, life below water, and life on land. The client for this project, the Nicholas Institute was interested in further understanding the ways in which non-government actors were contributing to funds for mangrove related projects.

AB  - Wooden fences are applied as a nature-based solution to support mangrove restoration along mangrove coasts in general and the Mekong Delta coast in particular. The simple structure uses vertical bamboo poles as a frame to store horizontal bamboo and tree branches (brushwood). Fence resistance is quantitatively determined by the drag coefficient exerted by the fence material on the flow; however, the behaviour of drag is predictable only when the arrangement of the cylinders is homogeneous. Therefore, for more arbitrary arrangements, the Darcy–Forchheimer equations need to be considered. In this study, the law of fluid flow was applied by forcing a constant flow of water through the fence material and measuring the loss of hydraulic pressure over a fence thickness. Fences, mainly using bamboo sticks, were installed with model-scale and full-scale diameters applying two main arrangements, inhomogeneous and staggered. Our empirical findings led to several conclusions. The bulk drag coefficient (CD¯¯¯¯¯ ) is influenced by the flow regime represented by Reynolds number. The drag coefficient decreases with the increase of the porosity, which strongly depends on fence arrangements. Finally, the Forchheimer coefficients can be linked to the drag coefficient through a related porosity parameter at high turbulent conditions. The staggered arrangement is well-predicted by the Ergun-relations for the Darcy–Forchheimer coefficients when an inhomogeneous arrangement with equal porosity and diameter leads to a large drag and flow resistance.

AB  - Without action, global impacts from natural hazards are expected to increase in frequency and severity due to climate change and concurrent ecological and social crises. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are sustainable approaches to disaster risk reduction (DRR) that provide multiple additional benefits for nature and to a range of stakeholders. NbS contrast with ‘grey’ infrastructure measures, which rely on non-natural materials, generally aim to address a single issue, and have fewer societal co-benefits. NbS are generally conceptualized as ‘green’ measures, although ‘hybrid’ measures (combining green and grey) are also NbS. DRR measures often rely on public and community buy-in for their success, but NbS amplify this reliance with their emphasis on co-creation, -implementation, and -monitoring. Public acceptance is therefore directly linked to the ability of NbS to provide benefits, including DRR. Although NbS research increasingly focuses on barriers to its uptake, there is a lack of research on public acceptance of local residents in NbS ‘host communities’. Instead, it is often taken for granted that current high levels of public acceptance of NbS at European scale will be replicated at local levels and maintained over time. Additionally, there is a lack of past research that compares perceptions of NbS and grey measures, explores a broad range of factors that may influence public acceptance, and determines preferences across the full green-hybrid-grey spectrum. This research, conducted within the Horizon 2020 OPERANDUM project, aims to determine factors that contribute to positive or negative attitudes and behaviours towards NbS for DRR. A systematic literature review was carried out, followed by citizen surveys and focus groups at planned European NbS sites. Surveys were conducted in Scotland (landslides; n=66 respondents), Finland (lake eutrophication; n=204) and Greece (flooding; n=84), followed by in-depth focus groups (n=4) at the Scotland site. Results from the three methods noted above show generally high public acceptance, but also consistently highlight scepticism regarding NbS effectiveness for DRR and uncertainty surrounding the approach as barriers to acceptance. Dozens of factors that can influence acceptance were identified and, despite variation in the strength of factors across study sites, several consistencies emerged. For example, public trust in implementers was important for positive attitudes towards the NbS, while perceptions of place were important for pro-NbS behaviour (i.e., engagement). Cultural ecosystem services, and especially aesthetic value, were highlighted as crucial determinants of acceptance throughout. However, in the Scotland site, the effectiveness of the NbS for reducing risk was paramount and therefore the perceived limitations of NbS drove preferences towards greyer (i.e., more hybrid) measures. This thesis emphasises a need for more focus on the importance of meeting public expectations for risk reduction, providing cultural ecosystem services as co-benefits, centering people-place relations in NbS work, and considering the efficacy and support of hybrid rather than purely green options. Additionally, the Public Acceptance of NbS framework [PA-NbS] is introduced in the review as a starting point for NbS researchers and practitioners to systematise their consideration of public acceptance and how it can be increased. It includes overarching recommendations: provide benefits, increase awareness of benefits, communicate effectively, and promote participation. Each recommendation has four corresponding success criteria which, through the subsequent analyses, are tailored to both the specific contexts of the study sites and for NbS projects globally. Using interdisciplinary concepts and a mixed-methods approach, this research takes a critical perspective with the practice-oriented aim of improving the sustainable success of NbS for DRR. With this, further research is called for to better understand public expectations of NbS, how best to frame NbS and their (c -)benefits to different stakeholders, and how acceptance may change through time based on evidence of NbS performance.

AB  - With the emergence of the so-called Blue Economy, various conservation finance mechanisms and financial structures are being proposed as a means of simultaneously securing marine biodiversity and profit-making. A novel approach that is being applied within this new conservation finance frontier is the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance. By synthesizing recent literatures in political ecology on the notion of rent and the biopolitics of nature, this article explores how the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance can be seen as a technique that is mobilized for governing ecosystem rents biopolitically. The article urges political ecologists to pay attention to how biopolitics and governance of rents intersect in market-based environmental governance. While surveying the breadth of projects that involves both adaptation and insurance, I pay particular attention to a parametric coral reef insurance that was recently introduced in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. Such a project, this article argues, involves reconceptualizing the coral reef as an infrastructure that provides benefits – ultimately rents – to the local tourist industry and indirectly the state, but this coral infrastructure is itself in need of being protected through insurance as a biopolitical measure that can ensure the future life of the coral reef by rendering calculable uncertain, future climate threats to the reef. By reconceptualizing ecosystems as infrastructure that can be insured, the notion of ecosystem-based adaptation operationalizes otherwise systematic risks posed by climate change and biodiversity loss on a local scale. Finally, I highlight some of the complications that are involved when insurance is used as a biopolitical means of making nature live.

AB  - With the aim of better understand and parameterize the physical processes involved in flow-mangrove interaction, wave attenuation and drag forces along a 1:6 scale fringe Rhizophora mangrove forest are studied experimentally. The 26 m long forest is composed by 135 models built reproducing mature Rhizophora mangrove trees with 24 prop roots. Hydrodynamic conditions are scaled using Froude similarity based on values collected in nature. Regular and random waves are tested and three water depths are considered to account for the influence of variable mangroves frontal area along the vertical. Wave decay analysis highlights the importance of considering the effect of flume bottom and walls friction. Neglecting this additional damping can result in a high overestimation of the mangrove dissipation capacity. It is proven that water depth, and the associated mangroves frontal area, and wave height are the dominant variables driving wave attenuation for short waves. The slope seaward the forest induces wave shoaling leading to an increase of wave steepness. Accordingly, the exerted forces on the mangroves also increase along the first 3–4 m of the forest. Smaller forces are recorded further into the forest where wave decay formulations fit well to the recorded wave heights. In general, analytical drag forces obtained by using mangrove trees induced damping coefficients compare well to the forces measured within the forest. However, analytical drag forces can lead to overestimations of up to double in some cases. This aspect is very important when experimental results are used to feed numerical or analytical models based on the introduction of a drag force in the momentum equation. These models should be calibrated using, whenever possible, direct force measurements.

AB  - With the acceleration of climate change impacts, adaptation is no longer a matter of choice for most communities. There has been a growing interest in coastal green infrastructure (CGI), natural and nature-based adaptation measures, due to its role in flood and erosion protection, and provision of multiple environmental, social and economic benefits. However, there remains a gap in understanding the context-dependency of CGI as an adaptation measure. In this dissertation, I empirically investigate the environmental, local and institutional contexts in which CGI can be used as a sea level rise adaptation measure through three distinct studies, focusing on the coastal regions of British Columbia (BC) and Washington State (WA). First, I conduct a regional study. Using climatic and environment indicators, I investigate where CGI has the highest coastal protection potential while taking into account its vulnerability. I conclude that CGI in the large population centers in BC and most of the communities in WA may not provide high coastal protection benefits, where CGI in the smaller communities have a higher potential. Second, I undertake a local study in BC, investigating community trade-offs between CGI and other adaptation strategies. I incorporate local perspectives to develop adaptation scenarios and create an evaluation framework using the literature and expert inputs. Applying the framework to the scenarios, I conclude that there are important trade-offs between the local implications of different strategies. I find that the CGI scenario had the highest positive impacts, but displayed institutional drawbacks compared to others. Third, I undertake an institutional study comparing the barriers to and facilitators of CGI implementation in BC and WA. I conclude that besides barriers and facilitators common to adaptation, factors specific to CGI, such as coastal jurisdiction and ownership; financial variation and flexibility; vision; organization efficiency and access to resources; partnerships and collaborations; NGOs; and community advocacy are also influential. Ultimately, this dissertation concludes that CGI’s context dependency influence its potential benefits, its applicability as a local adaptation measure, and implementation within the existing institutional arrangements. Considering contextual factors can support more successful implementation of CGI, and therefore can increase adaptation to sea level rise.

AB  - With rising seas come several challenges for our coastlines, including the need to maintain waterways, ports, and harbors; military and infrastructure resiliency; and the protection of valuable coastal ecosystems. This technical note examines coastal resiliency needs and challenges along America’s four coasts – Great Lakes, East, Gulf and West coasts, with a review of select case studies. Latest tools for resiliency and adaptation planning are reviewed and presented. Undoubtedly, there is a need for regulation to promote beneficial use of dredged sediments to improve coastal resiliency, including, but not limited to, aligning navigational dredging schedules with coastal protection needs. Permitting of these projects can be challenging as projects are typically reviewed by regulatory agencies as “disposal” or “placement” projects, as opposed to ecosystem restoration projects, which provide a distinct ecological uplift benefit. Quantification of benefits resulting from resiliency projects continues to be an area that needs more analytical tools and project data. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions, including areas of additional research, and data gaps.

AB  - With increasing storminess and incessant sea-level rise, coastal erosion is becoming a primary issue along many littorals in the world. To cope with present and future climate change scenarios, it is important to map the shoreline position over years and assess the coastal erosion trends to select the best risk management solutions and guarantee a sustainable management of communities, structures, and ecosystems. However, this objective is particularly challenging on gentle-sloping sandy coasts, where also small sea-level changes trigger significant morphological evolutions. This study presents a multidisciplinary study combining satellite images with Machine Learning and GIS-based spatial tools to analyze short-term shoreline evolution trends and detect erosion hot-spots on the Venice coast over the period 2015–2019. Firstly, advanced image preprocessing, which is not frequently adopted in coastal erosion studies, was performed on satellite images downloaded within the same tidal range. Secondly, different Machine Learning classification methods were tested to accurately define shoreline position by recognizing the land-sea interface in each image. Finally, the application of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System tool was performed to evaluate and visualize coastal changes over the years. Overall, the case study littoral reveals to be stable or mainly subjected to accretion. This is probably due to the high presence of coastal protection structures that stabilize the beaches, enhancing deposition processes. In detail, with respect to the total length of the considered shoreline (about 83 km), 5 % of the coast is eroding, 36 % is stable, 52 % is accreting and 7 % is not evaluable. Despite a significant coastal erosion risk was not recognized within this region, well-delimited erosion hot-spots were mapped in correspondence of Caorle, Jesolo and Cavallino-Treporti municipalities. These areas deserve higher attention for territorial planning and prioritization of adaptation measures, facing climate change scenarios and sea-level rise emergencies in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management.

AB  - With climate change and rising sea levels, the coastal zone’s flood risk is deteriorating. Previous researches have shown a gradually degrading capacity of traditional hard engineering structures (e.g., seawall, dikes) on flood mitigation due to problems such as land subsidence and insufficient maintenance. To remedy the defects, the “building with nature concept” for coastal protection with saltmarshes was examined by combining field measurements and numerical simulations. The advantages of saltmarsh over traditional seawall on flood protection was demonstrated from the perspective of both flood area mitigation and economic gain, based on scenario simulations. Results show that tidal wetlands are essential in mitigating significant wave heights (Hs) and current velocities even during storm conditions. The storm wave and current velocity reduction ratio (RRw and RRc) by saltmarshes on Chongming Dongtan Shoal (CMDS) during Typhoon 9711 is approximately 11% and 51%, respectively. The wave and current mitigation by Scirpus mariqueter are more efficient than Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis during measurements in 2010, which were approximately 0.3 m and 0.2 m/s, 0.125 m and 0.155 m/s, 0.086 m and 0.128 m/s per kilometer width, respectively. The summer saltmarsh area 54.2 km2 on CMDS protects approximately 32 km2 land area behind the seawall from being flooded, equivalent to the seawall heightening of approximately 0.42 m on equivalent flood mitigation. The performance of cost-and-benefit analysis shows a relatively higher (by 3%–7%) net present value (NPV) and a higher (by 1.5 times) benefit-cost ratio (BC) of nature-based solution (i.e., saltmarsh restoration) compared with traditional hard engineering solution (i.e., seawall construction). Thus, building seawall with nature, such as a hybrid flood protection measure, should be implemented in the future coastal redesign and maintenance.

AB  - With around 85% of Australia’s population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels and increasing storm surges will continue to have significant impacts on many of the continent’s coastal communities and landscapes. This presents great challenges to urban planners, urban designers and landscape architects responsible for creating safe, functional, and robust built environments for coastal communities. In preparation for sustainable adaptation to sea-level rise, nature-based solutions and soft ecosystem-driven approaches are increasingly considered at the micro scale of design, but less explored at the planning level. This research investigates the integration of nature-based solutions (NBS) at the planning level for a proposed development project in the coastal city of Geelong, south-west of Melbourne, Victoria. We examine whether the draft strategic plan for the redevelopment of Point Henry-Moolap coastal area in Geelong, incorporates principles of nature-based approaches to address projected impacts of coastal climate change. A brief review of coastal management policies in Victoria is provided. An analysis framework derived from NBS principles is used to identify concepts within the development framework plan that are aligned with NBS and ecosystems-based approaches. From the analysis, areas that provide opportunities for a better integration of NBS in coastal planning and responding to future climate-induced impacts are identified. We conclude that providing clearer directions, including regulatory instruments in high level land use planning, can help local governments and developers make informed decisions that consider human well-being, biodiversity and climate change. With Australia’s global premises of coastal population growth, and increasing impacts of climate change on coastal areas, this research provides a timely contribution aligned with current social and ecological challenges.

AB  - Why ecosystem undervaluation is a problem Even though the concept of ‘green infrastructure’ has gained currency over recent years, it still tends to be accorded a low priority as compared to more conventional ‘grey’ measures. One important reason is the lack of demonstrable evidence as to how and why ecosystems offer an economically worthwhile investment choice. For the most part, calculations of the relative returns to different land, resource and investment choices simply do not factor in ecosystem costs and benefits. Given these informational and methodological gaps, it is perhaps hardly surprising that both public and private sector planners often remain unconvinced — or even unaware — about the potential to harness the natural environment to deliver key infrastructure and development services.

AB  - While mangroves are increasingly described as social-ecological systems (SESs), performing SES research is so much more than merely documenting local resource utilisation patterns in case studies. The aim of this paper is to review and show how ecological, human and institutional resilience could be understood and fostered in an era of uncertainty, through the adaptive cycle (AC) heuristic. Uncertainties come in many forms and shapes: climate change, social and economic dynamics, natural disasters, political and institutional disruption and ever-increasing public demands for participation. Social-ecological studies form windows of experimentation that can provide insights beyond their case-specific context. In order to synthesise and structure the cumulative knowledge base arising from existing and future studies, the need for a suitable overarching framework arose. Here, the AC heuristic represents the connectedness between variables of the mangrove SES versus the mangrove's accumulated capital (natural, built, human and social). We posit that the AC heuristic can be used to interpret spatial and temporal changes (ecological, social, economic, political) in mangrove SESs and we exemplify it by using the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as well as a century-long silviculture case. The AC, combined with the SES scheme, allows integration of the spato-temporal dynamics and the multi-dimensional character of mangrove SESs. We also reviewed the ecosystem functions, services and disservices of mangrove SESs, linking each of them to SES capital and variable (fast or slow) attributes, which in turn are closely linked to the different axes and phases of the AC. We call upon mangrove scientists from the natural, applied, social and human sciences to join forces in fitting diversified empirical data from multiple case studies around the world to the AC heuristic. The aim is to reflect on and understand such complex dynamic systems with stakeholders having various (mutual) relationships at risk of breaking down, and to prepare for interactive adaptive planning for mangrove forests.

AB  - While land reclaimed from the sea meets the land demand for coastal development, it simultaneously causes socio-economic systems to be prone to coastal flooding induced by storm surges and sea-level rise. Current studies have seldom linked reclamation with coastal flood impact assessment, hindering the provision of accurate information to support coastal flood risk management and adaptation. This study, using Xiamen, China as a case study, incorporates the spatiotemporal dynamics of reclamation into a coastal flood impact model, in order to investigate the long-term influence of reclamation activities on coastal flood inundation and the consequent exposure of the population to coastal flooding. We find that rapid population growth, continual economic development and urbanization drive a substantial logarithmic increase in coastal reclamation. Historical and future expansions of seaward land reclamation are found to cause dramatic surges in the expected annual inundation (EAI) and the expected annual population (EAP) exposed to coastal flooding. In Xiamen, EAI is estimated to increase by 440.2% from 1947 to 2035, owing to continuing land reclamation. Consequently, the population living in the flooded area has also increased sharply: the EAP of total population is estimated to rise from 0.8% in 1947 to 4.7% in 2035, where reclamation contributes over 80% of this increase. Moreover, a future 10 cm sea-level rise in 2035 will lead to extra 5.73% and 8.15% increases in EAI and EAP, respectively, and is expected to cause massive permanent submersion in the new reclamation zone. Our findings emphasize an integration of hard structures and nature-based solutions for building resilient coasts.

AB  - While in very rare cases, relict mangrove forests can reflect past sea-level and develop far inland (up to 170 km according to Aburto-Oropeza et al.), mangrove trees and shrubs generally grow along tropical and subtropical coasts, inhabiting the mid and upper intertidal zones of soft sediment shores. They can form dense and extensive monospecific stands or multi-species assemblages, covering sheltered coastlines, bays and lagoons, or estuaries. The global distribution of mangrove forests ranges from approximately 30° N to approximately 30° S – except for the west coast of Africa and South America and the south coast of Australia, where the distribution limit coincides with the 20°C isotherm of sea surface water. Some 65 “true mangrove” species (plant species which only occur in mangrove environments, as opposed to “mangrove associates”, which can occur in mangrove forests but also in other terrestrial or aquatic habitats) are known from the Indo-West Pacific region; the Atlantic-East Pacific region is home to only a mere dozen of “true mangrove” species.

AB  - When we think of infrastructure as a category, coral reefs and dunes may not come to mind. Yet, as we realize the social and physical challenges that await us with increasing climate change-driven impacts, we must reconceive what constitutes infrastructure that needs investment and maintenance. Taking an international perspective, the past few years have seen increasing attention and thought given to coordinating efforts to protect both biodiversity and human communities. Recent international cooperation has culminated in the United Nations declaring 2021-2030 the International Decade of Ecological Restoration, coinciding with the already adopted Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, facilitating national efforts to reduce disaster risk exposure. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (March 18, 2015). Both global efforts are unfolding while the Paris Agreement, which is focused in part on avoiding loss and damage associated with rapid changes in climate conditions, is also being progressively implemented.

AB  - When a revetment is selected to protect an eroding coastline, a proper implementation procedure is required to ensure that the revetment is successful. During the last 5 years (2016–2020), Thailand has armored 45.7 km of its shoreline with revetments. Its experience and the lessons learnt from past consecutive revetment implementations have shaped a procedure to integrate engineering, social, and environmental aspects into the whole process. The nine stages involved in Thailand’s revetment implementation are elaborated by using the Laem Ngoo beach revetment as an example. Although Thailand’s 2021 revetment implementation procedure may not be the best approach in different physical and social environment, it may be useful for coastal practitioners to learn from and follow if they find such an approach to be sustainable.

AB  - Wetlands, ecosystems at the interface of land and water, have a significant role in ensuring water and climate security of India given their role in the water cycle and multiple hydrological functions. The rapid loss of natural wetlands as has been experienced lately is as much a threat to water and climate security, as is an environmental crisis. The supply-side hydrology which characterized water sector for long has tended to overlook this role of wetlands, and at several instances, in an attempt to ‘develop’ these ecosystems, created several adverse ecological and socio-economic impacts. With broadening of thinking on water resources management from run-off to precipitation-based management incorporating land use, the role of ecosystems such as wetlands in building water system resilience becomes highly significant in Indian context. Forging ‘natural infrastructure’ of wetlands with the conventional ‘physical infrastructure’ of water resources can bring multiple advantages to the water sector and provide the required flexibility to address climate change-induced uncertainties and risks. Using catchment as a planning unit and a harmonized understanding of wetlands and their hydrological functions is the foundation step for collaboration between water and wetlands sectors. Communication between the two sectors can be bridged by wetlands managers articulating water needs and hydrological functions of wetlands in terms useful to water sector, and the latter, incorporating wetlands as nature-based solutions for meeting water management objectives.

AB  - Wetlands provide significant ecosystem services yet are ranked among some of the most imperiled habitats. To maximize prioritization of these habitats a better understanding of the full range of ecosystem functions is needed, starting with an examination of how coastal wetlands have been portrayed in restoration literature to date. This study consists of a literature review and the use of automated topic analyses aimed at (1) summarizing the current research related to coastal wetland restoration, (2) identifying the key fields of research, and (3) identifying research efforts connecting restoration and climate adaptation strategies (e.g. blue carbon). Of the 702 papers sourced for this analysis, most studies were conducted in North America and Europe. An increase in articles considering wetland restoration was found from 1985 to October 2020, with 40% of the research published just in the last triennia (2018–2020). Topic division highlights the emergence of studies related to management under climate change (e.g. sea level rise, adaptive management) and to carbon sequestration as separate fields of research from classical ecological studies. This reveals the need to ensure that classical ecological research is not neglected by work relating to climate strategies, which depend upon an accurate understanding of ecological processes.

AB  - Wetlands play a significant role in climate change mitigation. Under natural conditions, they sequester and store substantial amounts of carbon in their soils. This applies specifically to those wetlands that ensure progressive carbon accumulation at increasingly higher levels and in larger areas by positive feedback between biota and landform. Such wetlands include peatlands and blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows. Often, these wetland types coexist in coherent landscapes along the coast where they provide synergetic ecosystem services relevant for climate change mitigation and adaptation, e.g. by protecting inland freshwater resources and contributing to coastal protection. Degradation, in particular drainage, reverses the carbon pathways in these ecosystems and results in substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, both their conservation and restoration are important for climate change mitigation, which is the focus of this report. Despite the general preeminence of their carbon stocks, peatlands do not receive the same attention in climate policies as their blue carbon counterparts. To stimulate this attention, we scoped the opportunities for enhancing conservation and restoration of peatlands adjacent to mangroves in countries with mangrove-oriented climate change activities. First, we identified the countries worldwide where coastal peatlands - here defined as peatlands within 100 km from the coastline - and mangroves co-occur. Then, we checked which of these countries mention activities on mangroves or peatlands in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), followed by the identification of one region (and associated countries) with a positive attitude towards wetland directed action. Lastly, we selected key countries within that region and formulated priority actions for these countries based on literature research and interviews with experts. For these countries, we also collected information on peatland properties and land use trends. Worldwide, 58 countries and territories possess both mangroves and adjacent coastal peatlands. Yet, mangroves outweigh peatlands in the NDC commitments of these countries by far. Thirty-five countries have mentioned actions related to mangroves, while only eight mention actions related to peatlands, namely: Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico and Myanmar. No country with both ecosystems coexisting within the 100 km zone has commitments on peatlands only. Activities on peatlands and mangroves are prominent in and limited to countries in Southeast Asia and in the Caribbean, with a focus on mitigation in the former and adaptation in the latter region. Seven Caribbean countries (Belize, Costa Rica, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama) are particularly promising for further action when we look at their peatland/mangrove occurrences and NDC commitments. Most of these commitments currently relate to adaptation-aspects, such as water supply and regulation. Only Costa Rica has peatland specific mitigation activities, whereas Panama has indicated its intention to include peatland mitigation activities in its next NDC update. The other five countries have mangrove mitigation activities only and may therefore be receptive to including also peatland mitigation action in their NDCs. Other countries in the region have substantial areas of peatland, e.g. Cuba, but lack emission reduction measures for both mangroves and peatlands. In the mentioned seven Caribbean countries, coastal peatlands are concentrated in the tropical rain forest ecological zone, with less peatlands in the moist deciduous forest and dry forest zones. They are often found close to mangroves along the Caribbean coast, except in Costa Rica. The area of coastal peatlands outweighs the mangrove area in all seven countries, suggesting that the peatland carbon stocks will be much larger. The vegetation of coastal peatlands consists of various lifeforms and functional groups including mangroves, freshwater swamp forests, and open herbaceous communities. Peat depths vary from 50 5 cm up to 15 m. In the literature, the peatlands are mostly referred to as being ombrotrophic, i.e. solely rainwater fed, but peatlands dominated by herbaceous plants are likely to be minerotrophic, i.e. surface- and/or groundwater fed. No study in any Caribbean peatland thus far considers ecohydrological functionality, i.e. the hydrological factors conditioning peatland ecology. Land use trends in the identified countries indicate deforestation and expansion of grazing and cropland in the coastal peatlands, associated with drainage. These trends are confirmed by the interviewed experts working in the Caribbean region. Recommended priority actions in this region are: peatland mapping, with a strong ground-truthing component, setting-up a monitoring system for GHG fluxes and biodiversity, quantifying water regulation adaptive capacity of peatlands, developing and improving monitoring, verification and reporting methodologies for land use and GHG emissions, piloting peatland conservation and restoration projects in catchments with mangroves using a landscape approach to increase synergies, and building on existing project experiences. All these activities should go hand in hand with capacity building of personnel and technology as well as with raising awareness of the public, administrative authorities and policy makers.

AB  - Wetlands International and Boskalis, the global dredging and marine contractor, will intensify collaboration to enhance and restore coastal wetland habitat that not only support coastal protection and fisheries but store some of the world’s largest quantities of carbon. The agreement, signed today, will see the organizations first focus on developing the expertise and knowledge of ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems that can contribute to climate targets, adaptation and biodiversity conservation. ‘Blue carbon’ refers to the carbon stored by the world’s coastal ecosystems, mostly mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses. With increasing risks of flooding and erosion, the impacts of climate change on coastal systems and communities are becoming ever more apparent. The dredging sector has a large role to play in safeguarding these areas, providing innovative ways to protect coastlines and introducing adaptive measures. Jane Madgwick, Chief Executive Officer of Wetlands International said: “As natural coastal protection, carbon and water stores, wetlands are vital in helping communities and nature deal with the effects of climate change. Together with Boskalis, we aim to further develop our blue carbon knowledge and expertise to help nature-based approaches become best practice across the maritime and dredging sector.” Theo Baartmans, Board Member and Chief Operating Officer, Boskalis: “As a leader in the industry, Boskalis is keen to further develop nature-based solutions to protect and enrich coastal ecosystems from the consequences of climate change. By collaborating with Wetlands International we can combine our respective expertise to protect and further enhance coastal wetland habitats in terms of biodiversity whilst simultaneously utilizing their potential to store carbon.”

AB  - Wetlands are often considered as nature-based solutions that can provide a multitude of services of great social, economic and environmental value to humankind. Changes in land-use, water-use and climate can all impact wetland functions and services. These changes occur at scales extending well beyond the local scale of an individual wetland. However, in practical applications, engineering and management decisions usually focus on individual wetland projects and local site conditions. Here, we systematically investigate if and to what extent research has addressed the large-scale dynamics of landscape systems with multiple wetlands, hereafter referred to as wetlandscapes, which are likely to be relevant for understanding impacts of regional to global change. Although knowledge in many cases is still limited, evidence suggests that the aggregated effects of multiple wetlands in the landscape can differ considerably from the functions observed at individual wetland scales. This applies to provisioning of ecosystem services such as coastal protection, biodiversity support, groundwater level and soil moisture regulation, flood regulation and contaminant retention. We show that parallel and circular flow-paths, through which wetlands are interconnected in the landscape, may largely control such scale-function differences. We suggest ways forward for addressing the mismatch between the scales at which changes take place and the scale at which observations and implementation are currently made. These suggestions can help bridge gaps between researchers and engineers, which is critical for improving wetland function-effect predictability and management.

AB  - Wetland restoration and conservation provide a wealth of benefits such as storm surge reduction, fish and wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, recreation, job creation, and carbon sequestration (Batker et al., 2010; Jenkins et al., 2010). One of the largest challenges to wetland management is finding sufficient financing for coastal restoration and conservation that is on the scale that most stakeholders agree is needed. Carbon sequestration refers to the removal of atmospheric carbon, in this case by plants (photosynthesis) or other storage mechanisms (i.e., soils), which can mitigate greenhouse gases released as a result of changes in land use and the burning of fossil fuels (Euliss et al., 2006; Kayranli et al., 2010; Lal, 2004). Traditionally, the carbon sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed “blue carbon” (Mcleod et al., 2011; Nellemann et al., 2009), although the authors believe this definition should be expanded to include tidally influenced cypress-tupelo forests and freshwater marshes (Edwards et al., 2019; Lane et al., 2017). Wetland restoration is an effective climate change mitigation strategy because it enhances carbon sequestration and avoids carbon releases that would occur in the absence of restoration activities (Lane et al., 2016; Pendleton et al., 2012; Sapkota & White, 2019). Because wetlands sequester large amounts of carbon in soils and plants, the growing carbon market provides a potential funding source to support restoration and conservation of these valuable ecosystems (Murray et al., 2011). The goal of this chapter is to provide wetland managers a general understanding of wetlands’ role within carbon markets, how a wetland carbon project is developed, what challenges wetlands face within these markets, and identify information needs for future scientific and policy investigation to support current and future wetland carbon offset programs.

AB  - We studied nearshore diurnal fish catches and fisheries development in the early stages of mangrove rehabilitation around the village of Timbulsloko on the central north coast of Java, Indonesia. Mangrove rehabilitation was part of a Nature-based Solutions project to re-establish ecological and economic resilience by combining coastal engineering measures with ecological recovery in conjunction with sustainable land and resource use. Creel surveys were conducted during the onset of the monsoon season October–December 2017 to document yields of the three main fishing gears targeting mangrove finfish in a 419 ha mangrove backwater basin. These were accompanied by structured interviews to obtain fisher views on developments in these fisheries. Analysis of satellite images and GIS-mapping were used to follow developments in mangrove coverage and effort in the estuarine lift-net fishery. Mangrove recovery between 2005 and 2018 achieved 8.5% of its maximum possible (historic) cover potential in the basin and followed an exponential growth curve. The increase in lift-net installations targeting finfish lagged in comparison to mangrove increase, remaining virtually zero till 2014, after which it rapidly increased. A baseline study in 2015 found no mangrove-associated finfish fisheries occurring in our study area. The 51 fishers surveyed in 2017, indicated that fishing activity in the area had strongly increased since 2015, with 45% of fishers stating to having started fishing this area a year earlier or even more recently. A significant majority of 87% of respondents with more than one year of experience at this location, stated that their catches had changed in terms of either fish size, quantity or composition since they started fishing, while 86% indicated improvement in terms of either size or quantity. Fishing generated about 1.05 ± 1.11 (SD) USD/hr worth of catch to professional fishers using either of the two net-types studied. As per 2017, fishing had become profitable in our study area, whereas this kind of fishery practically did not exist prior to 2014. We suggest that higher profitability may partially explain the rapid growth seen in fishing activity in the mangrove rehabilitation area. However, for 12 of the 18 larger species caught, the mean size in the catch was lower than mean size of maturation, indicating that these fisheries were principally targeted towards immature nursery fish. The results highlight the need to manage this currently developing fishery, otherwise any benefits to the local community might be nullified by overfishing.

AB  - We simulate expected costs, market returns, and nonmarket ecosystem benefits associated with four oyster resources: harvested bottom reefs, off-bottom aquaculture, nonharvested (restored) reefs, and living shorelines. Benefit categories include market returns from harvest, improved water quality (reduced nitrogen), habitat for other species (blue crab and red drum), and shoreline protection. Bottom reefs and off-bottom aquaculture yield both market returns and nonmarket ecosystem benefits, whereas nonharvested reefs and living shorelines yield only nonmarket ecosystem benefits. Overall gross benefits are expected to be greater and much more variable for off-bottom aquaculture and living shorelines relative to harvested and nonharvested reefs. We find that harvested bottom reefs, off-bottom aquaculture, and living shorelines are expected to yield positive net benefits more often than not, but that nonharvested restored reefs are expected to yield positive net benefits only 36% of the time. We discuss the uncertainty and limitations surrounding these estimates.

AB  - We investigated the response of a tidal lagoon system to a unique situation of relative sea-level change induced by powerful earthquakes (up to Mw 7.1) on the east coast of New Zealand in 2010–2011. Spatiotemporal impacts were quantified using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets complemented by hydrodynamic modelling and evaluation of anthropogenic influences. Ground-level changes included examples of uplift and extensive subsidence (ca. 0.5 m) associated with intertidal area reductions, particularly in supratidal zones. ‘Coastal squeeze’ effects occurred where incompatible infrastructure prevented upland ecosystem movement with relative sea-level rise. Despite large-scale managed retreat, legacy effects of land-filling have reduced the reversibility of human modifications, impairing system resiliency through poor land-use design. Elsewhere, available space in the intertidal range shows that natural environment movement could be readily assisted by simple engineering techniques though is challenged by competing land-use demands. Quantification of gains and losses showed that lagoon expansion into previously defended areas is indeed required to sustain critical habitats, highlighting the importance of a whole-system view. Identifiable coastal planning principles include the need to assess trade-offs between natural and built environments in the design of hazard management plans, requiring greater attention to the natural movement of ecosystems and areas involved. Treating these observations as a scenario illustrates the mechanisms by which coastal squeeze effects may develop under global sea-level rise, but our purpose is to help avoid them by identifying appropriate human responses. We highlight the need for an improved focus on whole-system resilience, and the importance of disaster recovery processes for adaptation to climate change.

AB  - We explore the requirements for adapting coastal protection EU-wide indicators nationally. The aim of this research is threefold: (a) to map coastal protection at the national level; (b) to assess the congruence between the regional and national coastal protection estimates; and (c) to qualitatively assess the congruence of our findings with subnational estimates. We assessed coastal protection capacity, exposure, and demand and adapted them for the coastal zone of Greece. We quantitatively compared our findings with the results of the EU model. Through visual interpretation, we compared national estimates with those for the coastal zone of Peloponnese. Most islands have lower protection capacity than the mainland areas, while the southern part of the country’s coastal zone is the most exposed to natural hazards. Higher coastal protection demand was detected in the country’s largest cities (Athens, Thessaloniki). Areas of attention for management were small and medium islands and urban centres, as they mostly revealed high demand and exposure but the lowest natural capacity. The differences observed in the modelling outputs across scales are attributed to the differences in the demarcation process of the coastal zone, the additional variables considered, the terminology used, and the experts involved. Such national adaptations should be considered in order to build or update EU-wide indicators for coastal protection and beyond, towards a rule-based rather than a one-size-fits-all methodology.

AB  - We discuss the importance and role of urban wetlands using Taiwan as a model to illustrate how water could be managed to support a growing world population while facing the social, economic, and environmental uncertainties that arise as the effects of global change become more prominent. Taiwan was selected because the island is densely populated, rainfall is high, and landslides, earthquakes, and typhoons are common. These parameters, coupled with the impacts of population growth and global change, make Taiwan a good model where innovative strategies can be developed to manage water in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. By 2050, the global population is expected to increase by about two billion people and urban areas are expected to expand by about 30%. More people and a lack of space combined with sea-level rise and other aspects of global change are predicted to have substantial impacts on the world’s major coastal cities, such as Taipei. As such, innovative approaches to urban planning, including the development of strategies to recycle and use water sustainably, will be needed to maintain food and water security. Examples of constructed wetlands and the benefits provided are presented.

AB  - We are very pleased to present you with the fi rst
three editions of the RECREATE Policy Briefs,
which present the key outcomes of the project
deliverables and translate them into policyrelevant messages. These fi rst three RECREATE
Policy Briefs are directly based on the so-called
Evidence-Based Narratives (EBNs), which have
been produced by us following a specifi c request
from DG RTD of the European Commission. The
purpose of the EBNs is to describe, in a narrative
form, the potential but also the risks and remaining
challenges of particularly promising innovations
in the DG RTD priority areas of Systemic EcoInnovation, Nature-Based Solutions and Climate
Change Services. Ultimately, the objective is to
support DG RTD with the formulation of future
H2020 Work Programmes.
Policy Brief no. 3 discusses so-called naturebased solutions (NBS) in two diff erent application
areas: (1) costal protection and (2) urban drainage
systems. NBS, as defi ned by the EC, are “living
solutions inspired by, continuously supported by
and using nature”. In the two mentioned application
areas, NBS have the potential to not only serve
their purpose in a more eff ective and a more
sustainable way than grey infrastructure””. They
also off er multiple co-benefi ts such as enhancing
the environment, saving raw materials, improving
public health, fostering biodiversity and creating
new recreational spaces.
The challenges to a more widespread
implementation of NBS are of diff erent sorts.
First of all, there are of course still a number of
knowledge gaps about the NBS themselves and
their applicability and eff ectiveness in various fi elds.
Furthermore, there is uncertainty specifi cally with
regard to the long-term performance and costeff ectiveness of the various solutions. Hence, what
is needed in addition to research on the solutions
as such are longitudinal studies and research that
tests, proves and improves these solutions over
longer time spans. Yet in many cases, the longterm performance and cost-eff ectiveness has in
fact been proven but is simply not suffi ciently taken
into account by decision-makers, who tend to think
in more short-term horizons. Therefore, support
for additional research needs to be accompanied
by awareness-raising measures and fi nancial
solutions that encourage decision-makers to opt
for the NBS.

AB  - Wave energy conversion technologies have recently attracted more attention as part of global efforts to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy resources. While ocean waves can provide renewable energy, they can also be destructive to coastal areas that are often densely populated and vulnerable to coastal erosion. There have been a variety of efforts to mitigate the impacts of wave- and storm-induced erosion; however, they are either temporary solutions or approaches that are not able to adapt to a changing climate. This study explores a green and sustainable approach to mitigating coastal erosion from hurricanes through wave energy conversion. A barrier island, Dauphin Island, off the coast of Alabama, is used as a test case. The potential use of wave energy converter farms to mitigate erosion due to hurricane storm surges while simultaneously generating renewable energy is explored through simulations that are forced with storm data using the XBeach model. It is shown that wave farms can impact coastal morphodynamics and have the potential to reduce dune and beach erosion, predominantly in the western portion of the island. The capacity of wave farms to influence coastal morphodynamics varies with the storm intensity.

AB  - Wave attenuation is a key process that impacts activities at the coastal land margin and is an ecosystem service provided by many natural landscapes. Traditional modeling tools for wind wave attenuation require advanced expertise to apply. We present an alternative, GIS-based option for estimating wave attenuation, the Wave Attenuation Toolbox (WATTE). The outputs are a map of wave height transmission as a percentage of the original wave height and a line demarking the extent of wave exposure onshore. WATTE supports a variety of inputs, ranging from outputs of ecological and landscape evolution models to remote sensing data, and past, present, and future conditions can be analyzed. The present version of WATTE models wave attenuation as an exponential decay process, and a recommendation table for exponential decay constants is derived from previous studies. Three examples of applying WATTE to marsh environments are described.

AB  - Wave attenuation is a central process in the mechanics of a healthy salt marsh. Understanding how wave attenuation varies with vegetation and hydrodynamic conditions informs models of other marsh processes that are a function of wave energy (e.g. sediment transport) and allows for the incorporation of marshes into coastal protection plans. Here, we examine the evolution of wave height across a tidal salt marsh in San Francisco Bay. Instruments were deployed along a cross-shore transect, starting on the mudflat and crossing through zones dominated by Spartina foliosa and Salicornia pacifica. This dataset is the first to quantify wave attenuation for these vegetation species, which are abundant in the intertidal zone of California estuaries. Measurements were collected in the summer and winter to assess seasonal variation in wave attenuation. Calculated drag coefficients of S. foliosa and S. pacifica were similar, indicating equal amounts of vegetation would lead to similar energy dissipation; however, S. pacifica has much greater biomass close to the bed (<20 cm) and retains biomass throughout the year, and therefore, it causes more total attenuation. S. foliosa dies back in the winter, and waves often grow across this section of the marsh. For both vegetation types, attenuation was greatest for low water depths, when the vegetation was emergent. For both seasons, attenuation rates across S. pacifica were the highest and were greater than published attenuation rates across similar (Spartina alterniflora) salt marshes for the comparable depths. These results can inform designs for marsh restorations and management plans in San Francisco Bay and other estuaries containing these species.

AB  - Water security in urban areas is threatened by a multitude of direct and indirect drivers. On the one hand, the demand for water is increasing on a daily basis as the urban population and lifestyle needs increase; on the other hand, events such as floods, tropical cyclones, and other natural hazards result in disruption of water provisioning systems and processes. Additionally, climate change impacts such as heat waves and sea-level rise affect the sustainability of water supplies in urban areas. Conventionally, hard engineering structures and strategies have been implemented around the world to address water needs in urban areas and solutions that are often costly and intrusive to the natural environment. Nature-based solutions (NBS) in the past years emerged as a framework for exploring the potential of soft engineering solutions—as an alternative for managing urban planning, building climate resilience, and sustaining water needs of the urban communities. In this chapter, the following points are explained: (a) review of selected nature-oriented conceptual framings and practical options that apply to urban water systems, (b) illustration of existing NBS practices such as permeable pavements, green roofs, and bioretention ponds in urban landscape architecture planning, and (c) future of urban landscapes with comparative context of traditional versus nature-based water management practices. The conclusion draws attention to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) that is aiming to prevent, halt, and reverse the degradation of ecosystems globally. The aim is to present a synthesis that can steer integrated development planning while addressing basic water needs, climate resilience, and ecosystems protection in all settings and particularly in urban landscapes.

AB  - Vietnam’s international economic integration is strongly promoted through various forms, following a roadmap for the proper adoption of international principles and standards of the global economy and market. The country is constantly striving to move from a brown economy to a blue and green economy, for which the ecosystem-based approaches have been employed as critical factors. The National Vision for Socio-Economic Development to 2020 has emphasised on nature-based solutions for environmental protection, creating an essential basis for policies and practices emerging areas of interest in ecosystem-based approaches. Despite the promulgation of laws and decrees, ratification of international agreements, and participation in international initiatives, policy reviews show limited entry points for mainstreaming ecosystem-based solutions in decisions and practices. This chapter provides an analysis of the policy and practices of ecosystem-based approaches with 14 case studies across Vietnam. They were classified into different categories depending on the nature of solutions and level of blue–green integration. The shortcomings and challenges facing those models are also analysed in order to contribute to the efforts of bringing opportunities for further integration of blue–green infrastructure at both national and local levels.

AB  - Vietnam is at crossroads: being a middle income country now, it has to deal with social, economic and environmental challenges better known from affluent countries, while still being in the transition from an agricultural to an industrial in a society transiting from rural to urban. At the same time, Vietnam has to prepare for the diverse impacts of climate change, a process beyond its control, by developing adaptation measures safeguarding the social and environmental basis of the society and economy. This requires strategic planning with a focus on enhancing the resilience of economy and society; supporting differentiation and diversity is a core element of this, in rural as much as in urban settings. Current policies need to be updated to accommodate both the value of diversity, and the long term perspective required to mitigate climate change impacts.

AB  - Vegetation on foreshores in close vicinity to sea dikes may prove beneficial as regulating ecosystem service in the context of coastal defense, dike safety, and flood protection by reducing loads on these defense structures. Predominantly, a decrease in wave heights and bottom shear stresses is hypothesized, which calls for an inclusion in design procedures of coastal defense structures. In contrast to heterogeneous and variable salt marsh vegetation, this study uses surrogate vegetation models for systematic hydraulic experiments in a wave flume, without modeling specific plant species a priori. Froude-scale experiments are performed in order to investigate the effect of salt marsh vegetation on the wave transformation processes on the foreshore and wave run-up at sea dikes. The effect of plant and wave properties on wave transmission, energy dissipation, and wave run-up at a 1:6 sloped smooth dike are presented and discussed, focusing on the wave–vegetation–structure interaction. Vegetated foreshores can contribute to wave attenuation, where an increasing relative vegetation height hv/h results in decreased wave run-up on the dike by up to 16.5% at hv/h = 1.0.

AB  - Vegetation is an important feature of coastal dunes and is often managed to stabilize restored dunes and provide coastal protection. Despite a high investment in planting and management efforts, little is known about how vegetation is affected by wind and wave run-up. The objectives of this study were to 1) investigate the lift forces and drag moments experienced by coastal dune vegetation from wind and wave run-up and 2) relate them to flow properties and plant morphology. Panicum amarum, Ammophila breviligulata, A. arenaria and Cakile maritima were subjected to laboratory wind and wave run-up conditions. Measurements were taken of fluid velocity, run-up depth, Reynolds number, and plant biophysical properties. The plant lift and drag responses were recorded with the use of a novel sensor designed to address the complexities induced by the flexibility and morphology of real vegetation under varying conditions. Regression analysis was used to describe the relationships between plant response and plant structure and flow properties. Experiments showed that wind induced a constant lift force and drag moment on plants over time, whereas run-up induced plant response was time-dependent. Plant height (R2 = 0.64, p < 0.001) and number of leaves (R2 = 0.67, p = 0.30) were the most important predictors of drag moment from wind and run-up experiments, respectively. Plant drag coefficients from wind (5.0 × 10−4 to 3.6 × 10−2) and run-up (2.7 × 10−3 to 1.7) were negatively correlated with flow turbulence, indicating that coastal dune plants likely have biophysical adaptations to the induced forces, such as a propensity for streamlining. In particular, our data suggests that tall and thin dune grasses are best adapted and used on the dune crest and fronts to mitigate wind energy, while low shrubby plants are best used on the backbeach or dune toe to reduce run-up energy. Our study provides valuable information on the ability of dune vegetation to interrupt flow, such that modelers and managers can better understand how to best protect coastlines.

AB  - Vegetation can protect communities by reducing nearshore wave height and altering sediment transport processes. However, quantitative approaches for evaluating the coastal protection services, or benefits, supplied by vegetation to people in a wide range of coastal environments are lacking. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we propose an integrated modeling approach for quantifying how vegetation modifies nearshore processes—including the attenuation of wave height, mean and total water level—and reduces shoreline erosion during storms. We apply the model to idealized seagrass-sand and mangrove-mud cases, and illustrate its potential by quantifying how those habitats reduce water levels and sediment loss beyond what would be observed in the absence of vegetation. The integrated modeling approach provides an efficient way to quantify the coastal protection services supplied by vegetation and highlights specific research needs for improved representations of the ways in which vegetation modifies wave-induced processes.

AB  - Vegetated foreshores adjacent to engineered structures (so-called hybrid flood defenses), are considered to have high potential in reducing flood risk, even in the face of sea level rise and increasing storminess. However, foreshores such as salt marshes and mangrove forests are generally characterized by relatively strong temporal and spatial variations in geometry and vegetation characteristics (e.g., stem height and density), which causes uncertainties with regards to their protective value under extreme storm conditions. Currently, no method is available to assess the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, taking into account the aforementioned uncertainties. This paper presents a method to determine the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, integrating models and stochastic parameters that describe dike failure and wave propagation over a vegetated foreshore. Two dike failure mechanisms are considered: failure due to (i) wave overtopping and (ii) wave impact on revetments. Results show that vegetated foreshores cause a reduction in failure probability for both mechanisms. This effect is more pronounced for wave impact on revetments than for wave overtopping, since revetment failure occurs at relatively low water levels. The relevance of different uncertainties depends on the protection level and associated dike height and strength. For relatively low dikes (i.e., low protection levels), vegetation remains stable in design conditions, and plays an important role in reducing wave loads. In case of higher protection levels, hence for more robust dikes, vegetation is less important than foreshore geometry, because of expected stem breakage of the vegetation under these more extreme conditions. The integrated analysis of uncertainties in hydraulic loads, dike geometry and foreshore characteristics in this paper enables the comparison between nature-based flood defenses and traditionally engineered solutions, and allows coastal engineers to design hybrid flood defenses worldwide.

AB  - Urbanization, population growth, and climate change are increasing flood risks in many parts of the world. Some countries have started developing approaches to reduce flood risk by integrating climate change adaptation. Conventional engineering solutions, such as the construction of dams, levees, and other structures alone, cannot reduce combat these increasing flood risks. This chapter aims to assess the policies of flood risk reduction and innovative measures of managed retreat and green infrastructure. It reviews recent efforts in major flood-prone countries such as the United States, European countries, and Japan. These countries are increasing their investments in flood risk reduction and promoting innovative programs. Managed retreats that relocate houses from high-risk areas to safer locations can eliminate flood risks. Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions are expected to resolve multiple issues, such as preserving ecosystems and promoting local industries, in addition to reducing flood risks. This chapter examines the lessons and challenges of innovative measures to reduce flood risks under a changing climate.

AB  - Urbanization is vital to economic growth but has led to fragmented natural habitats and increased greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants, resulting in biodiversity loss, environmental pollution, and climate change, all of which compromise the well-being of urban residents. Urban vegetation—i.e., the planting of trees and provision of parks and green spaces—can help address these challenges by drawing down greenhouse gases, filtering out pollutants, soaking up stormwaters, and providing shade during hot days. However, the benefits of greening urban spaces are not equal everywhere and can depend heavily on local climates and economic status. If city planners fail to consider the limitations and context-specific benefits of urban vegetation, city greening schemes, which are often costly, will likely fail to realize their full potential. To help guide city decision makers, we analyzed the potential benefits of urban vegetation for 2,148 cities around the world. Although urban vegetation commonly benefits the well-being of urban residents in terms of access to green spaces and stormwater control, other benefits were only significant in cities with certain climates and socio-economic status.

AB  - Urbanization is a primary cause of wetland loss in coastal metropolitan regions. Therefore, it challenges the preservation of biodiversity and the provision of key ecosystem services for urban settlements. These services include leisure and recreation, climate and water regulation, water purification, and especially alleviation of natural hazards. Tsunami flood mitigation is a particularly valuable regulating service provided by these wetlands, as recently evidenced during the 2010 tsunami that hit the central coast of Chile. The Concepción Metropolitan Area (CMA), located on the central coast of Chile, has experienced noticeable wetland loss in recent decades. Our study focused on the Rocuant-Andalién wetland, which has been particularly affected by urbanization. This wetland strongly contributes to flood control, and has provided effective protection against the CMA’s latest tsunamis (1835 and 2010). Based on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), we have quantified urban growth over the wetland, both executed and projected under the Metropolitan Urban Plan of Concepción (MUPC). Recent loss in wetland area by urban growth has been quantified using land use and cover change (LUCC) maps from 2004 to 2014, obtained from the classification of Landsat images. Prospective changes (considering the complete MUPC deployment) have been inferred by combining the MUPC with the 2014 land cover map. In addition, we quantified the observed effect and planned urban growth on the wetland protected area, geoforms and potential flooding based on the area affected by the last Tsunami. Results show that urban areas have increased by 28% between 2004 and 2014, while future increase is expected to reach 238%. In contrast, wetland area has decreased by 10% from 2004 to 2014 and is expected to decrease by up to 32 %. Thus, the MUPC is not contributing to the mitigation of wetland loss nor the preservation of its biodiversity and ecosystem services. Implications for coastal planning are discussed.

We ask what new opportunities hybrid infrastructure—built environments coupled with landscape-scale biophysical structures and processes—offer for building different layers of resilience critical for dealing with increased variation in the frequency, magnitude and different phases of climate-related disturbances. With its more diverse components and different internal logics, hybrid infrastructure opens up alternative and additive ways of building resilience for and through critical infrastructure, by providing a wider range of functions and responses. Second, hybrid infrastructure points toward greater opportunities for ongoing (re)design at the landscape level, where structure and function can be constantly renegotiated and recombined.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) have gained increasing attention as an urban heat island mitigation measure. Informed by landscape ecology, the amount (composition), and spatial character and distribution (configuration) of UGS patches should determine the UGS cooling effect. UGS pattern-cooling effect relationship and the factors that may affect this relationship have rarely been examined. This study aims to fill these gaps by taking a comparative approach across time and space, and studying how UGS pattern-cooling effect relationship is affected by land use. Landsat imageries are used to produce land cover and land surface temperature maps (LST). This research demonstrates that: 1) apart from the UGS composition, UGS configuration affects LST, and puts forward generalizations on UGS pattern-LST relationships in cities, and 2) UGS pattern and its relationships with LST are both affected by land use. This study provides insights into more efficient management of UGS for higher cooling effects.

AB  - Urban and periurban ocean developments impact 1.5% of the global exclusive economic zones, and the demand for ocean space and resources is increasing. As we strive for a more sustainable future, it is imperative that we better design, manage, and conserve urban ocean spaces for both humans and nature. We identify three key objectives for more sustainable urban oceans: reduction of urban pressures, protection and restoration of ocean ecosystems, and support of critical ecosystem services. We describe an array of emerging evidence-based approaches, including greening grayinfrastructure, restoring habitats, and developing biotechnologies. We then explore new economic instruments and incentives for supporting these new approaches and evaluate their feasibility in delivering these objectives. Several of these tools have the potential to help bring nature back to the urban ocean while also addressing some of the critical needs of urban societies, such as climate adaptation, seafood production, clean water, and recreation, providing both human and environmental benefits in some of our most impacted ocean spaces.

AB  - Understanding blue carbon storage and accumulation prior to engineering projects is essential for assessing the potential co-benefit of carbon storage for natural climate solutions. This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia (BC), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 ± 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 ± 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 ± 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m2/yr (median 70.1 g C/m2/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study’s quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment. We outline subsequent research needed for salt marshes such as Boundary Bay to be included in voluntary carbon markets in British Columbia.

AB  - Tsunamis, storm surges, flooding, and erosion pose serious threats to the world's coastal systems, particularly in the tropics. These immediate threats have been accelerated by both natural and man-made factors. The majority of countries have responded to these threats with severe protective measures, exacerbating existing ecosystem problems. To combat this threat, there is an immediate need for sustainable coastal protection measures. Vegetation Bioshields are one such measure to achieve this. This review examines the current state of vegetation bioshields in South Asia, the benefits and drawbacks of their use, and future prospects. Case studies from India and Sri Lanka are used to illustrate the current state of vegetation bioshields. The majority of vegetation bioshield projects were constructed in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami with inadequate design, maintenance, and follow-up, resulting in an extremely low success rate. Additionally, community participation is limited in a number of vegetation bioshield planting campaigns. A viable alternative to hard structures is the concept of hybrid structures, which combine hard structures with natural ecosystems such as vegetation. A comprehensive inventory of indigenous species and policy changes aimed at their conservation and management are urgently needed. Simultaneously, strict enforcement of environmental laws is required.

AB  - Tsunamis pose significant challenges for disaster reduction efforts due to the multi-hazard, cascading nature of these events, including a range of different potential triggering and consequential hazards. Although infrequent, they have the potential to cause devastating human and economic losses. Effective urban planning has been recognised as an important strategy for reducing disaster risk in cities. However, there have been limited studies on urban planning for tsunami-prone areas, and there have been wide ranging strategies adopted globally. This is an international study aimed at exploring the status of urban planning in tsunami areas and better understanding potential urban planning strategies to reduce disaster risk in coastal regions. Drawing upon the work of an international collaborative research team, in this article, we present the findings of a systematic review of the urban planning literature. Using the PRISMA guidelines, 56 papers were selected, and three guiding questions informed the review. Further empirical investigations were carried out in Sri Lanka by a local research team, including twelve semi-structured interviews with representatives from agencies in urban planning, construction, and disaster management, and a focus group representing town and country planning, architecture, structural engineering, disaster management, landscape and geospatial planning, building services, green buildings and infrastructure and environmental management fields. The combined analysis reveals insights into the characteristics of the literature, as well as the nature of existing strategies for urban planning in tsunami-prone areas, grouped into six broad themes: community participation, spatial planning, soft and hard engineering;,evacuation planning, and resilience thinking. The findings also reveal limitations in existing strategies, including their failure to address multi-hazard threats and systemic risk, as well as inadequate community participation, and limited access to timely disaster risk information. The findings are used to inform an initial model of urban planning strategies in tsunami-prone areas that can be used before a hazard event occurs, during and in the immediate response to a hazard event, and during recovery and reconstruction following a disaster.

AB  - Tropical storms and hurricanes bring extreme winds, rain, storm surge, and waves to coastal communities with often devastating impacts. With nearly 40% of the global population living in coastal communities, it is critical to develop and test novel sustainable shoreline-protection measures. Alternative solutions can be inspired from natural ecosystems, such as coral reefs to re-imaging coastal armoring solutions, such as seawalls. Natural ecosystems such as coral reefs have been shown to provide reduce coastal hazard risks in an ecofriendly and cost-effective way. Nevertheless, they are not typically accounted as coastal infrastructure as their protective effects vary with the hydrodynamic conditions and the condition of the reef itself. Moreover, the impacts of key parameters from the coral composition to the coral density have yet to be properly investigated. Conversely, seawalls represent a well-documented coastal armoring structural solution against wave action and the impact of storm surge. However, traditional seawall designs do not dissipate wave energy; they reflect waves creating more turbulent conditions which make sites and their surroundings more susceptible to erosion and damage. In addition, they negatively impact the marine environment by modifying aquatic habitats. This research aims thus to bridge ecology (green) and engineering (gray) through the investigation of two eco-engineering paradigms of shoreline protection: a hybrid artificial coral reefs and a novel facetted porous stepped seawall design. The performance of both systems in wave energy dissipation was evaluated through scaled physical testing at the University of Miami’s Surge Structure Atmosphere INteraction (SUSTAIN) Facility. In the absence of universally accepted design guidelines for green/gray shoreline-protection measures, exploring such design solutions in conjunction can lead to more efficient and sustainable shoreline protection systems.

AB  - Tropical cyclones originating in Indian Ocean region and Bay of Bengal are one of the most devastating hazards causing loss of life and properties along the coastal areas of India and Bangladesh. With anthropogenic-induced climate change and related meteorological effects, they are expected to intensify in the future. Although both countries have already taken several measures toward cyclone risk management reflected through the drastic reduction in the number of human fatalities due to cyclone, loss and damages of properties and critical infrastructure are continuing. Over a long period, the exploitation of mangrove forests, the natural buffer to the impacts of cyclone, has aggravated the situation. The present study attempts to identify the exposure of population and critical infrastructure to the probable future cyclone scenario and how they can be safeguarded by using advanced frontier technologies.

AB  - Traditionally, the ocean economy is viewed solely as a mechanism for economic growth. In this business-as-usual approach, large-scale industrial economies have developed the ocean economy through the exploitation of maritime and marine resources, often without consideration of how those activities impact the future health or productivity of those same resources. This has led to aquatic ecosystems being viewed and treated as limitless resources; the marine environment becoming a dumping ground for waste; overfishing diminishing fishing stocks; ocean habitats being degraded from coastal developments; sea-level rise impacting coastal communities and infrastructure; increasing ocean acidification; and the marginalisation of poor coastal communities. Recognising the failings of the traditional ocean economy, there is a transition underway around the world towards the Blue Economy. This concept moves beyond the business-as-usual approach with economic development and ocean health complementary to one another. In the Blue Economy, the environmental risks of and ecological degradation from economic activity are mitigated or significantly reduced. Therefore, economic activity is in balance with the long-term capacity of the ocean ecosystems to support this activity and remain healthy and resilient. This book will provide an overview of the various technologies used to promote cross-sectoral and multi-scalar collaboration, facilitate the integrated management of sectors and resources, foster partnerships between governments and industry, encourage R&D in new technologies in resource use and management, and scale-up innovative financing mechanisms in the development of a Blue Economy. Also, the book will contain in-depth case studies that illustrate how locations, of differing climates, lifestyles and income levels, have implemented technologies to facilitate the development of the Blue Economy.

AB  - Traditionally engineers have resorted to hard or grey infrastructure to defend vulnerable coastlines against the forces of coastal processes. However, there is growing interest and awareness in more sustainable or soft coastal defence approaches that work with the forces generated by coastal processes to achieve the same levels of coastal protection and gain the benefits of ecosystem services that hard infrastructure does not offer. Countries bordering and within the Western Indian Ocean have a large collective coastal population of about sixty million people. These countries are also among the most under-resourced and most at risk to the effects of climate change and sea-level rise in the world. This study intended to investigate and propose green coastal protection infrastructure options that could be adopted in countries in the Western Indian Ocean. A literature review was completed to understand the spectrum of coastal protection infrastructure including grey or hard infrastructure, eco-friendly infrastructure, hybrid infrastructure, and green or soft infrastructure. The advantages and disadvantages of each coastal protection type were discussed. Furthermore, the study explored a few examples of each coastal protection type. Literature was also sourced on ways to quantitatively evaluate the vulnerability of coastlines in the Western Indian Ocean using variables that are easily obtainable for countries that may not have detailed coastal surveys or historical records of coastal data. Finally, quantitative comparative evaluation methods of coastal infrastructure were investigated to account for the ecosystem services provided by soft infrastructure which are often ignored in traditional evaluation approaches. The information from the literature review informed the proposal of green and hybrid infrastructure strategies that could be adopted in countries in the Western Indian Ocean. Case studies were conducted in three Western Indian Ocean Countries to illustrate how green coastal infrastructure can be incorporated into coastal defence strategies. The case studies investigated were Mon Choisy, Albion, and Case Noyale in Mauritius, Ponta Gea and Praia Nova in Beria, Mozambique, and Richards Bay in South Africa.

AB  - Traditional flood risk paradigms and associated strategies are no longer sufficient to address global flood adaptation challenges due to climate change and continued development in floodplains. The current flood adaptation approach is failing to take advantage of the benefits provided by intact ecosystems and perpetuates social and economic inequities, leaving those who are most vulnerable at highest risk. Rooted in the experiences of the United States, we propose a new framework, the Flood Adaptation Hierarchy, which prioritizes outcomes into six tiers. Overall, the tiers distinguish between nature and nature-based solutions, with preference given to natural ecosystems. The most important outcome in our hierarchy is to avoid risk by protecting and restoring natural floodplains; next, eliminate risk by moving communities away from danger; and then to accommodate water with passive measures and active risk reduction measures. We include, but deprioritize, a defense of community assets using nature-based engineering and hardened engineering. Throughout the hierarchy, we provide guidance on the equity considerations of flood adaptation decision making and highlight “impacts,” “resources,” and “voices” as important equity dimensions. Implementing the framework through an iterative process, using justification criteria to manage movement among tiers, alongside equity considerations, will support adaptation to changing environmental and social conditions and contribute to risk reduction at scale. Though this approach is focused on U.S. flood management and adaptation, prioritizing risk reduction, elimination of risk, and accommodation of hazards over the defense against threats not only has global applicability to flood adaptation, but should also be evaluated for applicability to other climate-driven challenges.

The research presented in the report shows that coastal wetlands can reduce property damage from storms and that these effects can be readily incorporated into the insurance industry’s risk models. These results help inform (i) risk reduction and conservation management priorities and (ii) the development of incentives for the conservation and restoration of natural defenses.

Naturebased Solutions (NbS), although still in its infancy, is a relatively new concept that can harness the power and sophistication of nature to turn environmental, social and economic challenges into innovation opportunities. The aim of this thesis is to estimate the potential impacts of NbS in the cities of Malmö (Sweden) and Malaga (Spain), and study and compare the different mechanisms used for their implementation and use. The thesis uses expert interviews as well as the EKLIPSE framework, a methodological tool used to evaluate NbS initiatives, taking into account their impacts on the triple bottom line and providing a set of indicators and methods for their evaluation. Based on the characteristics of the NbS projects identified in both cities, these solutions are especially effective at tackling challenges in the areas of water management, climate mitigation and adaptation, and urban regeneration. The use of these solutions seems to be driven by their ability to adapt cities to current climates and mitigate the effects of climate change, although some barriers are also identified, such as lack of knowledge of the impacts on the social and economic systems and their effectiveness in the long-term, or lack of political commitment and funding for their application. NbS have potential to address some of the environmental, social and economic problems of cities, but the projects need to be designed with a clear objective in mind in order to be successful, and their effectiveness evaluated through the use of indicators.

AB  - Today coastal erosion is usually exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change and results in the loss of income and cultural norms, as well as in the loss or degradation of ecosystem services. Public perceptions and participation have an important role – often a legal one – in coastal management and response to coastal hazards. The objective of this study is to assess residents’ perceptions about coastal erosion and the significance of coastal protection and restoration. This paper presents the results of a study conducted in Mytilene, the main city on the island of Lesvos, Greece. Residents recognize the impact of coastal erosion on their daily lives and recognize the anthropogenic causes of coastal erosion problems including climate change impacts. They admit their share in creating pressures and impacts on the beaches and are aware of the common protection works such as sand nourishment, groins and breakwaters construction. However, while they perceive beaches as the public common, residents indicated unwillingness to pay for coastal zone restoration and protection. Results suggest that respondents prefer volunteering activities and public awareness actions to payment or charges for coastal zone protection.

AB  - To limit global warming to 1.5 °C, vast amounts of CO2 will have to be removed from the atmosphere via Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Enhancing the CO2 sequestration of ecosystems will require not just one approach but a portfolio of CDR options, including so-called nature-based approaches alongside CDR options that are perceived as more technical. Creating a CDR “supply curve” would however imply that all carbon removals are considered to be perfect substitutes. The various co-benefits of nature-based CDR approaches militate against this. We discuss this aspect of nature-based solutions in connection with the enhancement of blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) such as mangrove or seagrass habitats. Enhancing BCEs can indeed contribute to CO2 sequestration, but the value of their carbon storage is low compared to the overall contribution of their ecosystem services to wealth. Furthermore, their property rights are often unclear, i.e. not comprehensively defined or not enforced. Hence, payment schemes that only compensate BCE carbon sequestration could create tradeoffs at the expense of other important, often local, ecosystem services and might not result in socially optimal outcomes. Accordingly, one chance for preserving and restoring BCEs lies in the consideration of all services in potential compensation schemes for local communities. Also, local contexts, management structures, and benefit-sharing rules are crucial factors to be taken into account when setting up international payment schemes to support the use of BCEs and other nature- or ecosystem-based CDR. However, regarding these options as the only hope of achieving more CDR will very probably not bring about the desired outcome, either for climate mitigation or for ecosystem preservation. Unhalted degradation, in turn, will make matters worse due to the large amounts of stored carbon that would be released. Hence, countries committed to climate mitigation in line with the Paris targets should not hide behind vague pledges to enhance natural sinks for removing atmospheric CO2 but commit to scaling up engineered CDR.

This peer exchange summary provides a synthesis of the key examples of nature-based solutions and recommendations for successful planning and implementation. In addition, the report discusses challenges that can arise across planning, permitting, partnerships and engagement, engineering and design, and monitoring and maintenance. Similar challenges were identified at all four peer exchanges, including, for example: uncertainty around the performance of nature-based solutions; insufficient understanding of the costs and benefits of nature-based solutions and funding available for them; lengthy permitting processes; and complexities associated with the broad coordination required to implement and maintain nature-based solutions. The peer exchanges were held at: Mobile, Alabama – February 15, 2018; Oakland, California – April 10, 2018; Lewes, Delaware – April 17, 2018; and Wilmington, North Carolina – April 19, 2018.

AB  - To help mitigate the impacts of climate change, many nature-based solutions are being explored. These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as ‘Blue Carbon’ ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62–72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (±65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future.

AB  - To close carbon emission gaps and achieve the Paris Climate Agreement, mangrove restoration has emerged as a potential solution. These forests are known for their exceptional carbon sequestration rates, but the attention for mangrove restoration and similar climate solutions in the marine and coastal environment is limited as compared to their terrestrial counterparts. By broadening our scope from a sole focus on the climate mitigation potential of these aptly coined ‘blue carbon’ solutions, towards the appreciation of their full range of benefits, the case for marine nature regeneration becomes more compelling. In this thesis, I developed a new impact assessment framework for mangrove restoration, that includes indicators for sustainability impact as well as indicators for effective implementation. The framework is based on the concept of a Safe and Just Operating Space and is the first to translate this concept to the intervention level. Based on expert interviews and literature review, it explicitly considers the impact of the natural system as well as the impact arising from human interference. Altogether, 30 impact dimensions have been identified, underpinning the fact that benefits of mangrove restoration go far beyond its climate mitigation potential alone. This is complemented by an overview of challenges and facilitating conditions that typically influence the implementation success of mangrove restoration efforts. The feasibility of local application of these frameworks is assessed through a case study on mangrove restoration on Bonaire. A selection of impact dimensions in this context is discussed, but data required for quantification was lacking. The case study score on indicators for effective implementation left only three indicators with considerable space for improvement. Mangrove restoration as performed on Bonaire may therefore provide useful lessons for efforts elsewhere. An additional community perception study suggested a difference in apprehension of mangrove ecosystem services between different demographic groups that exist on the island. It also showed how active engagement with restoration improved people’s understanding of the value of mangrove forest. The ‘Impact on Safe and Just Operating Space’ framework and the associated indicators for effective implementation presented here, provide a novel, more all-encompassing approach for impact assessment of mangrove restoration and may well be applied to other nature-based solutions. This thesis manifests a trans-disciplinary perspective on the meaning of sustainability impact, engaging both field practitioners, various stakeholders, and the local community. Further research should provide a quantitative analysis of mangrove restoration potential on a local scale, including counteracting disservices.

AB  - To bring to fruition the capability of nature-based solutions (NBS) in mitigating hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs) and facilitate their widespread uptake require a consolidated knowledge-base related to their monitoring methods, efficiency, functioning and the ecosystem services they provide. We attempt to fill this knowledge gap by reviewing and compiling the existing scientific literature on methods, including ground-based measurements (e.g. gauging stations, wireless sensor network) and remote sensing observations (e.g. from topographic LiDAR, multispectral and radar sensors) that have been used and/or can be relevant to monitor the performance of NBS against five HMRs: floods, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion. These can allow the mapping of the risks and impacts of the specific hydro-meteorological events. We found that the selection and application of monitoring methods mostly rely on the particular NBS being monitored, resource availability (e.g. time, budget, space) and type of HMRs. No standalone method currently exists that can allow monitoring the performance of NBS in its broadest view. However, equipments, tools and technologies developed for other purposes, such as for ground-based measurements and atmospheric observations, can be applied to accurately monitor the performance of NBS to mitigate HMRs. We also focused on the capabilities of passive and active remote sensing, pointing out their associated opportunities and difficulties for NBS monitoring application. We conclude that the advancement in airborne and satellite-based remote sensing technology has signified a leap in the systematic monitoring of NBS performance, as well as provided a robust way for the spatial and temporal comparison of NBS intervention versus its absence. This improved performance measurement can support the evaluation of existing uncertainty and scepticism in selecting NBS over the artificially built concrete structures or grey approaches by addressing the questions of performance precariousness. Remote sensing technical developments, however, take time to shift toward a state of operational readiness for monitoring the progress of NBS in place (e.g. green NBS growth rate, their changes and effectiveness through time). More research is required to develop a holistic approach, which could routinely and continually monitor the performance of NBS over a large scale of intervention. This performance evaluation could increase the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NBS, and also create high levels of their acceptance and confidence by overcoming potential scepticism of NBS implementations.

AB  - Tidal wetlands provide important coastal protection, and interest in their restoration is growing in response to climate change. In Atlantic Canada, tidal wetland restoration has focused on restoring tidal flow, without planting vegetation. I evaluated five methods of planting eight native species at Bay of Fundy restoration sites by comparing growth and health of plants over two years. Planting potted seedlings facilitated the most growth of desired species and had 75% survival while plants transplanted from adjacent sites had higher mortality. Growth, health, and winter survival were all more strongly related to site than treatment. Important differences in elevation, inundation, salinity and soil nutrients may explain these differences in performance. These techniques show promise for accelerating re-vegetation at recovering sites, and my results highlight the need for an understanding of site conditions to inform planting schemes. Depending on budget, some combination of the tested planting techniques may be appropriate.

AB  - Tidal marshes often present cyclic dynamics, with alternating phases of expansion and lateral retreat. Marsh seedling establishment is a primary condition for marsh colonization and expansion. Successful establishment is often episodic due to bio-physical thresholds, as expressed in the ‘Windows of Opportunity’ concept. Identifying critical factors and understanding how they enable or hamper seedling establishment, is highly relevant for coastal management and restoration schemes. This study quantified the effects of critical factors in tidal marsh establishment processes. Firstly, by exposing marsh seedlings to different disturbances in terms of sedimentation regime and wave exposure, this study found that these disturbances affect seedling establishment both directly and via bio-morphological adjustments (Chapter 2 and 3). Secondly, channel related drainage relief was found to facilitate seedling survival, especially in the early phase of marsh establishment in muddy systems (Chapter 4). Thirdly, by using marsh seedlings with different disturbance-free periods in both laboratory and field experiments, this study confirmed that a longer disturbance-free period can strongly enhance seedling survival as well as their resistance to later extreme disturbances (Chapter 2 and 4). The erosion of tidal marshes often leads to the development of a cliff at the boundary between tidal flat and marsh. The formation of a cliff shifts marsh development from a phase of lateral expansion to a retreating phase, as a result of the interdependent feedbacks between marsh vegetation and external forcing. This thesis investigated the tipping point conditions of cliff formation at marsh edges with different marsh species. The clonal growth of vegetation at marsh edges was found to respond to different sediment types and to affect the cliff formation processes. Species-specific clonal growth strategies in step length have important effects on initiating cliffs, lateral retreat and thus landscape dynamics at marsh edges (Chapter 5). In summary, this study provides mechanistic insight into the primary expansion (i.e., seedling establishment) of tidal marshes under a variety of critical forcing factors, as well as insight in the factors contributing to cliff formation and the onset of lateral retreat. It highlights the variability in relevant species-specific responses, as well as the importance of location-dependent factors. These results add quantitative support to models predicting the critical transitions in marsh dynamics, both marsh expansion and marsh retreat. The findings of this study are instructive for marsh restoration and nature based coastal defense schemes. While they contribute to understanding the overall stability of marsh ecosystems in the face of global change, they also highlight the need for tailor-made solutions for the application of nature-based solutions at particular locations.

AB  - Tidal marshes are one of the world’s most economically valuable habitats; yet, they have experienced large and persistent declines globally. Increased knowledge of the ecosystem services delivered by marshes has become a powerful tool to conserve and restore them. But hesitancies regarding valuations and their application in decision-making remain. Here we draw on the literature and collective experience of participants in the “Concepts and controversies in tidal Marsh ecology revisited” workshop, November 2 and 3, 2019, Mobile, AL, to provide a concise snapshot of the current field of salt marsh ecosystem service valuation, discuss the possible risks in salt marsh valuation, and the importance of stakeholder engagement to mitigate them. We provide examples of the application of valuation in conservation-related decision-making, illustrating the growing operationalization of ecosystem services in incentivizing salt marsh conservation and restoration. Ecosystem service quantification and valuation is already playing an important role in decision-making by coastal risk managers, insurers, engineers, and policy makers. While there are legitimate criticisms of valuation techniques and remaining uncertainties in ecosystem service delivery that arise both through natural variability across space and time and through differing and shifting cultural values, our perspective is that the rise of big data, the development of valuation techniques, a growing understanding and application of environmental justice practices, and increasing interdisciplinarity to tackle these complex issues are paving the way for valuation to play a critical role in decision-making around salt marshes.

AB  - Tidal marshes and mangroves are increasingly valued for nature-based mitigation of coastal storm impacts, such as flooding and shoreline erosion hazards, which are growing due to global change. As this review highlights, however, hazard mitigation by tidal wetlands is limited to certain conditions, and not all hazards are equally reduced. Tidal wetlands are effective in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves, but long-period storm surges, which elevate sea levels up to several meters for up to more than a day, are attenuated less effectively, or in some cases not at all, depending on storm conditions, wetland properties, and larger-scale coastal landscape geometry. Wetlands often limit erosion, but storm damage to vegetation (especially mangrove trees) can be substantial, and recovery may take several years. Longer-term wetland persistence can be compromised when combined with other stressors, such as climate change and human disturbances. Due to these uncertainties, nature-based coastal defense projects need to adopt adaptive management strategies.

AB  - Through the use of various mechanisms, such as ecosystem evaluation tools, the costs and benefits of NI can be measured based on financial, environmental and social outcomes of investment. Generally, decision-makers choose among strategies by evaluating their return on investment, either over some finite time horizon (e.g., 20 years) or using net present value (McDonald, 2015). For instance, it has been found that a 10 per cent increase in forest cover near a watershed can decrease water treatment costs by 20 per cent (Ernst, Gullick, & Nixon, 2004; McDonald, 2015) and that the return on investment of the project is positive. Below we identify and present the main methodologies and data inputs that are available and required to carry out a systemic cost-benefit analysis and project financing assessment of NI assets.

AB  - Those who frequent the coastline may be accustomed to seeing driftwood washed onshore, some of it having seemingly found a home there for many years, others having been freshly deposited during the last set of storms; However, if a passerby were to take a closer look at the driftwood on the coastline, they may notice that some of these logs – also known as Large Woody Debris (LWD) – are anchored in place, a practice which is generally used for the purpose of stabilizing the shoreline or reducing wave-induced flooding. Records of existing anchored LWD project sites date back to 1997 and anecdotal evidence suggests that the technique has been used since the mid-1900’s in coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada, and Washington State, USA. Now, with an increased demand for natural and nature-based solutions, the technique is again gaining popularity. Despite this, the design of anchored LWD has largely been based on anecdotal observations and experience, as well as a continuity of design practices from the river engineering field. To date, there is no known peer-reviewed literature on the design or efficacy of LWD protection systems in a coastal environment. In 2019, the “Efficacy and Design of Coastal Protection using Large Woody Debris” research project was initiated to determine if LWD are effective at stabilizing the shoreline under wave action, if they are effective at reducing wave run-up, and if they are durable enough to meet engineering requirements for shore protection. In addition, the project aimed to determine the optimum configuration of LWD for design purposes. To meet these objectives, this study included the following work: (1) field studies of existing LWD installations, (2) experimental modeling of beach morphology with and without LWD structures, (3) experimental modeling of wave run-up with and without LWD structures, and (4) development of preliminary design guidance. The first phase of the project included field investigations at 15 existing anchored LWD sites in coastal BC and Washington State. Site characteristics, design techniques, and durability indicators were examined and correlated to a new design life parameter: ‘Effective Life’. Six primary installation techniques were observed: Single, Multiple, Benched, Stacked, Matrix, and Groyne. Observed durability and/or performance issues included: missing LWD, erosion, arson, wood decay, and anchor corrosion/damage. The Effective Life of anchored LWD was found to be strongly correlated to the tidal range and the upper beach slope for all installation types, and the LWD placement elevation relative to the beach crest elevation for single, shore-parallel structures. The many noted durability issues and ineffectiveness as mitigating erosion indicates that existing design methods for anchored LWD have not generally been effective at providing coastal protection and meeting engineering design life requirements. A comprehensive set of over 60 experimental tests were completed as part of the overall research program. Thirty-two (32) tests were analyzed as part of this study relating to the morphological response of a gravel beach with and without various LWD configurations. The tests were conducted within a wave flume at the National Research Council’s Ocean, Coastal and River Engineering Research Centre (NRC-OCRE), at a large scale (5:1) based on site characteristics and LWD design characteristics made during the previous field investigations. Tests were also conducted to assess experiment repeatability, sensitivity to test duration, sensitivity to wave height, wave period, and relative water level, influence of regular waves, and influence of log roughness. The position of the most seaward LWD (whether considering distance or elevation) was found to be strongly linked to morphological response. A theoretical relationship was developed between LWD elevation and sediment volume change. Configurations which included LWD placement below the still water level, such as the Benched configuration, were found to be most effective at stabilizing e beach profile. As part of the experimental modeling program, 24 tests were also conducted for the purpose of estimating the effect of LWD design configuration on wave run-up. In total, six different beach and LWD configurations were tested under a base set of four regular wave conditions. The study findings indicated that anchored LWD may increase wave run-up relative to a gravel beach with no structures. In particular, configurations with more logs tended to result in higher wave run-up. However, additional research is needed on the effect of LWD on wave run-up to confirm and expand these findings. There are a number of potential engineering, ecological, social, and economic benefits associated with anchored LWD installations if designed, installed, and monitored appropriately for the site conditions and user needs. To realize these potential benefits, significant additional research is needed on the topic. One of the most significant barriers to usage is a lack of information on how to effectively anchor LWD structures. However, this research project provides a baseline for future comprehensive studies on the effect and design of coastal protection using LWD. The project provides preliminary design considerations for the usage of LWD as coastal protection and contributes to the growing body of literature on nature-based solutions.

AB  - This white paper serves as input to an upcoming round of regional peer exchanges on nature‐based solutions, and constitutes an incremental step toward developing an implementation guide for using nature‐based solutions to improve the resilience of coastal highways to extreme events and sea level rise. Nature‐based solutions include a spectrum of natural and nature‐based features that serve as alternatives to, or ecological enhancements of, traditional shoreline stabilization and infrastructure protection techniques. In this case, the ability of nature‐based solutions to mitigate storm surge flooding, wave‐related damage, erosion, shoreline retreat, and the potential impacts of sea level rise is of interest. While nature‐based solutions have been used extensively across a diverse array of coastal settings, they are not commonly deployed within the transportation sector. In some cases, understanding of the engineering tools and methods for designing nature‐based solutions to achieve a specific outcome is lacking. This white paper addresses these issues by providing examples of nature‐based solutions and highlighting the best available science that describes their performance as solutions for coastal highways’ resilience. The implementation guide will be informed by the peer exchanges and will address the issues outlined here for the use of nature‐based solutions.

AB  - This volume examines the applicability of nature-based solutions in ecological restoration practice and in contemporary landscape architecture by bringing together ecology and architecture in the built environment. Green infrastructure is used to address urban challenges such as climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and stormwater management. In addition, thermal comfort nature-based solutions reintroduce critical connections between natural and urban systems. In light of ongoing developments in sustainable urban development, the goal is a paradigm shi4 towards a landscape that restores and rehabilitates urban ecosystems. The ten contributions to this book examine a wide range of successful cases of designing healthier, greener and more resilient landscapes in different geographical contexts, from the United States of America and Brazil, through various European regions, to Singapore and China. While some chapters attempt to conceptualize the interconnections between cities and nature, others clearly have an empirical focus. Therefore, this volume provides a rich body of work and acts as a starting point for further studies on restoration of ecosystems and integrative policies such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The analysed data indicates a reduction of both wave height and wave velocities due to the presence of the meadow, however the revision of the literature highlights the complexity of introducing it as a nature based solution, giving more importance to a correct management of the life cycle of the seagrass rather than on habitat creation projects.

AB  - This study investigates where coastal green infrastructure (CGI) can provide highest potential coastal protection benefits, while considering its vulnerability to environmental conditions. CGI provides important coastal protection benefits, however, influenced by climate change and human activities, these benefits are highly threatened. This vulnerability of CGI was not considered in the previous studies. This study provides a framework and an indicator-based methodology to fill this gap. A review of the literature was conducted to identify the parameters used to measure CGI's coastal protection benefits and vulnerability. The content of the references that contained specific parameters related to CGI's role in coastal protection and vulnerability were systematically reviewed. A total of 11 indicators were identified and organized into two indices: CGI coastal protection index, and CGI vulnerability index. The indices were synthesized using a 2 × 2 matrix to identify areas with the highest coastal protection potential. Analysis was conducted for the 74 most populated coastal communities in the Salish Sea region. Results indicate that the British Columbia communities in the Salish Sea region have high potential to utilize CGI for coastal protection. CGI in 59% of the communities in British Columbia and 36% in Washington State can provide high coastal protection benefits, even when vulnerability is accounted for.

AB  - This study assesses changes in coastal risk reduction and adaptation-labelled responses in Mauritius Island since the 1960s. Using research documents, interviews, field observations, image analysis, and case studies, it analyses evolutions in public and private stakeholders’ strategies, and the levers and barriers at play. Based on 60 beach sites, it reveals the prevalence (76.7%) of hard protection compared with no response (8.3%), ecosystem-based responses (3.3%), and combined responses (11.7%) and a nation-wide shift from hard and one-size-fits-all responses to soft and place-specific responses. This shift was driven by the failure of initial hard protection measures, which has pushed the Government of Mauritius to improve beach management practices, promote retreat where hard protection had failed, resort to external expertise and funding to design a well-informed risk reduction and adaptation policy, and implement demonstration projects. The “learning-by-doing” process and increased external support have thus allowed progress in risk reduction and adaptation at publicly managed beach sites. In contrast, privately managed (i.e. by residents and hotel companies) beach sites often exhibit increased risks, as a result of the proliferation of uncoordinated technical interventions, related cascading (beach loss, spread of coastal erosion downdrift), and lock-in effects. This study provides guidance for the ground-rooted and systematic analysis of coastal risk reduction and adaptation responses and their drivers at the local and national scale. It could serve as a first basis for framing nation-wide assessments aimed at taking stock of recent progress in coastal risk reduction and adaptation worldwide and help overcome barriers to adaptation.

AB  - This study assessed the effectiveness of Nature-based Solutions in reducing flood risk in the Galveston Bay, Texas (USA), by means of wave attenuation. The energy-dissipating mechanisms of marsh vegetation, seagrass meadows, and oyster reefs were described and assessed quantitatively with a numerical model. The effectiveness and limitations of the Nature-based Solutions, as well as potential optimization strategies were investigated for the Galveston Bay. Marsh vegetation was found to be most effective in reducing the wave height at the northern shore of Galveston Island, but stem breakage may become a dominant mechanism during extreme storm condition. Oyster reefs are effective at reducing wave height in relatively shallow waters like the Galveston Bay, provided that their location is close to the intended area of wave height reduction. They are especially effective in moderate storm conditions. Seagrass meadows do not significantly attenuate storm waves.

AB  - This study aims at documenting the value chain derived from mangrove forests in selected sites in central Mozambique (Zambezi Delta, Nhangau and Chiveve River), through the identification of the services delivered by mangrove forests and assessment of stakeholder’s engagement within the value chain. Furthermore, this work evaluates the income pathways as well as the current and potential benefits of different stakeholders and the socio-economic sustainability of mangroves in the three regions. Zambezi Delta is one of largest mangrove swamps in Africa and Chiveve is located in Beira City, impacted by Cyclone Idai in 2019. The main benefits obtained by the communities both in the Zambezi Delta and Nhangau were derived from commercially important wood extraction and honey production for domestic use. Within the Zambezi Delta, profit for small mangrove poles accrued at the wholesale level (82.6%), while that for large poles accrued to harvesters (125.0%), after a small initial direct investment. At Nhangau, small poles fetched profits of 17%, medium poles 11.5%, and large poles 24%; for charcoal, the greatest portion of profits went to retailers at 50%. Men were mostly involved in mangrove wood harvesting for commercial purposes, while women collected firewood mainly for domestic use. At the Chiveve, the community benefited predominantly from non-extractable services such as flooding control, water purification, nursery grounds for fisheries and aesthetic beauty. It is suggested that Mozambique mangrove forests are valued at USD 2 400 per hectare per year. This monetary accounting can be used to inform decision making on mangrove management and to improve the performance of the value chain and the wellbeing of local communities.

AB  - This research aims at discussing the role of environmental planning, its progress to date and the challenges that arise, all while focusing on coastal cities. In the context of the integrated environmental planning on the coastal front of the cities, it is considered necessary to adopt the protect - accommodate - retreat target. For this purpose, various alternative protective methods and projects are examined, as well as their applicability and degree of acceptance today. The exploitation of natural infrastructure is presented as a relevant alternative to the traditional methods of engineered solutions and mechanical shielding of the coastal front, as protective measures. Currently, there is scientific consensus on the use of natural infrastructure for coastal protection as an innovative and flexible method, easily adaptable to the local conditions, securing additional environmental benefits for the city. In coastal cities, these methods are also employed to tackle challenges and weaknesses resulting from their nature, as ecosystems face additional pressures due to their location within an urban environment. Most coastal cities using natural infrastructure are in the regions of Southeast Asia and the USA. Regarding hybrid approaches of coastal protection, New York appears to be the first city to have developed and implemented such hybrid methods. The research concludes that although natural infrastructure appears to be the desired and more sustainable solution for the protection of cities’ coastal front, the implementation of hybrid systems, i.e. the combination of engineered projects and natural infrastructure, is considered more feasible. When choosing hybrid systems, already constructed engineered projects are utilized, benefits of both methods are exploited, while the existence of a “double line” of defense increases the levels of protection of the coastal front and integrates smoothly the water element within the city.

AB  - This report provides an overview of the storm impacts during the Northwest Monsoon season of 2019 in Seychelles. Two storms in December 2019 caused severe overtopping and erosion impacts in the islands of Mahe and Praslin. The events were associated to a swell generated by a depression in the Indian Ocean, the first one of which later strengthened to become Cyclone Berna in the western Indian Ocean. This storm was followed by another one that coincided with even higher tide levels and also produced flooding and erosion impacts. The storms produced flooding and substantial erosion of sandy beaches, damage to the vegetation line and caused widespread damages to sea walls, rock armoring, road infrastructure, hotels and properties. Wave action atop high sea level conditions during December 2019 were the plausible causes of most of the observed severe beach erosion and impacts. The flooding levels would have at least exceeded 2 m above mean sea level during these storms. The most impacted areas were northwest and north Praslin and northwest Mahe, including in Praslin: Cote D’Or, Anse la Blague, Anse Lazio, Anse Kerlan, Grand Anse, among others; and in Mahe: Beau Vallon and North East Point. Wave modeling results for the storms in December 2019 and those during the Southeast Monsoon season indicate substantial differences in the coastlines affected depending on storm conditions. The wave modeling results also explain the impacts based on the direction and intensity of wave action in areas with the highest observed impacts: north and northwest Praslin and Northwest of Mahe. The quantification of the economic damage caused by the storms would need further analysis. However, it is estimated that over 1,000 buildings and 27 hotels are located within areas that were affected by flooding and by erosion, which are at higher risk since these storms. The recommendations are aligned with the priorities identified in the Coastal Management Plan 2019-2022, which include investments in infrastructure and nature-based solutions for coastal protection as well as increased attention to capacity building of the implementing agencies responsible for coastal protection in Seychelles. This impact assessment report should be considered supplementary to the Coastal Management Plan.

AB  - This report presents innovations from academia and practice designed to green grey infrastructure assets such as bridges, street furniture and coastal engineering structures that need to remain primarily grey for their essential function. We call this integrated green grey infrastructure (IGGI). We collated material on these innovations and assessed them using a critical success factors (CSF) framework that we –co-developed with a team of practitioners in government agencies and companies to help better evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of using IGGI measures compared to traditional grey engineering solutions. The CSF framework is outlined and demonstrated by assessing the engineering performance and ecosystem services benefits of ecological enhancements used in specific operational scale case studies. The case studies presented in this report show that simple, inexpensive ecological enhancement and green engineering solutions can deliver more multifunctional benefits than business as usual solutions for similar or reduced costs. These ecological enhancements and green engineering options have been compiled and assessed for historic conservation areas, urban areas, estuaries and at the coast. This report is intended to support asset managers, engineers, conservation and biodiversity teams, decision-makers, and other end-users to help them better identify IGGI options and evaluate these against business as usual grey engineering approaches.

The key philosophy of BwN is the employment of natural processes to serve societal goals, such as flood safety. The starting point is a systems-based approach, making interventions that employ the shaping forces of the natural system to perform measures by self-regulation. Initial pilots of this innovative approach originate from coastal engineering, with the Sand Motor along the coast of South Holland as one of the prime examples. From here, the BwN approach has evolved into a new generation of nature-based hydraulic solutions, such as mangrove forests, coastal reefs, and green dikes.

AB  - This policy brief highlights key challenges that must be addressed for the long-term sustainability of the global seaweed industry, ensuring its role in providing nature-based solutions within the sustainable ocean economy agenda and in contributing to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021 – 2030). Seaweed production has grown rapidly over the past 50 years. It currently accounts for over 50 % of total global marine production, equating to ~35 million tonnes. In 2019, the industry’s total value was estimated at USD 14.7 billion. The seaweed value chain supports the livelihoods of approximately 6 million small-scale farmers and processors, both men and women, many of whom live in coastal communities in low- and middle-income countries. The aquaculture sector is increasingly interested in seaweed because of its potential for greater use in food, food supplements, animal feed, fertiliser and biostimulants, and in alternatives to fossil fuels and their derived products, such as plastics. Its cultivation can help restore degraded environments, increase ocean biodiversity and mitigate the effects of climate change and coastal acidification by capturing carbon and other nutrients. In low-, middle- and high-income countries, the seaweed industry has a wide-ranging potential to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular, SDG 14 (life below water), SDG13 (climate action), SDG6 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG5 (gender equality). The global seaweed industry, however, faces significant challenges. For future sustainability, improvements are urgently needed in biosecurity and traceability, pest and disease identification and outbreak reporting, risk analysis to prevent transboundary spread, the establishment of high quality, disease-free seed-banks and nurseries and the conservation of genetic diversity in wild stocks. These improvements require technological innovation, capacity building and effective gender-responsive and co-ordinated policies, incentives and regulations. They will need to enhance occupational safety, whilst increasing the industry’s resilience to the impacts of climate change and production hazards, such as pest and disease outbreaks. To align with the SDGs, particular attentions will need to be paid to small scale farmers and processors to ensure that the globalisation of seaweed aquaculture supports the development of sustainable, resilient and inclusive livelihoods.

AB  - This policy brief examines the existing Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and ratified National Determined Contributions (NDCs) with regard to the inclusion of specific efforts addressing blue carbon ecosystems, namely mangroves, tidal saltmarshes and seagrasses, as climate mitigation or adaptation solutions. Prior to and during the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 163 INDCsi have been submitted and 81 Parties have submitted their NDC 1,2. The INDCs are meant to outline Parties’ fair and ambitious contributions to addressing climate change and achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 and further strengthened in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement. Amongst other information, Parties were requested to include information on the scope and coverage of their mitigation and adaptation efforts, as well as on methodological approaches including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals.3 As part of the Paris Agreement, Parties are now committed to regularly submit revised NDCs every 5 years, with a review process that is intended to continually increase ambition (Art 4.3 and 4.9 of the Paris Agreement). For the time being, the INDCs submitted by a country prior and during COP21 will automatically count as its first NDC when the country ratifies the Paris Agreement, unless decided otherwise.4 While the current NDCs are a significant contribution, the existing commitments will not reach the 2°C target necessary to combat climate change. Scientists have calculated that the NDCs collectively will lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but will still allow for a warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.5 This reality is recognized in the Paris Agreement, and this policy briefs aims to highlight the opportunity for countries to consider nature- based solutions beyond what was originally submitted, including recognizing blue carbon as an opportunity to fill this emissions gap. This brief outlines how Parties have up until now included and addressed the management of coastal wetland (blue carbon) ecosystems in their NDC climate mitigation and adaptation solutions to date. It also offers a short outlook on areas where coastal wetlands contributions can be improved and strengthened in the future, allowing for more ambitious NDC submissions. In many coastal nations these ecosystems provide a significant mitigation and adaptation value, as a carbon sink and as coastline protection and food security, respectively. Thus, the inclusion of coastal ecosystems can be considered an important asset in a more ambitious revision of the NDC for many Parties.

AB  - This paper studied the interactions between mangroves and water waves through laboratory experiments. Using 1:7 scale 3D-printed trees based on the scanned image of a typical Rhizophora species, we replicated the root structure of natural mangroves and constructed a model forest. Three arrangements of mangrove models, two model forests of different stem densities and a single tree in isolation, were adopted. To investigate the relationships between mangrove resistance and waves, we applied the approach of direct force measurement, measuring wave forces on mangrove models, fluid velocity, and free surface elevation along the wave flume. Testing regular and solitary waves of various conditions, we observed non-negligible inertia effects in the measured forces. Based on the direct measurements, we estimated drag and inertia coefficients in the Morison-type equation (Morison et al., 1950, https://doi.org/10.2118/950149-g) and established empirical relationships between the two coefficients and Reynolds and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers. These relationships of drag and inertia coefficients can be used in mathematical/numerical simulations to parameterize mangrove effects under similar scale conditions. Compared to previous studies, the drag coefficients for mangroves were more scattered than rigid cylinders, especially in shallower water depths. By testing different water depths, we observed different patterns of drag and inertia coefficients when the root system was partially or fully submerged. In addition, the fluctuating fluid velocity and enhanced turbulence kinetic energy at the vertical positions near prop roots indicated the blockage effects and the shear-induced turbulence due to the complex root structure. These findings suggested the influence of mangrove roots on water waves.

The focus groups’ purpose was to better understand local coastal professionals’ and decision-makers’ (e.g., natural resource managers, community planners, extension and outreach specialists) views on mitigation options for coastal hazards (e.g., storm surge, nuisance flooding, sea level rise) including use of natural and nature-based features (NNBF; e.g., sand dunes, living shorelines, oyster reefs). Overall, results revealed that participants were aware of various mitigation options, had favorable views toward NNBF infrastructure, and perceived five major benefits and six major barriers or challenges with such approaches. Designing and implementing NNBF infrastructure was perceived as complex and requiring several types of ecological and socioeconomic considerations and information for decision-making. We conclude with a discussion of findings, practical implications for coastal resilience planning and management, and recommendations for future research.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a collaborative planning process to develop an integrated coastal restoration plan for Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana that recognizes the knowledge, experience, and priorities of residents and local stakeholders. To achieve this goal, the research team convened a broad group of stakeholders who live and work in Plaquemines Parish, including representatives of the seafood, navigation, and oil and gas industries, as well as residents, landowners, and those who are indigenous to the region, all of whom rely upon the ecosystem services provided by the wetlands, bays, and waterways for sustenance and wellbeing. Using a combination of local knowledge mapping and participatory modeling, the group worked with scientists to develop a restoration plan consisting of a suite of interlinked natural and nature-based solutions. The approach was intentionally interactive and iterative, creating a venue for open dialogue between residents, scientists, and resource users where no one source of knowledge was given primacy over another. Residents were able to contribute information regarding coastal restoration planning within their own communities, and a consensus plan for prioritizing restoration efforts in clusters was submitted for consideration as part of the State of Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan process. Providing local stakeholders with direct access to scientists allowed their local knowledge to be translated into data products that could be more readily ingested into numerical models and other scientific planning tools.

AB  - This paper investigates the documentation produced by 21 Horizon 2020 (H2020) projects for the use of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) for climate change adaptation (NBaS). Accordingly, an updated state-of-the-art on current knowledge and its limits is presented. Findings are then capitalized on for highlighting research needs. The main objective of this study is to inform future orientations on NBaS research. Accordingly, it can be considered as an effort to complement the 2021 European strategy for climate change adaptation, under which NBaS is listed as one of the three cross-cutting priorities. The obtained results reflect actual outcomes from completed projects, while ongoing projects provided a substantial amount of relevant knowledge. From the exhaustive knowledge-research need inventory, one of the most significant identified gaps was the need for developing further the fundamental scientific basis behind these solutions, as the concept favors its practical nature and places less emphasis on its scientific counterpart.

AB  - This paper investigates how nature is transformed into infrastructure through an examination of New York State’s Living Breakwaters project, a $60 million risk management experiment to grow oyster reefs in order to better govern storm surge, rising seas, and coastal flooding. While oysters’ infrastructural nature is portrayed by designers and planners as an inherent natural property which now simply needs harnessing, in reality making oysters into infrastructure requires extensive concrete work—by humans and oysters. Drawing on historical research, site observation, interviews, and media and design analysis, this article traces this work required to make oysters appear, and then function, as a risk management solution. In part one, I trace the narrative work involved in establishing the idea of oysters as infrastructure. In part two, I look at what it takes to build this idea in reality, to make oysters actually function within desired governmental parameters. Making oysters into infrastructure, I conclude, is a kind of biopolitics, both in the traditional sense of making certain forms of human life live, but also in which the goal is to make nature live in a particular way, albeit one imagined as natural to the oyster. While biopolitics forwards a dystopian view of human and nonhumans as vulnerable to threatening environmental processes and heavily secured, it may be undermined by the inability to make nature’s imagined “vitality” appear.

AB  - This paper investigates how mangrove foreshores can be integrated into embankment designs in Bangladesh. The effect of mangroves on surges has already been studied for the design conditions of Bangladesh. However, the impact of wave attenuation by mangroves on embankment designs is not known. A model is thus developed to estimate the wave height reduction by a mangrove forest, and how such wave attenuation would influence the design of a landward embankment. Model simulations suggest that mangrove belts with a width between 100 and 1,000 meters (perpendicular to the coast) could provide wave attenuation rates between 7 and 55 percent (compared to a situation without mangroves) at potential afforestation sites identified in previous studies. Such wave attenuation rates would reduce the embankment height by 0.09–0.30 meters, diminish the slope revetment thickness by 13–46 percent, and decrease the wave shear stresses at the embankment toe up to 25–70 percent. Relatively wider mangrove belts not only cause a larger reduction of the embankment design requirements, but also host larger biodiversity and are more resilient against pests and extreme events. The model results are highly sensitive to the mangrove properties, and collecting data on the local mangrove species is recommended to reduce uncertainty in the predictions. Moreover, the results also suggest that trees older than 10–20 years might collapse during storms. Expanding the mangrove stability model, including other pioneer species in the analysis, and exploring the option of canopy pruning are thus advised to ensure the integrity of any future afforestation efforts. Overall, this paper provides a methodology that could be applied to design nature-based solutions in Bangladesh.

AB  - This paper explores financial tools for investing in natural infrastructure to reduce current and future risks from flooding. The key conclusions are: 1. There is a large and growing pool of funding for natural infrastructure, but the availability is geographically uneven and providing sufficient resources will require significant actions by industry, government, scientists, and communities.  There are both public and private sources that can fund natural infrastructure for flood risk reduction. Approaches vary among the U.S., Europe, and international development organizations. For example, funding for natural flood control infrastructure is a byproduct of other purposes in the U.S., but recognized as a specific purpose in Europe and by development organizations.  The opportunities for investments in natural infrastructure are shaped by various factors, including local geography, type and extent of ecosystems, knowledge about local flood risks, approaches to funding ecosystem conservation, the capacity of financing systems, and the socioeconomic status of communities.  The types and amounts of funding for natural infrastructure can be expected to grow because of innovations such as catastrophe bonds, but current institutional structures are often ill-suited to take advantage of existing and emerging opportunities and are not prepared to meet increasing risk.

AB  - This paper examines the recreational use values associated with a coastal walking trail under threat from increased episodes of storm surges and coastal erosion, and the cost of alternative grey and nature based infrastructure options that could protect it. These options involve restoring an oyster reef bar that would act as a natural breakwater versus an impermeable revetment. The results of an on-site survey of users of the amenity and a negative binomial travel cost model demonstrate that the coastal trail has considerable recreational use value to local communities. In terms of a cost benefit analysis it was found that both protection options resulted in a positive net benefit over a 20 year time horizon but the nature based solution had a benefit cost ratio multiple times larger than the grey infrastructure alternative. The conclusions of the analysis remain valid under sensitivity analysis. The results suggest a compelling case for embedding nature based solutions in climate adaption and flood management planning for low lying coastal areas where recreational resources are under threat as it can be not only more cost effective but may also offer other ecosystem benefits to coastal communities.

The paper assembles a regionwide panel dataset that measures local economic activity using nightlights, potential hurricane damages using a detailed wind field model, and mangrove protection by mapping the width of mangrove forests on the path to the coast. The results show that hurricanes have negative short-run effects on economic activity, with losses likely concentrated in coastal lowlands that are exposed to both wind and storm surge hazards. In these coastal lowlands, the estimates show that nightlights decrease by up to 24% in areas that are unprotected by mangroves. By comparison, the impact of the hurricanes observed in the sample is fully mitigated in areas protected by mangrove belts of 1 km or more.

AB  - This paper discusses three scientific frontiers that need to be advanced in order to support decision-makers and practitioners in charge of operational decisions and action on the design and implementation of concrete adaptation policies and actions. These frontiers refer to going beyond the (1) incremental vs. transformational and (2) maladaptation vs. adaptation dichotomies and to advancing knowledge on (3) adaptation measures’ effectiveness and roles in designing context-specific adaptation pathways. Dealing with adaptation to climate change on the ground often means answering three obvious but critical questions: what to do, where and when? These questions challenge the scientific community’s capacity to link conceptual advances (e.g. on transformative adaptation) and ground-rooted needs across sectors and regions (on solutions, governance arrangements, etc.). We argue that the three abovementioned frontiers represent the most burning challenges to the Adaptation Science community to help addressing climate-related societal needs. We also demonstrate that they are intertwined as moving one frontier forward will facilitate moving the others forward.

AB  - This paper describes the development and application of an approach to adapt the existing flood defences along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast to the effects of climate change and sea level rise in the context of other uncertainties and developments. It starts with the development of a dike-portfolio with traditional as well as new flood protection concepts. Next these concepts are evaluated by means of a multi-criteria analysis by local experts. The objective is to identify realistic adaptation options that use or enable natural processes to strengthen ecological resilience and facilitate sustainable human use in the Wadden region. In our analyses Eco-engineering concepts (in rural areas) as well as a Multifunctional dike (in built-up areas) received the highest scores. Multifunctional dikes are robust and offer space for other functions and values. However, their performance in an integral assessment strongly depends on the applied functions and the weight per evaluation criterion. Eco-engineering concepts can potentially contribute to nature and landscape values, but implementation may lead to tension with nature legislation. For the Wadden Sea landscape, which is characterised by the presence of semi-natural salt marshes, the application of vegetated foreshores for flood protection comes forward as being particularly attractive. For every specific stretch of the 227 km long coastline the study has identified the most promising dike concept. The result of this study has been adopted by the national government and the regional water boards as a basis for more detailed analysis and design per stretch of coast. Additional modelling studies and cost benefit analyses will be required at this stage to verify the outcome of our studies and to optimise the design.

The aim is to examine characteristics of wave transmission in connection with conditions favourable for mangrove rehabilitation in the Mekong River Delta. Across-structure wave energy balance and exchange of fine sediment were examined in comparison with several existing types of permeable breakwaters. It is shown that porous-type structures like the OCT breakwater are more advantageous over hollow-type ones and are generally recommended for use in favour of mangrove re-colonization.

AB  - This paper analyzes the determinants of economic growth in coastal economies with the purpose of highlighting the impact of human activity pressure on mangrove blue carbon (BC). We use a Bayesian Model Averaging-based estimation technique to fit alternative growth theories to 1960-2009 data on a BC sample of 23 coastal countries and a worldwide (WW) sample of 83 countries. In addition to having high mangrove blue carbon climate change mitigation potential, a representative country from the BC sample possesses features commonly associated with developing countries. Moreover, such a country’s natural capital per capita has decreased by more than 50% during the half-century span of our data and its dependence on natural capital is almost twice as high as that of its WW counterpart. We find that the neoclassical theory, through income and investment in physical capital, demography, macroeconomic policy, and natural capital theories perform well in explaining growth in BC countries. In contrast, investment in physical capital and proxies for the macroeconomic policy and natural capital theories are found not to be good predictors of growth when using the WW sample of countries. These results put the finger on the critical problem of existing and potential anthropogenic pressure that coastal areas with BC are and can be subject to due to land conversion for agriculture, aquaculture, farming and other run-offs, marine resources exploitation, uncontrolled sewage, marine resources direct exploitation, and coastal constructions and public works related to natural capital exports. This admittedly grim picture of the coasts draws attention to at least two policy questions, namely, whether central governments ought to give local policy makers and communities incentives to promote nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and the extent to which international financial institutions should provide financial support for such initiatives in developing countries.

AB  - This paper aims to explore how resilience to climate change can be achieved and optimised within an example of a complex, high-vulnerability and low-elevation coastal zone. In Uist, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, a completed INTERREG project provided a framework for resilience planning in a complex, multifaceted environment, where official bodies, NGOs, academics and the community already work together productively. A range of approaches to coping with climate change in Uist is reviewed, some of these originating from within the community, and the local situation is discussed in the context of the extent to which resilience theory and national policy intertwine. These approaches identify and combine nature-based solutions and compatible engineering-based solutions, demonstrating how resilience can be achieved and enhanced in a vulnerable area via sustained engagement with local communities backed by peer-reviewed research and complying with the policy context.

AB  - This Major Paper is on the global governance of climate change through nature-based solutions (NbS). It explores how nature-based solutions (NbS) support the realization of the 1.5-2°C target of the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the global environmental and societal goals reflected in the UN 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goals and under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. To do so it first reviews the evolution of the conceptualization of the term NbS from 2008 to the present. From here it conducts a scoping review of the NbS literature, with a focus on climate change and governance. It presents the key governance opportunities, barriers and challenges, and recommendations for overcoming these challenges that the peer-reviewed literature emphasizes. The overarching takeaway inferred from this review is that due to nature’s inherent multifunctionality and cost-effectiveness, NbS can be highly effective for meeting global climate and societal goals if NbS implementation is guided by sound global principles and standards that allow for the use of a range of regionally or locally-appropriate assessment frameworks based on best practices, and if multilevel and multi-actor collaborative governance is modelled. In this event, NbS can be a powerful approach with wide-reaching effects for emissions abatement and resilient and sustainable societies. In all, this Major Paper explores how NbS can help build a holistic and more equitable society and future, alongside commonly used terms such as technical- and market-based solutions.

AB  - This document summarises outcomes from the EC individual expert reports delivered through its ‘Valorisation of NBS Projects’ initiative. EU research and innovation projects were scanned for results pertaining to key areas such as biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation (including flooding), water quality, air quality and microclimate, sustainable communities, innovative governance and business models, and market challenges and solutions. Evidence from the reviewed projects (and the EC’s NBS policy topic area) is framed within knowledge from the wider literature, to give as full a picture as possible about the state of the art. Contextualised information is provided on policy developments, research results and key lessons. The resulting evidence base includes figures and monetary values showing the relative cost-effectiveness of NBS, and exploring how they support policy implementation. Policy recommendations and knowledge gaps are also highlighted to support the strengthening of strategies and practical action for the uptake of NBS, to deliver targeted and efficient interventions to help solve societal challenges in Europe and beyond.

AB  - This discussion paper aims to provide information to the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) on NbS to understand more about the principles upon which NbS are based for sustainable agriculture and food systems. This research also aims to contribute to an operational framework that could guide applications of NbS on different regions in the world and at different scales, as well to provide relevant scientific material for the development of future policy guidelines. Desktop research was conducted through literature review and using secondary data. NbS case studies for food production implemented in the Netherlands, in Europe, and in the global south (Latin America, Africa, and Asia) were collected and reviewed. This discussion paper is organized in the following way: Firstly, definitions, principles and concepts of NbS are explained in section 2. Moreover, section 3 is about the application of NbS for food security and circularity under climate change conditions. Case studies from the Netherlands, Europe and the global south are mentioned. Section 4 explains the drivers, opportunities, and hindering factors for the successful implementation of NbS in different socio-ecological and climatic contexts. NbS across different scales are described in section 5 with reference to different case studies. Section 6 relates to the factors that support multi-stakeholders’ participation, the available NbS tools and data, along with the description of business models to jointly explore the potential for NbS applications. We then turn to present our conclusions and recommendations addressed in section 7.

AB  - This chapter summarizes and expands on a research roundtable co-sponsored by the IUCN Horseshoe Crab Specialist Group, Nature Society (Singapore), and the Mangrove Action Project during the 2016 IUCN World Congress in Honolulu, Hawaii. Our central premise is that horseshoe crabs can serve as a flagship species for the conservation and restoration of several ecologically significant nearshore habitats, including estuarine beaches, mangroves, salt marshes, and tidal flats, all of which are being lost or degraded from coastal development and climate change. Horseshoe crabs are suitable as a flagship species because of their importance as a “living fossil,” their role in the nearshore food web, and their significant economic importance. Workshop participants from North America and Asia highlighted case histories and discussed the ways that horseshoe crab science and public education can join together to promote coastal marine conservation.

AB  - This chapter seeks to articulate future directions in the field of Eco-DRR/CCA, in the context of the new post-2015 sustainable development agenda. It synthesises the experiences featured in this book and highlights the key challenges and opportunities in advancing Eco-DRR/CCA approaches. Four main themes are discussed: demonstrating the economic evidence of Eco-DRR/CCA; decision-making tools for Eco-DRR/CCA; innovative institutional arrangements and policies for mainstreaming Eco-DRR/CCA; and research gaps. The major global policy agreements in 2015 are examined for their relevance in promoting Eco-DRR/CCA implementation in countries. Finally, the authors reflect on a new agenda for Eco-DRR/CCA and outline some of the key elements required to significantly advance and scale-up Eco-DRR/CCA implementation globally.

AB  - This chapter puts into conversation two distinct yet interrelated planning visions – Blue Urbanism as a movement in its own right. driven by the overarching promise of more meaningfully reconnecting coastal cities with their marine ecosystems, and Nature-based solutions, with roots in engineering that encompass a broad range of conservationist and infrastructural interventions rooted in Euro-American sensibilities around (urban) nature. Drawing on urban Southeast Asia for inspiration, namely Jakarta, Metro Manila and Singapore, the chapter unpicks dominant understandings of “nature” within its concomitant planning paradigms. Particular attention is placed on divergent meanings and contradictions that underpin how urban coastal nature(s) are materially imagined, reproduced and contested through often technical means, utilitarian value-systems, and modes of governing adaptation in its broadest sense.

AB  - This chapter provides a brief historical review of nature-based solutions (NBS) to address increasing climate extremes in urban areas and their surroundings, tracing their historical evolution to their current moment as du jour solutions to multiple crises. We review how this term has evolved through multiple iterations used across sectors and its current ubiquity in global policy discussion forums like the United Nations (UN) Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), due to its potential as a “swiss knife” to meet multiple global goals in climate, sustainable development, and biodiversity. We evaluate the gaps between the ubiquity of NBS in current geopolitical discourses around urban resilience and sustainability and actual implementation in cities around the world. While countries are increasingly committing to NBS and similar approaches in national climate commitments, lacking data, technical capacity, and funding continue to limit implementation beyond relatively marginal projects insufficient to shifting worsening trends in climate change and biodiversity loss. We close with four guiding principles for addressing these gaps, emphasizing the importance of connectivity and scale, assessing the direct effects of climate change on potential NBS performance, quantification and valuation, and the powerful job-creation potential of NBS in creating resilience to multiple crises, including the current global recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This chapter presents the co-development of the Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) planning process in the Vouga estuary for the mitigation of unintended impacts on biodiversity resulting from the 2019/2020 management plan. This estuary, part of Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon located on the north-west coast of Portugal (40°38′N, 08°45′W), connects the Vouga river catchment area to the Atlantic Ocean. Ria de Aveiro, part of the Natura 2000 network, is characterised by high biodiversity and a wide range of ecosystem services. However, it is also a vulnerable territory that requires a management plan in practice for environmental protection, targeting threatened species and habitats, but also to enable socio-economic welfare. Framed by EBM principles, the stepwise planning approach aimed at identifying the governance boundaries and institutions, the policy objectives, synergies, and gaps relevant to managing biodiversity, and to promote participatory actions with local stakeholders and policy-makers to understand their objectives. These three first steps enabled us to understand the social-ecological system and to co-develop relevant EBM solutions. In the final step, the proposed EBM solutions were evaluated for effectiveness, efficiency, equity and fairness, and then compared to the present condition. The co-developed solutions target science, policy and stakeholders interfaces. Namely, scientific knowledge applied to restore saltmarshes and seagrasses, policy objectives harmonising monitoring across EU Directives and integrate territorial management instruments, and management process involving stakeholders throughout.

AB  - This chapter outlines a conceptual framework to analyze the different roles that the insurance sector can play in relation to nature-based solutions (NBS) and to build resilience in the context of climate change and probable increased level of damages, considering the potential to mitigate water risks as eco-DRR and climate change adaptation. It introduces the concepts of assurance and insurance value of nature to then analyze the different roles (what we have termed the “five hats”) of the insurance sector, illustrating these different opportunities to engage the insurance sector into NBS to risk mitigation and adaptation with reference to concrete examples. The roles refer to (re)insurance as data owners, as investors, as innovators, and as insurance partners for managing risk to ensure the resilience and insurability of the system (including natural systems).

AB  - This chapter examines the blue economy concept and discusses the increasing and cumulative challenges that require integrated solutions and finance approaches. It describes the broader sustainable finance landscape before identifying a number of specific innovative finance approaches that can be applied to develop a sustainable blue economy. Innovative finance is based on the premise that traditional funding from taxpayers of public goods and delivery entirely through public services alongside purely commercial finance for private business are on their own insufficient to deliver the required transition at the necessary scale and speed and level of technology. Strong nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement that cover ocean goals, marine spatial plans with ecosystem protection for resilience and biodiversity that engage all stakeholders and adequate ecosystem-based management mandates are a prerequisite to attracting long-term sustainable financing into sub-Saharan Africa's blue economy. Sub-Saharan African economies will need to proactively target sustainable blue economy using innovative finance to build sustainable marine and coastal economies.

It discusses the general transition in coastal protection policy in the Netherlands and the main challenges in implementing Building with Nature as a coastal protection strategy in the Netherlands. Dutch national government relies on engineering tools such as numerical models, field data analysis, and expert judgment for assessing coastal safety and designing mitigation measures for coastal erosion. Pilot projects and field studies are an ideal means to facilitate interdisciplinary coastal research to increase predictability of coastal systems. The most frequently quoted ecosystem services of salt marshes are storm protection for coastal communities, shoreline stabilization, nutrient removal, carbon sequestration, fisheries, and recreation. The first coastal protection measures inspired by the Building with Nature philosophy now become visible in the Dutch landscape.

Coastal bioengineers utilize these environmental and engineering parameters to design living shoreline techniques to achieve the success criteria of the given project. Environmental parameters may also include more physical parameters related to the biology, such as tolerance of a target species to tidal inundation, soil salinity, and wave energy. The coastal bioengineer must consider not only the environmental parameters discussed above but also the engineering parameters related to the location and the individual components of the living shoreline project. The intention of living shoreline techniques is to develop nature-based protective infrastructure. Coastal bioengineering can contribute to living shorelines by providing a combination of engineering design for materials and structures, with awareness and prediction of growth needs and rates of plants, animals, or other organisms.

AB  - This book provides an overview of the typical nature-based solutions (NBS) used for flood mitigation at different scales and in different areas (e.g. from catchment to hillslope scale; from urban to coastal areas). NBS can provide several ecosystem services, such as water regulation and water quality enhancement, and as such offer relevant technical solutions to complement typical grey infrastructures to mitigate flood hazard and water quality problems. In recent years, political awareness and interest from the scientific community have led to increasing implementation of NBS worldwide. In light of this trend, this book provides valuable insights into the environmental aspects of NBS, particularly their effectiveness for flood and pollution mitigation, and discusses socio-economic aspects related to the implementation of NBS, including regulatory aspects, cost, and citizens’ perceptions of NBS. Compiling the latest research, the book furthers our understanding of the role of NBS for flood mitigation and its relation to environmental aspects, to guide scientists and stakeholders in future NBS projects. It is intended for the scientific community and stakeholders, such as spatial planners and landscape managers.

In the 21st century, society is faced by rapid urbanisation and population growth, degradation and loss of natural capital and associated ecosystem services, an increase in natural disaster risks, and climate change. With growing recognition of the need to work with ecosystems to resolve these issues there is now a move towards nature-based solutions, which involve utilising nature’s ecosystem to solve societal challenges while providing multiple co-benefits. This book systematically reviews nature-based solutions from a public policy angle, assessing policy developments which encourage the implementation of nature-based solutions to address societal challenges while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. This includes enhancing sustainable urbanisation, restoring degraded ecosystems, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and reducing risks from natural disasters. While nature-based solutions can be applied strategically and equitably to help societies address a variety of climatic and non-climatic challenges, there is still a lack of understanding on how best to implement them. The book concludes by providing a best practice guide for those aiming to turn societal challenges into opportunities. This book will be of great interest to policymakers, practitioners and researchers involved in nature-based solutions, sustainable urban planning, environmental management, and sustainable development generally.

AB  - This article reviews the state of coral reefs in French Pacific territories in the context of global change (especially threats linked to climate change). We first outline the specific local characteristics, vulnerabilities, and threats faced by the coral reefs of New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna. We also emphasize local and other human communities’ economic and cultural reliance on coral reefs. Secondly, we discuss the natural and anthropogenic threats facing coral reefs in French Pacific territories, and current ecological responses such as mitigation and adaptation strategies. We conclude by proposing socio-economic solutions for the Pacific region across varying scales, with a special focus on enforcement measures and socio-political issues.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of coastal morphodynamics based on both methods of remote sensing and numerical modelling. The study indicates how coastal processes models can be used to explore plausible scenarios on how the coastline responses based on natural conditions and the construction of possible engineering solutions to the erosion problem. To address that, the model was calibrated and validated with field measurements data. Then, two possible engineering solutions were tested such as a breakwater and a nature-based solution such as artificial coral reef. The site selected was San Pedro beach, located in Santa Elena Province, Ecuador. The results show an erosion tendency with an average of 68 cm per year using remote sensing and 58 cm per year using numerical modelling. Even though breakwaters give and adequate coastal protection for the erosion issue, better results were found using artificial coral reef over time.

AB  - This article offers an introduction to a research project, "Urban Seascaping" (USS), which re-envisions the boundary between city and sea in response to the phenomenon of sea-level rise and frequent storm surge in the age of the Anthropocene. USS seeks to reconceptualise the current business-as-usual waterfront developments and coastal protection by investigating an unexplored solution space of embracing the agency of the sea and its coastal ecosystems as a key driver in the transformation of urban shorelines. With a focus on the coastal regions of Denmark, the research seeks to induce critical trans-disciplinary discussions on the limitations of a "hard approach" to coastal protection dominated by defence-driven mechanical handling of water. Moreover, the research highlights the current lack of marine nature-based "soft approach" in the waterfront area as part of coastal protection strategies. The project proposes a new form of urban commons in the waterfront, particularly exploring the full spectrum of coastal ecosystems using seaweed as a representative of a marine nature-based solution to enhance coastal resilience. The key is to depart from the current dualistic relationship between nature and culture to a more hybrid, interconnected and dynamic zone by incorporating coastal ecosystems as an active part of the socio-cultural cityscape and future resilience.

AB  - This article contributes to a special issue examining SDG 14 and other international policy instruments for effective implementation of the Goal. This article focuses on island ocean states (IOS), or ‘small island developing states’ (SIDS), which are characterized by limited land and oceanic remoteness, creating local and international dependencies for food, livelihoods, trade and transport. While IOS contribute less than 1% to global green-house gases, they are directly impacted by extreme weather and climate change, in particular sea level rise. Near-shore marine ecosystems (mangroves, seagrasses and coral reefs) provide critical coastal protection and other benefits (e.g. fisheries), yet continue to be degraded from coastal development. Given their importance, restoration is needed where ecosystem function has declined, in concert with conservation of healthy sites. The overall restoration goals for IOS are to: i) enhance ecological integrity, ii) inspire local capacity building, and iii) accelerate climate change adaptation. This article examines the scope for such restoration through the UN SDGs, the Biodiversity Convention, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Paris Agreement. Practical considerations of near-shore restoration are reviewed, emphasizing local and traditional knowledge regarding past and future perspectives. The article concludes with policy recommendations to integrate near-shore marine restoration across climate adaptation, conservation and planning processes to achieve synergies in effectiveness, essential to IOS settings. The UN SDGs provide a timely platform for IOS to align international processes with local needs to address their own goals in balancing population growth, economic development, food security and climate security.

AB  - There is widespread understanding that climate change has dramatic impacts especially for small islands. In the Maldives, a key challenge is to confront erosion processes along its coasts – past approaches have shown to not always be sustainable. Alternative approaches to coastal protection are therefore urgently needed. In this paper we use the concept of transformative governance to identify factors in society and politics that act as barriers and enablers to the introduction of alternative approaches to coastal protection in the Maldives. We investigate how inhabitants perceive coastal erosion risks and analyse people’s receptiveness to alternative coastal protection measures and their willingness to get involved in coastal protection. Governance structures are assessed against the context of conflicting central political, national and island peripherical interests. We identify hierarchical political structures in coastal protection governance as a dominant obstacle to alternative approaches. Based on empirical data collected in the research project DICES (Dealing with change in SIDS – societal action and political reaction in sea level change adaptation), we stress the importance of cultural aspects and sense of place when dealing with coastal protection. Further, we challenge the widespread assumption that people of the Maldives prefer hard coastal protection structures for their islands – a notion which is utilised by national politicians in their decision-making process to support the continuing application of hard protection measures. We discuss challenges to transformative governance related to shared responsibility, political power and openness to innovation.

AB  - There is substantial, growing literature that details positive human health effects, psychological and physiological, of exposure to “nature,” including “green” and “blue space,” with evidence suggesting that diversity of species or environments may have specific positive human health benefits. These health benefits are important ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. In this paper, we discuss several critical ecosystem services provided by wetlands including disaster risk reduction, with an emphasis on benefits to human health and well-being. Impacts to human health via damage to ecosystem services from disasters have rarely been considered in disaster planning or mitigation, nor have the health benefits been part of the framework for planning urban greenspaces and land-use. Coastal wetlands can be part of “natural and nature-based” solutions, minimizing the impacts of disasters by buffering coastal communities from storms and erosion and absorbing flood waters. In addition, mental and physical health benefits of experiencing healthy wetlands could offset some stress and disease encounters related to disasters. Thus, coastal wetlands should be part of a strategy for reducing the risk posed by disasters and facilitating recovery. We conclude with recommendations for research priorities and specific inclusion of wetlands in coastal community planning for disaster response and recovery.

AB  - There is substantial evidence that natural infrastructure (i.e., healthy ecosystems) and combinations of natural and built infrastructure (“hybrid” approaches) enhance coastal resilience by providing important storm and coastal flooding protection, while also providing other benefits. There is growing interest in the U.S., as well as around the world, to use natural infrastructure to help coastal communities become more resilient to extreme events and reduce the risk of coastal flooding. Here we highlight strengths and weaknesses of the coastal protection benefits provided by built infrastructure, natural ecosystems, and the innovative opportunities to combine the two into hybrid approaches for coastal protection. We also examine some case studies where hybrid approaches are being implemented to improve coastal resilience as well as some of the policy challenges that can make implementation of these approaches more difficult. The case studies we examine are largely in the U.S. but also include a couple of international examples as well. Based on this analysis, we conclude that coastal communities and other decision makers need better information in order to incorporate ecosystem protection and restoration into coastal resilience planning efforts. As additional projects are developed, it is important to capitalize on every opportunity to learn more about the cost of natural and hybrid infrastructure projects, the value of the storm and erosion protection benefits provided, and the full suite of co-benefits provided by healthy coastal ecosystems. We highlight top priorities for research, investment in, and application of natural and hybrid approaches. These data are critical to facilitate adoption of these approaches in planning and decision-making at all levels to enhance the resilience of our coasts.

AB  - There is growing interest in using ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to maintain or restore ecosystem services to increase human resilience to climate change. However, to date, the focus on EbA has been on conceptualising the approach and encouraging its use, rather than understanding EbA in practice. We review the EbA literature to synthesise where, why and how marine and coastal EbA projects have been implemented and examine how EbA has been integrated with marine spatial planning. We focus specifically on EbA projects in Asia and Oceania, where climate variability and dependence on marine and coastal ecosystems is high. Most projects were found in the grey literature, implemented in developing countries, and targeted extreme events and sea level rise. Mangroves, particularly mangrove restoration, was the most common ecosystem used, followed by coral reefs. EbA across ecosystems commonly targeted capacity building and livelihood enhancement, and maintenance of wildlife, alongside shoreline protection for mangroves and food security for coral reefs. Integrated EbA and marine spatial planning projects were participatory, implemented at local–regional scales, displayed adaptive management, and community-based or shared governance. Our research helps to build an understanding of EbA in practice and a knowledge base to assist coastal communities in adapting to climate change.

AB  - There is growing interest in the application of nature-based solutions to adapt to climate change and promote resilience, yet barriers exist to their implementation. These include a perceived lack of evidence of their functioning in comparison to conventional solutions and an inability for existing design, policy, and assessment processes to capture the multiple benefits of these solutions. Positing this as a challenge of operationalizing and measuring resilience, we argue that the concept of resilience needs to be given concrete meaning in applied management contexts. Starting with shoreline vulnerability as a policy problem and natural and nature-based shoreline features as a promising solution, we present a case study of a co-creative process to produce an interdisciplinary and locally relevant approach to understanding and capturing the benefits of natural and nature-based solutions. We develop the notion of resilience service to enable a concreteness to resilience that simultaneously takes into account ecological, technical, and social dimensions. Through the co-creative process, our researcher-practitioner network developed a monitoring framework for shoreline features in New York State to facilitate the comparison of natural and nature-based features with conventional shoreline approaches. We describe the process and assess the advantages and drawbacks of integrating scientific input and local knowledge. We present the monitoring framework, showing how the co-creative character of the process is consequential in the formulation of the final framework through the selection of parameters, indicators, and protocols. We argue that interdisciplinarity, co-creation, pragmatism, multi-scalar applicability, and policy relevance are critical principles to understand the functioning and facilitate the implementation of nature-based solutions, while recognizing that this work necessitates compromise and as such will lead to continued deliberation. We posit this is a strength of the process for it acknowledges the creation of resilience as a social process in which values are central and subject to change.

AB  - There is growing demand for novel coastal protection approaches that also provide co-benefits such as enhanced biodiversity. Rock-fillets, which are used to stabilise eroding banks in estuaries, can be colonised by mangroves, and may provide habitat for estuarine fauna. However, it is unknown whether hybrid mangrove/rock-fillet habitats are functionally equivalent to natural mangroves, for estuarine fauna. To determine whether hybrid mangrove habitats are functionally equivalent to natural mangroves, we used δ13C and δ15N stable isotope analyses to describe the isotopic niche space and overlap of estuarine species in these two habitats across three estuaries in NSW, Australia. Using a Bayesian standard ellipse analysis of isotopic niche area, over half the 12 species observed had larger isotopic niche areas in natural mangroves compared to hybrid habitats, however there were no clear patterns for species between habitats. Natural mangroves and hybrid rock-fillet habitats were isotopically distinct for all species sampled (low proportional overlap, 0–19%) suggesting they are not, at present, wholistically functionally equivalent. Estuarine communities from the two habitat types, however, had similar isotopic niches. Hybrid communities displayed a broader range of δ13C values compared to natural mangroves, suggesting mangrove/rock-fillet habitats have a more diverse range of basal food sources. These findings demonstrate the potential for defence solutions to provide unique co-benefits by supporting food webs, but also that natural habitats provide unique ecosystem services that should be protected and rehabilitated where possible. Future modelling and monitoring of habitat utilisation and species performance could provide further insight into the co-benefits and trade-offs of hybrid habitats.

AB  - There is growing awareness that “Nature-based Solutions” (NbS) can help to protect us from climate change impacts whilst slowing further warming, supporting biodiversity and securing ecosystem services. However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multifunctional landscapes are key. Here we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy—focussing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation—and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policymakers. They must ensure that NbS can achieve their potential to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crisis while also contributing to sustainable development. This will require systemic change in the way we conduct research and run our institutions.

AB  - There is great interest in the restoration and conservation of coastal habitats for protection from flooding and erosion. This is evidenced by the growing number of analyses and reviews of the effectiveness of habitats as natural defences and increasing funding world-wide for nature-based defences–i.e. restoration projects aimed at coastal protection; yet, there is no synthetic information on what kinds of projects are effective and cost effective for this purpose. This paper addresses two issues critical for designing restoration projects for coastal protection: (i) a synthesis of the costs and benefits of projects designed for coastal protection (nature-based defences) and (ii) analyses of the effectiveness of coastal habitats (natural defences) in reducing wave heights and the biophysical parameters that influence this effectiveness. We (i) analyse data from sixty-nine field measurements in coastal habitats globally and examine measures of effectiveness of mangroves, salt-marshes, coral reefs and seagrass/kelp beds for wave height reduction; (ii) synthesise the costs and coastal protection benefits of fifty-two nature-based defence projects and; (iii) estimate the benefits of each restoration project by combining information on restoration costs with data from nearby field measurements. The analyses of field measurements show that coastal habitats have significant potential for reducing wave heights that varies by habitat and site. In general, coral reefs and salt-marshes have the highest overall potential. Habitat effectiveness is influenced by: a) the ratios of wave height-to-water depth and habitat width-to-wavelength in coral reefs; and b) the ratio of vegetation height-to-water depth in salt-marshes. The comparison of costs of nature-based defence projects and engineering structures show that salt-marshes and mangroves can be two to five times cheaper than a submerged breakwater for wave heights up to half a metre and, within their limits, become more cost effective at greater depths. Nature-based defence projects also report benefits ranging from reductions in storm damage to reductions in coastal structure costs.

AB  - There is extensive experience in adaptive management of exposed sandy coastlines through sand nourishment for coastal protection. However, in complex estuarine systems, coastlines are often shortened through damming estuaries to achieve desired safety levels. The Dutch Deltaworks illustrate that this approach disrupts natural sediment fluxes and harms ecosystem health, which negatively affects derived ecosystem services, such as freshwater availability and mussel and oyster farming. This heavily impacts local communities and thus requires additional maintenance and management efforts. Nevertheless, the discussion on coastline shortening keeps surfacing when dealing with complex coastal management issues throughout the world. Although adaptive delta management accompanied by innovative approaches that integrate coastal safety with ecosystem services is gaining popularity, it is not yet common practice to include adaptive pathways, a system-based view and ecosystem knowledge into coastal management projects. Here, we provide a first attempt to integrate ecosystem-based flood risk reduction measures in the standard suite of flood risk management solutions, ranging from structural to non-structural. Additionally, for dealing with the dynamic and more unpredictable nature of ecosystems, we suggest the adaptive delta management approach that consists of flexible measures, measurable targets, monitoring and intervention, as a framework for embedding ecosystem-based alternatives for flood risk mitigation in the daily practice of engineers and coastal planners.

AB  - There is an increasing awareness worldwide about the need to develop more sustainable, multi-functional and resilient solutions to the complex challenges posed by climate change. At the same time, the need of transitioning to a more circular economy is rising. In this context, different nature-based solutions have been developed in different fields and countries. Such solutions are based on the idea of working together with nature instead of against nature. However, the definition of nature-based solutions varies per country and within different organizations. Furthermore, these solutions have been tested so far mostly in coastal areas or in urban environments. There is therefore a gap of information about the possibilities in freshwater systems, namely in river areas where such interventions were limited to restoration projects. Furthermore, the relation between nature-based solutions and circular economy has not been much explored. In the present paper the concept of Building with Nature (BwN) in river areas is defined and examples are given. These examples were analyzed with the circular economy principles. The results showed that the circular economy principles help to evaluate the sustainability of BwN solutions and BwN solutions could improve quality, resilience and cost efficiency. Therefore, it is recommended to start with the development of BwN demonstration projects in river areas, as a means to develop pathways to sustainable river systems.

AB  - There is a growing need for coastal and marine restoration, but it is not clear how to pay for it given that environmental funding is low, and national budgets are stretched in response to natural hazards. We use risk-industry methods and find that coral reef and mangrove restoration could yield strong Return on Investment (ROI) for flood risk reduction on shorelines across more than 20 Caribbean countries. These results are robust to changes in discount rates and the timing of restoration benefits. Data on restoration costs are sparse, but the Present Value (PV) of restored natural infrastructure shows that ROI would be positive in many locations even if restoration costs are in the hundreds of thousand per hectare for mangroves and millions per km for reefs. Based on these benefits, we identify significant sources of funding for restoring these natural defenses.

AB  - There is a growing interest in including blue carbon ecosystems (i.e., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) in climate mitigation programs in national and sub-national policies, with restoration and conservation of these ecosystems identified as potential activities to increase carbon accumulation through time. However, there is still a gap on the spatial scales needed to produce carbon offsets comparable with terrestrial or agricultural ecosystems. Here, we used the Coastal Blue Carbon InVEST 3.7.0 model to estimate future net carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems along Australia's Great Barrier Reef (hereafter GBR) catchments, considering different management scenarios (i.e., reintroduction of tidal exchange through the removal of barriers, sea level rise, restoring low lying land) at three different spatial scales: whole GBR coastline, regional (14,000–16,300 ha), and local (335–370 ha) scales. The focus of the restoration (i.e., tidal marshes and/or mangroves) was dependent on data availability for each scenario. Furthermore, we also estimated the monetary value of carbon sequestration under each management scenario and spatial scale assessed in the study. We found that large scale restoration of tidal marshes could potentially sequester an additional ∼800,000 tonnes of CO2e by 2045 (potentially generating AU$12 million based on the average Australia carbon price), with greater opportunities when sea level rise is accounted for in the modelling. Also, we found that regional and local projects would generate up to 23 tonnes CO2e ha−1 by the end of the crediting period. Our results can guide future decisions in the blue carbon market and financing schemes, however, the return on investment is dependent on the carbon price and funding scheme available for project implementation.

AB  - There are several nature-based adaptation options available to coastal nations. In this paper, we offer a brief overview of these options and then focus on mangroves to consider how laws and policies can support nature-based solutions and thereby contribute to more effective overall adaptation efforts. We first outline the concept of adaptation and its variants, thereby setting the context for this study. We then briefly explore the science relating to nature-based adaptation. We analyze the international legal regime in place to protect mangrove ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the merits, the challenges, and strategies developed to surmount some of the challenges that coastal countries can face while implementing nature-based adaptation options by utilizing Bangladesh’s experience on mangrove conservation as a case study. Ultimately, we conclude that it may be necessary to implement both hard and nature-based adaptation options and that an effective law and policy framework will be critical. It will also be important to look beyond physical coastal protection to augment coastal livelihoods and build resilient coastal communities with greater adaptive capacities

AB  - The world’s coastal zones are experiencing rapid development and an increase in storms and flooding. These hazards put coastal communities at heightened risk, which may increase with habitat loss. Here we analyse globally the role and cost effectiveness of coral reefs in risk reduction. Meta-analyses reveal that coral reefs provide substantial protection against natural hazards by reducing wave energy by an average of 97%. Reef crests alone dissipate most of this energy (86%). There are 100 million or more people who may receive risk reduction benefits from reefs or bear hazard mitigation and adaptation costs if reefs are degraded. We show that coral reefs can provide comparable wave attenuation benefits to artificial defences such as breakwaters, and reef defences can be enhanced cost effectively. Reefs face growing threats yet there is opportunity to guide adaptation and hazard mitigation investments towards reef restoration to strengthen this first line of coastal defence.

AB  - The world’s coastal communities are becoming more vulnerable to ocean hazards due to rising sea levels and increasing coastal populations. Coastal areas and communities can be protected from the impacts of coastal hazards by engineered structures or natural systems. Engineered structures such as seawalls, revetments and breakwaters are rigid, expensive and reduce coastal amenity values. In contrast, many ecosystems provide coastal protection services and are adaptive. Natural systems in the coastal zone such as mangroves, seagrass, kelp, saltmarshes and reefs can dissipate more wave energy than a sandy foreshore of the same cross-shore shape. However, many of these protective ecosystems are in decline due to global change and local stressors, and their importance for coastal protection strategies is poorly understood by decision-makers. This chapter reviews the capacity of natural environments to protect the shoreline during extreme events. It highlights the benefits of nature-based systems but also the shortcomings in comparison to traditional engineered structures.

AB  - The world is struggling to limit greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the human footprint on nature. We therefore urgently need to think about how to achieve more with actions to address mounting challenges for human health and wellbeing from biodiversity loss, climate change effects, and unsustainable economic and social development. Nature-based Solutions (NBS) have emerged as a systemic approach and an important component of the response to these challenges. In marine and coastal spaces, NBS can contribute to improved environmental health, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and a more sustainable blue economy, if implemented to a high standard. However, NBS have been largely studied for terrestrial – particularly urban – systems, with limited uptake thus far in marine and coastal areas, despite an abundance of opportunities. Here, we provide explanations for this lag and propose the following three research priorities to advance marine and coastal NBS: (1) Improve understanding of marine and coastal biodiversity-ecosystem services relationships to support NBS better designed for rebuilding system resilience and achieving desired ecological outcomes under climate change; (2) Provide scientific guidance on how and where to implement marine and coastal NBS and better coordinate strategies and projects to facilitate their design, effectiveness, and value through innovative synergistic actions; (3) Develop ways to enhance marine and coastal NBS communication, collaboration, ocean literacy and stewardship to raise awareness, co-create solutions with stakeholders, boost public and policy buy-in, and potentially drive a more sustained investment. Research effort in these three areas will help practitioners, policy-makers and society embrace NBS for managing marine and coastal ecosystems for tangible benefits to people and marine life.

AB  - The West African coast is vulnerable to natural hazards and human interventions. Although various measures have been taken at different scales, mostly at the local level, there is a need to improve management at the regional level. We examine these actions and possible solutions from different perspectives and provide conclusions and recommendations on the integration of solutions to improve coastal management. From North West Mauritania to across the Gulf of Guinea a system of coastal zoning that can be managed holistically is encouraged. The development of holistic planning is seen as a sustainable approach to management that seeks to link users/processes together rather than focus on a single particular issue and solution. Strengthening, monitoring, promoting the observation network and generalising open data centralisation and exchange for a better understanding of coastal dynamics and pressures is encouraged. There is a need for capacity building, expertise and federative actions. Furthermore, the need to identify and involve not only stakeholders, but also communities and scientists with multilevel inputs. All must agree on coordinated plans to achieve stakeholder objectives, using an approach adapted to the multi-spatial scale (e.g at the scale of sediment cells, integrating from the sources of sediment in river basins to their redistribution along the coast, perturbed by climate changes and anthropic stresses), so that only regional solutions are appropriate and will be effective. These must follow sustainable strategies with a multi-temporal sequenced solution and anticipate changes, or adaptive solutions using solutions in synergy with different time frames as well as managing natural and human systems responsibly. A plan that considers changes in coastal systems and anticipates impacts and adapts plans accordingly will be key.

AB  - The wave attenuation service (WAS) literature review over the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel encompasses saltmarshes, mudflats, seagrasses, shelly cheniers, oyster, honeycomb worm and sandworm reefs, which all together will be named “ecogeosystems” in this review due to their combination of biogenic systems, ecological systems and geomorphological systems (Mury et al. in Geophys Res Abstr 20:2044, 2018). It provides a comparative meta-analysis of the various measurements of wave attenuation induced by “ecogeosystems” across different studies focusing on wave height monitoring. The array of “ecogeosystems” included in this review was firstly identified through a fine-scale mapping of the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel, then literature research was led using several keywords related to ecosystem services and coastal protection. A total of 32 studies was compiled over six countries. The majority of studies was located on North-Atlantic Ocean coastlines. According to their specificities, “ecogeosystems” were synthetically split into two categories, surface (saltmarshes, mudflats, seagrasses and oyster reefs) and punctual (shelly cheniers), for the sake of the WAS comparability. WAS associated with surface saltmarshes, mudflats, seagrasses, and oyster reefs ranged from 0.25 to 7.86%/m, from 0.01 to 4%/m, from 0.03 to 0.77%/m, from 1 to 64%/m, respectively. The punctual shelly chenier was monitored from 70 to 98%. Honeycomb worm and sandworm reefs have no data about WAS according to our literature review.

AB  - The vulnerability of coastal communities and the growing risks to coastal infrastructure continue largely due to past and ongoing patterns of development in high risk areas. This project is focused on increasing the use of natural and nature-based features (NNBFs) to increase resilience of coastal communities to flooding caused by extreme weather events. This project has proposed two efforts to increase understanding of NNBFS; 1) describe the current status, and 2) quantify role of NNBF creation/ restoration for water quality benefits in support of coastal resilience. The products of the 3-year project are intended to support informed coastal management decision-making regarding two concerns associated with NNBFs: The natural capital of coastal communities is generally declining, and is projected to decline at an accelerating rate due to sea level rise and current land use practices. The use of NNBFs to sustain or increase resilience in coastal communities is restricted by the many competing needs for limited local resources.

AB  - The vulnerabilities of coastal communities have increased in recent years, as more people have to live in hazard-prone areas due to population growth. The east coast of India is one such vulnerable area that faces the combined challenge of climate risks and poverty. This study identifies the environmental and socioeconomic factors contributing to the resilience building that helped the communities in the study area to cope with cyclone Phailin in 2013 and cyclone Hudhud in 2014. We used questionnaire surveys, GIS and satellite data, and econometric analysis to identify these features. The damage suffered by the households, and the time needed by them to return to the pre-cyclone situation were used as indicators of resilience. We found that factors such as high education, decision-making power of women, and presence of coastline vegetation of local species such as cashew and palmyra helped the communities to build resilience toward cyclones.

AB  - The use of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) [1] are currently seen as a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to conventional coastal engineering protection. Additional ecosystems such as dunes, mangroves, seagrass meadows, tidal marshes, coral reefs and shellfish reefs generates a natural resilience to the impact of storms and are able to keep up with sea-level rise through long-term sediment trapping and organic matter accretion [2]. There is thus a growing trend to include regional NbS in estuarine and coastal project development as a way to protect certain areas against natural forces [3]. The implementation of the NbS-concept in the marine environment necessitates in-depth knowledge of the driving parameters and local natural processes. This expertise is needed to integrate the stochastic nature of ecosystem development with the traditional technical engineering of coastal management tools (i.e. design, installation, operational management and maintenance). The result is a ground-breaking new coastal management approach: a Nature-based engineering project which identifies coastal habitats and determines their viability, function and possible contribution to coastal protection [4].

AB  - The use of nature-based infrastructure (NBI) has attracted increasing attention in the context of protection against coastal flooding. This review is focused on NBI approaches to improve coastal resilience in the face of extreme storm events, including hurricanes. We not only consider the role of NBI as a measure to protect people and property but also in the context of other ecological goods and services provided by tidal wetlands including production of fish and shellfish. Although the results of many studies suggest that populated areas protected by coastal marshes were less likely to experience damage when exposed to the full force of storm surge, it was absolutely critical to place the role of coastal wetlands into perspective by noting that while tidal marshes can reduce wave energy from low-to-moderate-energy storms, their capacity to substantially reduce storm surge remains poorly quantified. Moreover, although tidal marshes can reduce storm surge from fast moving storms, very large expanses of habitat are needed to be most effective, and for most urban settings, there is insufficient space to rely on nature-based risk reduction strategies alone. The success of a given NBI method is also context dependent on local conditions, with potentially confounding influences from substrate characteristics, topography, near shore bathymetry, distance from the shore and other physical factors and human drivers such as development patterns. Furthermore, it is important to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of newly developed NBI projects through rigorous evaluations and characterize the local specificities of the particular built and natural environments surrounding these coastal areas. In order for the relevant science to better inform policy, and assist in land-use challenges, scientists must clearly state the likelihood of success in a particular circumstance and set of conditions. We conclude that “caution is advised” before selecting a particular NBI method as there is no “one size fits all” solution to address site-specific conditions.

AB  - The transport sector fulfils crucial economic and social functions with railways being instrumental in the safe, efficient, and reliable movements of people to their destinations and goods to market. One of the most critical vulnerabilities in the railway transport system is the low flexibility of both infrastructure and operations in the event of disturbances including those caused by extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, storm surges and temperature extremes. With the frequency and intensity of such events being projected to increase, the failure to proactively consider the impacts of a changing climate on new and existing infrastructure raises the possibility of increased service disruption and adverse economic impacts as climate change progresses. Nature-based solutions (NbS) present long-lasting, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable climate change adaptation (CCA) options. However, as an effective alternative or complement to grey (engineered) solutions, they are still in their infancy, especially within the railway sector. To date very few studies have investigated the role of NbS for CCA in the railway transport system. Recognizing the importance of the rail industry's need to adapt its infrastructure to accommodate current weather extremes and a changing climate, this review paper examines NbS being used as CCA measures both in the rail context, and in non-rail contexts which may be transferable to the rail sector. Our review demonstrates that there are significant knowledge gaps that may hinder the uptake of NbS in the rail environment which warrant further research to support the inclusion of NbS as viable CCA options for rail infrastructure. Better understanding of these issues is required for the development of rail sector specific guidance and will enable better design, implementation, and dissemination of NbS as credible alternatives or complements, and more sustainable CCA measures.

AB  - The transition from the current linear model of abstraction, use and discharge of water into recycle-reuse under the circular economy (CE) principles is momentous. An analysis of recent literature about the economic impact of linear to circular (L2C) transition is made. The review investigates the economic implications (i.e. cost-benefit) of deployment of enabling technologies, tools and methodologies within the circular water systems. The study is enhanced by presenting the results of our investigation into the policy impact (push-barriers) of L2C transition. As the vehicle for the L2C transition, nature-based solutions (NBS) and its economic and policy implications is discussed. A framework is proposed for the monetary assessment of the costs of investment in NBS technologies, infrastructure and education against the environmental and socio-economic benefits within the policy frameworks. This framework may build the early foundation for bridging the gap that exists for a systematic and objective economic impact (cost-benefit) analysis of L2C transition in the Water sector. This framework will lead to a generic multi-parametric cost model of NBS for Circularity Water Systems.

AB  - The Texas Coastal Exchange (TCX) is a concept developed by the Severe Storm Prediction, Education, and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center at Rice University under a grant from the Houston Endowment. The TCX was conceived as a nonstructural hurricane surge damage reduction concept in which landowners who restore natural areas to provide certain ecological protection services receive compensation through a voluntary market exchange. Over time, this concept has emerged as a mechanism to address several of the most important issues of the early twenty-first century, including flood damage mitigation, water quantity and quality enhancement, climate change, and fish and wildlife conservation, as well as a means to provide economic resilience in both the farm and ranch community and the oil and gas industry. In short, restoring natural systems through the creation of a voluntary private sector market may enable major progress in addressing several key present-day issues and spearhead major strides toward a circular macroeconomic system that will be required for the future.

AB  - The terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms all provide essential ecosystem services in urban environments. However, the services provided by each realm are often considered independently, which ignores the synergies between them and risks underestimating the benefits derived collectively. Greater research collaboration across these realms, and an integrated approach to management decisions can help to support urban developments and restoration projects in maintaining or enhancing ecosystem services. The aim of this paper is to highlight the synergies and trade-offs among ecosystem services provided by each realm and to offer suggestions on how to improve current practice. We use case studies to illustrate the flow of services across realms. In our call to better integrate research and management across realms, we present a framework that provides a 6-step process for conducting collaborative research and management with an Australian perspective. Our framework considers unifying language, sharing, and understanding of desired outcomes, conducting cost-benefit analyses to minimise trade-offs, using multiple modes of communication for stakeholders, and applying research outcomes to inform regulation. It can be applied to improve collaboration among researchers, managers and planners from all realms, leading to strategic allocation of resources, increased protection of urban natural resources and improved environmental regulation with broad public support.

AB  - The sustainable management of post-industrial coasts is a major emerging issue globally. Along such coasts, there may be a significant legacy of both contaminated land (including historic landfills and non-managed waste disposal) and contaminated sediments in and around urban and industrial areas, which require new strategies for cost-effective and integrated risk management under future sea-level rise and climate change scenarios. Here, we review current approaches to managing contamination in post-industrial coastlines, discuss emerging integrated management strategies (building on low input approaches to sustainable brownfields regeneration) and present an approach and framework for assessing and comparing different scenarios for coastal brownfield regeneration to soft re-use and other end-points. This framework can be applied to explore the opportunities for synergy and realisation of wider environmental, economic and societal benefits between coastal protection, dredged material re-use and the management of brownfield land. As such, the approach we propose supports planning and options appraisal to realise maximum benefit and value from integrated coastal management strategies.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and associated targets focus on a wide range of global issues and can be useful in coastal challenges such as climate change and green economic growth. The aim of this study is to tailor the SDGs, as a universally recognized policy framework, to assess the sustainability performance for coastal flood protection management to enhance climate-resilient and adaptable coastal development. To operationalize this aim, the SDG Sustainability Impact Score (SDG-SIS) framework was developed. Based on system functionalities for the land–sea interface, 38 SDGs were identified in the SDG-SIS framework. Given the availability of public numeric data, only 12 SDG targets are connected with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The SDG-SIS framework was applied to two different sets of cases, including five coastline and five sand nourishment cases. This study shows that the geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the two sets of cases should be considered in the selection of system functionalities as well as the consideration of SDG targets. Moreover, cross-linking cumulative consequences of SIS do not directly indicate the level of sustainability, but the individual SDG target data are essential to reveal the underlying details. This stresses the importance of prioritizing SDGs to serve as leverage for policymakers to optimize the climate resilience and adaptation of coastal management. The SDG-SIS framework enables the support of coastal policy by addressing long-term measures and providing a sustainable vision for future implementation.

AB  - The success of any restoration depends on the choice of an environment that is suitable, not just for the adult species and reef structures but also for the transport and settlement conditions for larvae. Hydrodynamics is one of the fundamental primary driving forces for habitat suitability, defining the possibilities for transport and settlement of larvae, probabilities of dislodgement and the mobility of sediment. Furthermore, hydrodynamics is also a fundamental factor in the transport of heat, nutrients and phytoplankton through the water column, thereby influencing food availability, temperature regimes and other factors that determine habitat suitability and carrying capacity for shellfish and other species. Deltares has developed a numerical model of the North Sea hydrodynamics. Within the ECOFRIEND project this model has been applied and validated with measurements collected at a restoration site in the GEMINI off shore wind farm. The model appears to perform very well in terms of predicting temperature regime and stratification, allowing to calculate parameters such as the “degree day” to predict timing of spawning and larval swarming. Furthermore, hydrodynamic forces can also dislodge and transport material, including cages and other deployment structures for oyster restoration. At the Gemini pilot site some oyster cages were lost in 2018. The model, in combination with a basic stability and migration model for cages indicated that over the period the cages were deployed, storm conditions occurred that were strong enough to dislodge and subsequently transport the cages. Application of improved and validated models will prevent losses, but also prevent excessive costs due to over-specification and also make it easier to have wind farm operators accept such structures in the vicinity of turbines. Such ecosystem models can give insights in many aspects relevant to restoration projects. The development of such models requires serious investment and interpreting the results is specialist work. However, such models have many other application fields for marine spatial planning, and if restoration project can make use of such developments for site selection and deployment methodology, risks of failure can be diminished.

AB  - The subtropical ROPME Sea Area (RSA), comprising the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the northern Arabian Sea, is a heavily exploited sea region that experiences extreme environmental conditions, and for which climate change is expected to further impact marine ecosystems and coastal communities, sectors and industries. Climate change risk assessments provide a valuable tool to inform decision-making and adaptation planning through identifying and prioritising climate risks and/or opportunities. Using the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment as an example, a marine climate change risk assessment was undertaken for the marine and coastal environment of the RSA for the first time. Through an extensive literature review and a workshop involving regional experts, marine and coastal climate change risks were identified, scored and prioritised. A total of 45 risks were identified, which spanned two key themes: ‘Risks to Biodiversity’ and ‘Risks to Economy and Society’. Of these, 13 were categorised as ‘severe’, including degradation of coral reefs and their associated ecological assemblages, shifts in the distribution of wild-capture fisheries resources, changes to phytoplankton primary productivity, impacts on coastal communities, threats to infrastructure and industries, and impacts on operations and safety in maritime transport. The diversity of risks identified and their transboundary nature highlight that climate change adaptation responses will require coordinated action and cooperation at multiple scales across the RSA. This risk assessment provides a crucial baseline for a largely overlooked geographic area, that can be used to underpin future decision-making and adaptation planning on climate change, and serve as a ‘blueprint’ for similar assessments for other regional shared seas.

AB  - The sprawl of marine construction is one of the most extreme human modifications to global seascapes. Nevertheless, its global extent remains largely unquantified compared to that on land. We synthesized disparate information from a diversity of sources to provide a global assessment of the extent of existing and projected marine construction and its effects on the seascape. Here we estimated that the physical footprint of built structures was at least 32,000 km2 worldwide as of 2018, and is expected to cover 39,400 km2 by 2028. The area of seascape modified around structures was 1.0–3.4 × 106 km2 in 2018 and was projected to increase by 50–70% for power and aquaculture infrastructure, cables and tunnels by 2028. In 2018, marine construction affected 1.5% (0.7–2.4%) of global Exclusive Economic Zones, comparable to the global extent of urban land estimated at 0.02–1.7%. This study provides a critical baseline for tracking future marine human development.

AB  - The spatial extent of seagrass is poorly mapped, and knowledge of historical loss is limited. Here, we collated empirical and qualitative data using systematic review methods to provide unique analysis on seagrass occurrence and loss in the United Kingdom. We document 8,493 ha of recently mapped seagrass in the United Kingdom since 1998. This equates to an estimated 0.9 Mt of carbon, which, in the current carbon market represents about £22 million. Using simple models to estimate seagrass declines triangulated against habitat suitability models, we provide evidence of catastrophic seagrass loss; at least 44% of United Kingdom's seagrasses have been lost since 1936, 39% since the 1980's. However, losses over longer time spans may be as high as 92%. Based on these estimates, historical seagrass meadows could have stored 11.5 Mt of carbon and supported approximately 400 million fish. Our results demonstrate the vast scale of losses and highlight the opportunities to restore seagrass to support a range of ecosystems services.

AB  - The Shoreline Management Model (SMM) is a novel geospatial approach used to assess conditions along a shoreline, and recommend best management practices for defended and undefended shorelines. The SMM models available spatial data in order to identify areas where the use of living shorelines would be suitable to address shoreline erosion. The model was developed to support and inform decision-making by shoreline managers responsible for management of shoreline resources, shorefront property owners, and tidal habitat restoration actions. Recommended erosion control strategies are based on scientific knowledge of how shorelines respond to natural conditions and anthropogenic measures used to stabilize shorelines. The SMM uses input variables representing current conditions and recommends a strategy that falls into one of three general categories: living shorelines, traditional approaches, and special considerations. Areas of special consideration are areas where the model may not be able to provide an appropriate recommendation due to ecological, geological, or highly developed conditions. These areas are given recommendations that include the instruction to seek expert advice. Data required to run the model include presence of tidal marsh, beach, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), riparian land cover, bank height, nearshore bathymetry, fetch, and shoreline erosion control structures. The model has been calibrated and validated along Virginia's Chesapeake Bay shoreline, USA. The model results are largely consistent with field recommendations (i.e., shoreline management recommendations made by scientists based on on-site observations during shoreline evaluation visits). The SMM performed with an overall accuracy of 82.5%. The SMM is exportable; the model code can be adapted to other systems. This geospatial model provides a robust screening tool for local and state governments, coastal and environmental planners and engineers, as well as property owners, when considering best management practices, including living shorelines as an alternative for erosion control.

IPBES is an independent, intergovernmental body, established in 2012 to provide evidence-based, objective and policy-relevant information to decision makers regarding the planet’s biodiversity, ecosystems and the benefits they provide. The Platform’s work is divided into four functions: performing assessments of knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem services and their interlinkages; supporting policy formulation and implementation by identifying policyrelevant tools and methodologies; building the capacity and knowledge of member States; and ensuring impact through an effective communication and outreach strategy. The Platform’s governing body is the Plenary, made up of the representatives of IPBES member States. Representatives of non-member States, biodiversityrelated conventions, related UN bodies, non-governmental organisations and other relevant organisations and agencies can attend the Plenary as observers. The work of the Plenary is supported by its Bureau, overseeing the Platform’s administrative functions, and the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel (MEP) overseeing the Platform’s scientific and technical functions.

AB  - The role of coastal blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation and adaptation efforts has been recognized. Blue carbon ecosystem functionality is one component of coastal nature-based or green–gray infrastructure multifunctionality, which includes contributions by nature to disaster risk reduction, infrastructure resilience, erosion control, land formation, and other ecosystem services. Here we review how green infrastructure and nature-based solutions in coastal and shallow nearshore areas can contribute to blue climate change mitigation and adaptation. We then summarize available coastal infrastructure types (green, gray, and green–gray hybrid) in terms of their inherent functions and potential co-benefits. We discuss technologies for integrating gray and green infrastructure and producing hybrid infrastructure to promote implementation of measures for both climate change and infrastructure development, although the best infrastructure type is dependent on the risks of a given time and locality. Collaboration among engineers, scientists, and economists who are interested in climate change or infrastructure and in emerging fields such as blue carbon and green infrastructure are needed to further enhance the implementation of multifunctional infrastructure, but the multifunctionality benefits should be quantified and monetized.

AB  - The risks from climate change are ever-growing, especially in more vulnerable and exposed regions such as coastlines. The rise in sea level and increase in the frequency and intensity of climate-induced coastal hazards are threatening the increasing coastal populations. Brazil, with its 8,500 km of coast, is one of the countries most at risk from coastal flooding and erosion. Nature-based solutions have been suggested as climate adaptation strategies with the greatest potential to counteract coastal hazards stemming from sea-level rise and safeguard coastal cities. However, there is still a knowledge gap in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of nature-based solutions, especially at large spatial scales in Central and South America. Here, we assessed the risks from climate-induced hazards of coastal erosion and flooding related to sea-level rise on the Brazilian coast, and the effectiveness of nature-based solutions as climate adaptation strategies. We reveal that nature-based shoreline protection can reduce by 2.5 times the risks to the Brazilian coastline. The loss of existing natural habitats would substantially increase the area and population at risk from these climate-induced hazards. Worrisomely, legal mechanisms to protect these natural habitats are few and being weakened. Only 10% of the coastal natural habitats are within protected areas, and these alone do not ensure coastal protection, as our results indicate that the loss of unprotected natural habitats has about the same risk as the total absence of natural habitats. Our results warn of the severe consequences of the continued loss of natural habitats along the coast. Thus, actions towards the maintenance and protection of coastal habitats are paramount for climate adaptation and to ensure the well-being and livelihoods of coastal populations. Brazil has a central role in demonstrating the benefits of strategies based on nature-based solutions for shoreline protection, favoring their implementation worldwide. We provide both the natural habitat maps and the maps with model results with spatial and numerical information so readers can explore the relations between the natural habitats and coastal risk indexes at a sub-national level and foster their use by local stakeholders.

AB  - The risk of coastal storm flooding is deteriorating under global warming, especially for the heavily urbanized deltaic cities, like Shanghai. The Nature-Based Flood Defense (NBFD), as an eco-friendly design alternative for hard infrastructure against coastal flooding, is gaining attention. Nevertheless, the vulnerability of saltmarsh due to the biological instability, resulting in the uncertainties on coastal protection, is considered the bottleneck challenge that hinders the broad application of the NBFD concept. We argue that except for direct wave attenuations by the above-ground vegetation during storms, the gradual sediment trapping and consolidating during the non-storm period is a more crucial function of coastal saltmarsh, which mitigates storm waves by forming a broader and higher intertidal morphology. This benefit is an important value of saltmarsh-based coastal protection but is largely neglected in many NBFD studies. Taking Chongming Dongtan Shoal (CDS) as a case study, we demonstrated that over 2/3th wave attenuation during storms is contributed by the saltmarsh morphology, and less than 1/3th is from the saltmarsh vegetation. The relative contribution of the saltmarsh morphology on wave mitigation is even enhanced under the increasing storm grades from 100 yrs. to 5000 yrs. return levels. To promote this idea for broader application, the cost-benefit analysis of three artificial NBFD solutions (e.g., submerged breakwater, timber piles, and sand nourishment) are compared. We identified an optimal measure of the submerged breakwater for CDS, which minimizes the ecological impact and maximizes the cost-benefit. Moreover, the wave-free zone behind the breakwater increases the chance of vegetation establishment, helps suspended sediment trapping, hence fostering a beneficent cycle for saltmarsh restoration. In summary, ignoring the contribution of saltmarsh morphology on wave attenuation largely underestimated the benefits of vegetation-based coastal protection, which should be greatly emphasized to provide a solid basis for developing NBFD.

AB  - The retrocés that kicks the Delta de l'Ebre since last year, there are great threats to which are faced by the Climate Change, due to the increase in sea level and sea storms, each cop more frequent , is of great concern for its future, on the part of scientists and society in general. Donades però, the latest research on Nature based Solutions (NbS), solutions based on nature, seems that these can help mitigate the effects that this ecosystem is suffering. Arran de tot això, in the present work there has been a study of all the NbS that have been found as recommandable to face the coastal protection. The ones that are planted in these are: the oyster sculptures, the coral sculptures, the aiguamolls, the marine herbes, the dunes, the barrier islands and the mangroves. From all of these there is a common explanation, their distribution at a global level and the benefits that they provide among others. A cop dut a terme l'estudi previ sobre les NbS, s'ha plantejat la construció d'un escull d'ostres a través de una low crest reef (LCR). There has been a study of different areas of the Delta de l'Ebre that are currently considered to be the most affected by erosion and it has been decided to develop the design of the LCR for Platja de Buda. Finally, the results of the transmission coefficient of the onades have been extracted, which is donarien in the case that a submerged or emerged LCR is implemented and has been seen as affecting the erosion of the area and the coastline. It has been concluded that the best results obtained by the proposed LCR, in the case of Platja de Buda, are the ones that are done by an emerged structure of 0. The decline suffered by the Ebro Delta, for years now, as well as the great threats it faces due to Climate Change, the rise in sea level and the increasingly frequent marine storms, is of great concern. by scientists and society in general, for its future. Given the latest research on Nature based Solutions (NbS), solutions based on nature, it seems that these can help mitigate the effects that this ecosystem is suffering. As a result of all this, in the present work a study of all the NbS that have been believed to be the most recommendable to face coastal protection has been prepared. Those that arise are: oyster reefs, coral reefs, wetlands, sea grass, dunes, barrier islands and mangroves. Of all these, it has been explained how they are, their global distribution and the benefits they provide, among others. Once the previous study on the NbS was carried out, the construction of an oyster reef through a low crest reef (LCR) has been considered. A study has been made of different areas of the Ebro Delta that are considered to be among the most affected by erosion and it has been decided to prepare the design of the LCR for Buda Beach. Finally, the results of the wave transmission coefficient that would occur if the submerged or emerged LCR were implemented have been extracted, and it has been seen how this would affect the erosivity of the area and the coastline. It has been concluded that the best results obtained for the LCR proposed in the case of Buda Beach are those obtained for an emerged structure of 0. The setback that the Ebro delta is suffering for the last years, and the threats it faces given Climate Change, due to sea level rise and sea storms, which are becoming increasingly frequent, generates a great concern for the scientific community and for the society, about his future. Given the latest research in Nature based Solutions (NbS), it seems that all these can contribute to mitigate the effects that these ecosystems are suffering. As a result of all this, in the present work, a study has been proposed with all the NbS that are most recommendable to deal with coastal protection. The NbS considered are: oyster reefs, coral reefs, wetlands, seagrasses, dunes, barrier islands, and mangroves. An explanation of how they are, their global distributions and the benefits that they bring.

AB  - The restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, is increasingly used as a management tool to mitigate climate change by removing and sequestering atmospheric carbon in the ground. However, estimates of carbon-offset potential are currently based on data from natural mangrove forests, potentially leading to overestimating the carbon-offset potential from restored mangroves. Here, in the first study of its kind, we utilise 210Pb sediment age-dating techniques and greenhouse gas flux measures to estimate blue carbon additionality in restored mangrove forests, ranging from 13 to 35 years old. As expected, mangrove age had a significant effect on carbon additionality and carbon accretion rate, with the older mangrove stands (17 and 35 years old) holding double the total carbon stocks (aboveground + soil stocks; ∼115 tonnes C ha−1) and double the soil sequestration rates (∼3 tonnes C ha−1 yr−1) than the youngest mangrove stand (13 years old). Although soil carbon stocks increased with mangrove age, the aboveground plant stocks were highest in the 17-year-old stand. Mangrove age also had a significant effect on soil carbon fluxes, with the older mangroves (≥17 years) releasing one-fourth of the CH4 emissions, but double the CO2 flux compared to young stands. Our study suggests that the carbon sink capacity of restored mangrove forests increases with age, but stabilises once they mature (e.g., >17 years). This means that by using carbon sequestration and emissions from natural forests, mangrove restoration projects may be overestimating their carbon sequestration potential.

AB  - The resilience of socio-ecological systems to sea level rise, storms and flooding can be enhanced when coastal habitats are used as natural infrastructure. Grey infrastructure has long been used for coastal flood protection but can lead to unintended negative impacts. Natural infrastructure often provides similar services as well as added benefits that support short- and long-term biological, cultural, social, and economic goals. While natural infrastructure is becoming more widespread in practice, it often represents a relatively small fraction within portfolios of coastal risk-reducing strategies compared to more traditional grey infrastructure. This study provides a comprehensive review of how natural infrastructure is being used along the United States Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean coasts related to four habitats – tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and biogenic reefs. We compare information on the benefits, opportunities and challenges of implementing natural, grey and hybrid infrastructure in the coastal zone. In addition, we present a suite of actions to increase information and reduce uncertainty so that coastal mangers and planners are aware of the full suite of options for restoration, conservation and planning that maximize ecosystem services over short- and long-term planning horizons.

AB  - The recent global calamity of sea level rise and flooding is a major disaster. Some settlements on Java Island, Indonesia, have been reported to be sinking. Bedono Village is one village on the Central Java Coast that is vulnerable to sea level rise. Aside from the possibility of sea level rise, the calamity in this village is linked to prior mangrove degradation and fish pond expansion. This tragedy has displaced 78.63% of the population over a decade, and the remaining population is still surviving in the remaining lands. This study aims to investigate the effects of sea-level rise-related permanent inundation on the lives of the remaining residents in Bedono Village, with a focus on their adaptation and resilience methods. The results disclosed that remaining populations have taken active initiation by adopting multiple strategies that include structural prevention measures and nature based solution through mangrove reforestations. As a result based on mangrove assessment using Geographic Information Systems, mangrove cover increased from 1 ha in 2010 to 9.5 ha in 2012. This achievement has provided an alternative income through mangrove ecotourism. Women and multi stakeholder participation have also contributed to the implementation of adaptation strategy. Despite those significant achievements, the adaptation and resilience was challenged by lack of education and awareness towards sea level rise issues and their confounding disasters. The nature-based solution and local wisdom in Bedono Village is an example that is in line with GPDRR UNDRR 2022, the Sendai Framework, and The Bali Agenda for Resilience that ensures a whole-of-society approach to sea-level rise by ensuring that no one is left behind, creating an inclusive environment, and promoting gender.

AB  - The rapid decline of coral reefs worldwide has led to an increased focus on conservation and restoration of these marvelous ecosystems. Conservation and restoration interventions benefit from scientific data including those that describe species distribution, ocean currents, the abiotic and biotic reef environment, and the degree of disturbance on coral reefs. Various types of omics data are becoming increasingly available for coral reef organisms, and these can also advance coral reef conservation and restoration and can sometimes provide insights that cannot be obtained from other data types. This book brings together genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data for reef-building corals that bear relevance to their protection, describes how these data can be obtained, what their value in coral reef conservation and restoration is and where the field is heading in the near future. This chapter provides an introduction to the book.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to summarize the environmental design applied in terms of the resilience of the coastal front of the cities. The various alternative protective methods and projects are presented, and their applicability and degree of acceptance today are examined. In the context of the integrated environmental planning on the coastal front of the cities, it is considered necessary to adopt the protect - accommodate - retreat target. Regarding the protection measures, beyond the traditional methods of technical works and mechanical shielding of the coastal front, the exploitation of natural infrastructures and ecosystems is presented as relevant alternatives. The current scientific consensus characterizes the use of natural infrastructure towards coastal protection as an innovative and flexible method, easily adaptable to the local circumstances, and with additional environmental benefits to the city. In the case of the coastal cities, these methods are called upon to address challenges that go beyond their nature and relate to the impact of urban physiognomy on them. In terms of such hybrid applications (combination of natural and technical infrastructure) in coastal cities, most of them are recorded in Southeast Asia and USA. New York seems to be the first city in the world that chose to develop and implement hybrid methods of coastal protection. Our research concludes that although natural infrastructure looks initially as the desired and more sustainable solution for the protection of the cities’ coastal front, nevertheless the adoption of hybrid systems, i.e. the combination of technical projects and physical infrastructure, is considered more feasible. In this frame, already located technical projects are utilized and benefits of both methods are exploited, while in parallel the existence of a “double line” of defense increases the levels of protection of the coastal front and integrates smoothly the water element within the city.

AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to examine how the exposure of the coastal population of Kalimantan, Indonesia changed as a result of coastal mangrove loss and population growth. The change of exposure has therefore been calculated through the loss of mangrove biomass, through deforestation and degradation, over time, as well the increase in population living within 10km2 of disturbed mangroves. The results revealed that undisturbed mangroves have been decreasing since 1990 and that deforested and degraded mangroves have followed similar trends. Furthermore, over 20% of the total population of Kalimantan live with 10km of degraded and deforested mangroves. Given that the study covers an extensive area, three hotspots have been identified, where there has been substantial population growth in areas surrounding mangrove forests. A closer look at the governance of mangroves in Indonesia reveals that whilst there are many administrative structures responsible for the management and maintenance of mangroves, there is little cross-collaboration between actors. Furthermore, there is little use of NBS, specifically mangroves within the context of disaster risk reduction. The inclusion of mangroves in Indonesia’s Nationally Determined Contributions as well as the recent implementation of a policy to replant mangroves, shows promise that mangroves will be utilised for their protective services and ability to increase local resilience.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand preferences for different coastal flood protection measures and the factors that influence such preferences, to inform management and policy. The Discrete Choice Experiment applied to Wales residents revealed that there is willingness-to-pay for coastal flood protection, especially through Nature-based Solutions (NbS) including expanding saltmarsh area and increasing saltmarsh with high vegetation. The preference for NbS provides evidence for including specific coastal area targets in financial schemes initially aimed at other benefits from natural habitats, such as habitat creation for biodiversity. This joint action will maximise the benefits from NbS and ensure integrated and concerted efforts across, often disjointed, sectors. There were also high levels of heterogeneity for preferences in different groups of people. For instance, results support that direct flood experience and damage severity can give rise to behavioural intentions that support mitigation and adaptation measures. Findings also highlight how crucial environmental education and direct contact with the object of study are for securing support and buy-in for flood protection measures. This work is original in that it considers the different types of management for a habitat as NbS and the heterogeneity of preferences within a population. Results are significant in providing a basis for future NbS developments and in supporting flood risk policy and management.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to determine the wave dissipation potential of salt marsh vegetation in a temperate, hypertidal estuary. The study site is Clifton Marsh, Nova Scotia, in the Bay of Fundy. This site was selected in part because it is monospecific, with Spartina alterniflora. This research will investigate how effective Spartina alterniflora is at attenuating wave energy and the variability in wave height as the vegetation height increases over time. A transect was set up with 4 RBRduet3 T.D|wave16 — temperature and pressure loggers extending from the mudflat to the vegetated section. Data were collected from mid June to early December 2020. For each two-week dataset, the data was sorted to include only that with a depth greater than 0.1 m, and events were selected to have a significant wave height that is greater than 0.05 m. Vegetation surveys were carried out bi weekly to measure the various parameters such as the stem height, stem diameter and the width of the middle top parts of the leaves. The outcomes show that vegetation has an effect on the wave energy and significant wave height and affects the attenuation capacity of salt marshes. This research demonstrates that the presence of vegetation on salt marshes plays an important role in wave dissipation and attenuation. There needs to be a better understanding of vegetated intertidal environments and incoming waves, to achieve sustainable coastal management and planning.

AB  - The protection, restoration, management, and sustainable use of natural and modified ecosystems to address climate change mitigation have received much global attention in recent years. Those types of actions are, however, often not designed to also address other global challenges, and so they miss an opportunity to provide important non-mitigation benefits and compromise their mitigation potential. Here, we highlight the importance of planning Nature-based Solutions for mitigation while considering the suite of global challenges that societies face, and we propose a set of considerations to ensure that those types of solutions also provide climate adaptation, biodiversity, and/or human well-being benefits. Planning Nature-based Solutions for climate mitigation that can also address other global challenges is very timely because every nature-based effort should grasp the opportunity to address a variety of pressing issues in order to allow for the continued delivery of mitigation and other benefits in this critical decade.

AB  - The prevalence and severity of natural hazards pose a serious risk to food systems, undermining their function to provide food security and improved nutrition. The impact of such events is extensive, and the level of damage and recovery significantly depend on ecosystem services, including their own resilience capacity. This paper provides evidence that the role, value, and utilization of local ecosystem services are essential for food system resilience and for food security in parts of the world where high vulnerability and lack of coping capacity exist to combat climate change. Patterns of ecosystem services-based strategies were revealed that can be introduced to cope and adapt to climate-related natural hazards at the smallholder food system level. The study suggests that food system diversification, technological innovations and nature-based practices, and traditional and indigenous knowledge operationalized across the food system components have a potential for sustaining smallholder resilience in the face of natural hazards.

AB  - The present chapter draws attention to the urgent need to support effective policy responses and identify appropriate nature-based adaptation measures that could be implemented, particularly in low-density coastal areas, for reducing the risk and enhancing the environmental and societal resilience of rural coastal communities to the adverse effects of climate change.Special attention has been paid to rural revival, emphasizing the role of natural capital as a window of economic opportunity for vulnerable rural communities. Natural capital represents a pivotal contributor to encourage inclusive and sustainable growth and promote investments in protecting natural assets, improving the efficiency of natural resource use.While there is considerable relevant research in this field, the debate is still open, and the problem remains challenging for coastal and marine sciences.

AB  - The presence of seagrass along the Romanian coast is currently seen as an important component of the marine ecosystem. Moreover, seagrass meadows play an additional wave energy dissipation role that has also to be considered among other ecosystem services. Assessing the impact of a seagrass meadow on the local hydrodynamics is needed to present an integrated protection and adaption plan for discussion with local stakeholders and coastal managers. The impact on wave heights of a possible seagrass meadow, located in front of the barrier beach at the Mangalia marsh on the southern Romanian coast, has been analysed using numerical modelling. Several seagrass configurations have been studied, for low and average wave conditions from various directions. The same waves were used after adding a vegetation mask to the analysed domain, to simulate the presence of a seagrass meadow. The results of the numerical simulations were extracted in several output points, located along three transects crossing the vegetation mask. They show the most significant reduction in the calculated wave energy density during a year of 16.6%, occurring within the seagrass meadow. Our results suggest that, for the southern Romanian coast, seagrass could be introduced in coastal protection plans as an additional measure for wave attenuation.

AB  - The paper introduces nature-based solutions (NBS) and their application in coastal adaptation management. NBS seek to make use of local natural elements and processes in coastal ecosystems, as much as possible, to harness forces of nature for the benefit of society. We focus on soft sedimentary coasts, like beaches and dunes, salt marshes, seagrass beds and mangroves. By shifting coastal management from conventional ‘Building in Nature' to ‘Building with Nature', NBS can be seen as a valuable alternative to the traditional approach, which is based on hydraulic, civil engineered designs. NBS can be applied in diverse situations and at various scales, from small-scale (ecosystem elements, a small pond) to large-scale (entire coastal stretches). The practice of NBS is also valuable for climate change adaptation, when forces of nature will increase. NBS requires a governance setting that makes use of an integrated approach with disciplines of ecology, economy and society working together. But integration is not yet common practise in many countries. We conclude that NBS are a promising alternative to the traditional approach. Because the practise still is relatively young, more field and laboratory projects should be executed, in particular under extreme weather conditions. The future challenge is to build up more stakeholder acceptance and (local) trust in the concept.

AB  - The onset of a major seagrass initiative in West Africa enabled important seagrass discoveries in several countries, in one of the least documented seagrass regions in the world. Four seagrass species occur in western Africa, Cymodocea nodosa, Halodule wrightii, Ruppia maritima and Zostera noltei. An area of about 62,108 ha of seagrasses was documented in the studied region comprising seven countries: Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Cabo Verde. Extensive meadows of Zostera noltei were recorded for the first time at Saloum Delta, Senegal, which represents the new southernmost distribution limit of this species. This paper also describes the seagrass morphology for some study areas and explores the main stressors to seagrasses as well as conservation initiatives to protect these newly documented meadows in West Africa. The produced information and maps serve as a starting point for researchers and managers to monitor temporal and spatial changes in the meadows’ extent, health and condition as an efficient management tool.

AB  - The oceans and coasts are the Earth’s climate regulators. Covering 72 percent of the planet’s surface, they have absorbed about 40 percent of carbon emitted by human activities since 1850.1 Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows act as deep carbon reservoirs, while marine ecosystems and fauna absorb and sequester greenhouse gases (GHG) through the carbon cycle.2 However, over recent decades, both oceans and coasts have come under pressure from atmospheric and marine warming, habitat destruction, pollution, and the impacts of overfishing and industrial activity. These destructive factors undermine the effect of oceanic systems in reducing atmospheric carbon.

AB  - The ocean, which regulates climate and supports vital ecosystem services, is crucial to our Earth system and livelihoods. Yet, it is threatened by anthropogenic pressures and climate change. A healthy ocean that supports a sustainable ocean economy requires adequate financing vehicles that generate, invest, align, and account for financial capital to achieve sustained ocean health and governance. However, the current finance gap is large; we identify key barriers to financing a sustainable ocean economy and suggest how to mitigate them, to incentivize the kind of public and private investments needed for topnotch science and management in support of a sustainable ocean economy.

AB  - The ocean sustains the global economy and is a critical source of resources, providing food, jobs, livelihoods, and various ecosystem services necessary for human survival. Nonetheless, the development of the blue economy is constrained by a lack of fiscal measures, declining development assistance, and limited funding by private investors through foreign direct investments. Also, some countries face sizeable external debt. As such, developing innovative financial approaches is necessary to accelerate the transition to the blue economy. This chapter will first provide an overview of the various sources of finance to develop the blue economy before discussing the various financing tools available to facilitate this transition.

AB  - The ocean plays a central role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, climate and ocean policies have been historically siloed. After decades of slow convergence, the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue, decided at COP25 and launched online in December 2020, was the first forum for Parties and non-Party stakeholders to the UNFCCC to give their perspectives on how the climate regime should address ocean-related mitigation and adaptation. The Ocean Dialogue was informed by 47 prior open submissions provided by a broad swath of actors from across the UN system and from civil society, including traditional and youth voices. Our analysis of the submissions demonstrates a political evolution towards the nexus among climate, ocean, and biodiversity regimes. The submissions uniformly acknowledge that ocean and climate systems are inextricably linked, and that consideration of ocean-based action will strengthen climate action and vice versa. Salient themes of the submissions include changing ocean impacts, carbon sinks and blue carbon opportunities, and the need for ecosystem resilience, biodiversity management and improved understanding of normative and institutional frameworks. There is a strong call to recognize the interconnectedness of the biophysical world. Similar themes emerged during the actual Ocean Dialogue and the subsequent informal meeting on next steps. The main message conveyed is the dire necessity to implement strong stewardship and good governance of the blue planet in a disrupted climate using cooperative and concrete actions. This analysis highlights the need for a continued transdisciplinary international dialogue on the ocean and climate change which elevates the ocean-climate-biodiversity nexus via collaborative science, finance, and policy.

AB  - The ocean is vital for life on earth and yet it is under serious threat from climate change and resource overexploitation. Environmental change in the ocean significantly undermines human livelihoods, especially in the developing and least developed countries where people are particularly vulnerable to climate change-related losses and damages. This Briefing Paper outlines challenges that people, development cooperation and policy face and suggests ways forward for sustainable ocean governance through sustainable resource use, comprehensive risk management and enhanced climate action. Life in the ocean is threatened in various ways by human activities. Climate change, as one severe consequence, leads to ocean warming and ocean acidification putting complex ecosystems and their sensitive species in danger. Such climatic impacts are exacerbated by pollution, especially plastic, and the overharvesting of many marine species. As a result of the confluence of these developments, many local coastal communities lose their livelihoods. At the same time, climate change increasingly threatens coasts through sea level rise, salinisation and growing frequencies of extreme weather events, such as floods and storms. This puts the 2.6 billion people living at or near the coasts at high risk; low-altitude small islands are expected to become uninhabitable within the next decades if current global warming trajectories continue. Furthermore, the ocean contributes to climate change mitigation because marine ecosystems absorb CO2. In response to these challenges, there is a need for sustained awareness raising on the importance of the ocean for development as well as for the need of enhanced international cooperation for joint action. Conscious politics, substantial action and financial resources are needed at multiple levels of governance, from empowering local stakeholders to developing locally sound solutions to political guidance through national and international policy-making processes. From a development policy angle, this Briefing Paper specifically suggests that current climate and biodiversity policy processes pay enhanced attention to the ocean under climate change, pollution and overexploitation stress. This should be guided by the overarching vision of a sustainable blue economy. More concrete reform needs are a stronger focus on responsible stakeholder inclusion at all levels in ocean governance in general, ranging from individual households to communities, private sector and governments; expansion of marine protected areas and promotion of marine and coastal nature-based solutions to complement sustainable blue economies while ensuring their inclusive and rights-based governance; support for sustainable small-scale fisheries and promotion of eco-friendly mariculture and aquaculture; expansion of the reach of the UNFCCC's Nairobi Work Programme and the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) to oceans and coasts; and support for radical decarbonisation pathways and a carbon-neutral blue economy.

AB  - The ocean is life sustaining. But, it is also a mighty force which can pose great danger to those living along its coasts. As a means of protection, we’ve armored our coastlines with grey infrastructure. However, these structures are expensive to build and maintain, encourage further development in areas particularly susceptible to flooding and storm damage, and often fail. In order for coastal communities across the globe to survive in a climate-changed future, nature must be prioritized in our regulatory, financial, and social systems in ways which empower, encourage, and incentivize smart and necessary investments in natural infrastructure.

AB  - The objective of this report is to address identified SDG14 issues with factual data and state of the art knowledge and experiences. The Government of the Netherlands should be active on the oceans agenda due to the consequences of climate change, the production of sustainable proteins for food production, the provision of growth and employment, maintaining world leadership in coastal protection and water management; water innovation; circular economy and dealing with the problem of marine pollution. Almost half of the world's seabirds and marine mammals have ingested plastic marine litter and almost every marine organism is contaminated with synthetic chemicals. As a result of policy measures, riverine loads of nitrogen and phosphorus have reduced since the 1990s. However, in the Dutch Caribbean eutrophication is a major stressor for coral reefs and seagrass meadows. Considering acidification it is estimated that impacts on molluscs and tropical coral reefs will cost over USD 1,000 billion annually by the end of the century. Climate change will cause sea level rise but the Netherlands is well equipped to deal with this in the coming century. New monitoring techniques consist of remote sensing via satellite imagery and aquatic and airborne drones. These techniques facilitate the monitoring of eutrophication and plastics and other pressures so that effective policy measures can be taken. The role of the Regional Seas Programmes is to implement the international agenda on marine and coastal issues. The strategies of RSPs consist of reducing pollution, resilience for people and ecosystems, integrated ecosystembased policies and enhancing effectiveness. Regional Seas Conventions are the instrument to implement RSPs. The Government of the Netherlands regards RSCs as essential for effective ocean governance

AB  - The objective of this paper is to recommend planning options for improving the resilience, competitiveness, and sustainability of coastal cities. Insights for an improved understanding of dynamic coastal ecosystems and tourism impacts are shared. These are based on project level solutions and experiential knowledge of practices and a literature review of impacts of (a) growing pressures from coastal tourism in cities, (b) urban and environmental management practices, and (c) prevailing processes for creating and managing coastal infrastructure. Solutions to the identified problems are based on an analysis of the coastal ecosystems across three broad pillars: (i) city management, (ii) pollution and climate change risks, and (iii) coastal tourism. The problems range from a fragmented approach to coastal infrastructure planning; land and water pollution, fragmentation of natural ecosystems' loss of habitat and unique biodiversity, salinity intrusion, and climate change risks from sea level rises and natural disasters; and tourism economy dependencies on the management of natural assets and cross-sectoral planning. The paper recommends paradigm shifts for innovative planning and policy approaches that engage communities, institutions, and other stakeholders.

AB  - The notion of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (DRR) has only recently emerged in Indonesia. The Indonesian central government now adopts some policies related to ecosystem-based DRR with formal commitments from local administrations. At the implementation level, various activities have taken place, such as mangrove planting and restoration along the coastline to address the rising sea level and the “one billion trees” program to address the urgent issue of deforestation. These governmental activities have involved local communities that reside in the high-risk area, while nonlocal actors, particularly from the private and the nongovernmental sectors, have contributed as a third element to development. This paper examines space management in the context of Eco-DRR, paying special attention to uncertainty and anxiety in the local communities as the government and private sectors engage in development activities that have significant impacts on their present and future lives. The present study pursues this purpose by means of in-depth interview and focus group discussions (FGD) with local leaders in mangrove planting and restoration programs. The study took place in a small island community in a part of the Jakarta Megapolitan Region, Indonesia. The results point out that the community feels left behind due to lack of trust in managing the conservation space. Another issue to be addressed is how to improve the democratization of environment management and livelihood base of the local community. Therefore, building confidence and ameliorating relationships between actors within/without the local community should lead to a better Eco-DRR initiative.

AB  - The North Atlantic Basin (NAB) is seeing a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones since the 1980s, with record-breaking seasons such as 2017 and 2020. However, little is known about how coastal ecosystems, particularly mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, are responding to these new “climate normals” at regional and subregional scales. Wind speed, rainfall, pre-cyclone forest structure, and hydro-geomorphology are known to influence mangrove damage and recovery following cyclones in the NAB. However, these studies have focused on site-specific responses and individual cyclonic events. Here, we analyze 25 years (1996-2020) of mangrove vulnerability (damage after a cyclone) and short-term resilience (recovery after damage) for the entire NAB and its subregions, using multi-annual, remote sensing-derived databases. We applied machine learning to characterize the influence of 22 potential drivers that include previously researched variables and new ones such as human development and long-term climate trends. The characteristics of the cyclones mainly drive vulnerability at the regional level, while resilience is largely driven by site-specific conditions. These include long-term climate conditions, such as air temperature and drought trends, pre-cyclone habitat conditions, such as canopy cover and height and soil organic carbon stock, and human interventions on the land. Rates and drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience vary across subregions in the NAB, and hotspots for restoration and conservation actions are highlighted within subregions. The impacts of increasing cyclone activity need to be framed in the context of climate change compound effects and heavy human influences in the region. There is an urgent need to value the restoration and conservation of mangroves as fundamental Nature-based Solutions against cyclone impacts in the NAB.

AB  - The negative impacts of climate change call for an urgent global response, to mitigate emissions and strengthen the adaptive capacity of social, economic, and environmental structures. In Latin America and the Caribbean, in a context of high vulnerability and three simultaneous crises affecting the region, development models need to be transformed, to bring about a sustainable transition. During this process, national and local policies must harness the full potential of climate action, through adoption of new technologies, innovation, productive reorganization, and identification of synergies. This is why nature-based solutions and carbon dioxide removal measures and technologies are critical to achieving climate goals. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the opportunities and challenges of large-scale implementation of such measures in the region, emphasizing the need to accelerate ongoing efforts, expand the research frontier and manage risks.

AB  - The need to reduce risks from coastal storms and climate change in coastal areas has given rise to efforts to make greater use of integrated ecosystem-based approaches. Assessment of the role and cost efficiency of adaptation measures is increasingly demanded. Applying the Economics of Climate Adaptation framework in the US Gulf Coast, we compare nature-based defenses, artificial defenses, and policy measures for adaptation and risk reduction and quantify their costs and benefits under a variety of economic growth and climate change scenarios. Our analyses are spatially explicit and all models, tools and information are open source. The framework includes (i) a probabilistic assessment of hazards, (ii) estimation of damages and (iii) assessment of adaptation and risk reduction measures. We perform sensitivity analyses to understand the parameters that created the most variation in risk assessment and most influenced estimates of cost effectiveness. We find that high rates of economic growth and coastal development are likely to create greater risks in the near term than climate change, due to the increase in exposed assets. Nature-based solutions such as oyster reef and marsh restoration are particularly cost effective, but their cost-effectiveness is highly dependent on where these measures are used. As decision-makers look for the most cost effective group of measures for adaptation and risk reduction, these approaches and results should be particularly useful for informing management priorities.

AB  - The need to develop more sustainable solutions for coastal hazard risk reduction and to protect and restore degraded coastal habitats has led to an increased interest in living shorelines. A barrier to the wider implementation of living shorelines is a lack of guidance on where it is suitable to implement these solutions. We developed a shoreline suitability model to select areas of a representative coastline that would be either suitable for a soft (natural habitats only) or hybrid (natural habitats in combination with hard structures) approaches. We created species distribution models in MaxEnt to predict the potential distribution of 14 coastal species including four seagrasses, one mangrove, three saltmarsh, three shellfish and three dune species. These were combined in a multi-criteria analysis that also accounted for the accommodation (current space in the intertidal) and adaptation space (amount of space between the intertidal and nearest infrastructure) available to implement living shorelines at a 250 m resolution. This was done for the state of Victoria, Australia as a case study location where there is a high percentage of coastal infrastructure reaching the end of its design life. For the Victorian coastline 74% was suitable for hybrid approaches, while 65% was suitable for soft approaches and 4% of the coastline was not suitable for either approach. For the coastline already protected with hard defence structures, 67 and 69% would be suitable for at least one taxa, using a soft or hybrid approach, respectively. The percentage of coastline suitable for soft or hybrid approaches was similar in rural areas, however, suitability for hybrid was greater than soft approaches in urban and built-up areas, which could be due to a combination of habitat suitability and space available on the foreshore. This study has demonstrated how spatial multi-criteria analysis can be adapted to a complex coastal environment and inform more diverse coastal hazard mitigation actions to risk reduction and climate adaptation.

AB  - The need for sustainable and resilient long-term strategies for coastal restoration and development projects is largely the result of pressures brought by changing climate conditions and growing human populations along coastal boundaries. As anthropogenic impacts along our coasts increase, the demand for sustainable, nature-based solutions (NbS) will grow commensurately. Trusted approaches are needed for successful implementation of NbS, especially in regions hardest hit by environmental changes. Nearshore strategies for new construction and protection of existing coastal infrastructure are shifting rapidly from hardened approaches to more ecologically aligned techniques that work with natural forces and enhance natural habitat. This paper highlights the benefits of living shorelines composed of ecotypic native plants, wave attenuation structures for coastal protection, and managed retreat to restore coastal environments while supporting and maintaining natural habitats. We review several NbS and present two case studies to illustrate the value of incorporating nature-based approaches to vulnerable coastal environments and highlight the importance of maximizing synergies and understanding trade-offs in their long-term use.

AB  - The nearshore rocky reef environment is an ecosystem of great ecological and economic importance. Rocky reefs are hotspots of biodiversityand many marine food webs around the world rely on primary producers thatreside on rocky, or hard-bottom substrate. Along the west coast of North 3America, the presence of rocky reefs can be considered the first order control for the existence and distribution of marine biota. Like all ecosystemson our planet, rocky reefs face disruptions due to continued changes in the climate over the coming decades. Understanding the response of these ecosystems to climate stressors is crucial for informing management and restoration policies on local, regional, and national scales. Creating an accurate inventory of existing reefs is a crucial first step in quantifying the potential impacts of climate change on these habitats. Advances in remote sensing techniques, specifically airborne LiDAR survey methods provide an opportunity for scientists to quantify nearshore habitats at previously unachievable scales. This paper presents both a methodology for mapping the spatial distribution of rocky reefs, as well as an example of the climate impact assessments that can be conducted once these areas are accurately quantified. The study is therefore divided into two parts. First, a methodologyis presented for mapping the extent of rocky reef habitats at high resolutions, using bathymetric measurements from airborne LiDAR surveys. The proposed algorithm extracts roughness values from topo-bathymetric LiDAR data, compares results to existing in situ surveys and classifies substrate as rocky or sandy at 1x1 meter resolution. Second, the effects of different sea level rise (SLR) scenarios on the distribution of rocky reef habitats are explored. After mapping the rocky substrate at two study sites in the San Diego region, a range of SLR scenarios were applied to a depth-stratified ecological model of the local nearshore ecosystems to assess changes in the spatial distribution of key primary producers. This analysis showed a loss in overall habitat area and a shoreward shift in the distributionof rocky nearshore habitats especially in the intertidal zone and in shallow waters populated by surfgrass. The outcomes of this study include both a viable methodology for creating inventories of nearshore rocky reefs at largescales, along with the results of the subsequent SLR assessment. Both avenues of inquiry explored in this study can be expanded upon by future research.

The goal of these research efforts is to reduce the potential risks of sea-level rise (SLR) and storm-surge in Texas by utilizing the Sea-level Affecting Marsh Migration (SLAMM) model and new high-resolution LiDAR data to produce a series of spatial indices for coastal restoration and protection for San Antonio and Copano Bay estuarine systems. These indices are designed to promote healthy coastal ecosystems and identify nature-based solutions to sea-level rise, focusing on marsh habitat viability along the Texas central coast and opportunities for marsh restoration and community adaptation.

AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is significantly affected by human activities, climate change, and rising sea level. The propagules of mangroves dispersal with tide and river currents that extend upstream habitats are why mangroves are the dominant species in the tidal area. Bridging critical knowledge gaps can help to create restoration plans for mangrove extension. However, studies on the hydrodynamic and propagation trajectory model (PTM) simulation of propagule long-distance dispersal (LDD) and mangrove growth potential are scarce. By combining various numerical methods and empirical formulas and verifying them with the data obtained through field surveys, this study established a comprehensive model to assess the dispersal and growth of the propagules of Kandelia ovobata. The stepping-stone approach (SSA) and habitat suitability index (HSI) model were also employed to determine the location of the appropriate new habitats through iterative simulation in propagule dispersal. Dike removal was proposed as a nature-based solution and modeled to evaluate the benefits of ecological conservation and flood prevention. The PTM simulations indicated that the deterministic process of horizontal advection accounted for >80 %, and that the remaining variability in the model could be explained by stochastic processes in predicting mangrove propagules pathways. The integrated model of the PTM and SSA proved that propagules have LDD in an estuary. There were few matches in the regions for mangrove growth when comparing the suitability of habitat distribution and the probability of propagule movement. We suggested that the mangrove spread model incorporating the SSA and HSI models predict the potential for mangrove dispersal into new habitats. In addition, the removal of levees aids floodplain regeneration and allows propagules to disperse across the floodplain at high tide and establishment at low tide. The Guandu floodplain restoration with dike removal supplied a cobenefits on ecological demands and flood risk reduction. Future research could thus utilize the adaptation and mitigation strategies presented in this study by incorporating socioeconomic considerations to enhance practical feasibility.

AB  - The limitations of dominant approaches to managing coastal flood risk that rely on technical, hard, grey infrastructures have become more evident, and nature-based flood defences (NBFD) have been gaining attention in coastal climate change adaptation. This study explores the barriers and possibilities of transitioning toward NBFD, focusing on how path dependency can be overcome to implement NBFD in coastal areas. Through a systematic literature review, a conceptual framework is developed to identify lock-ins as well as enabling factors that can overcome path dependency and facilitate implementing NBFD. The framework is then applied to three NBFD case studies that are widely considered to be success stories from the Global North and South: (i) The Wide Green Dike (WGD), (ii) the Living Breakwaters, and (iii) Mangrove Plantation Projects (MPP). Through document review and 16 expert interviews, the research identified case- and context-specific lock-ins and enablers in the implementation of each case study. The study shows that the key factors causing lock-ins differ more amongst case studies than factors breaking path dependency. Insufficient data and/or technology and gaps in coordination significantly influenced all three case studies, although this took different forms. Aversion to change was a significant influence in the WGD and LB case study, which impacted the trust and uptake of NBFD. The MPP has more lock-ins than the other two case studies, including knowledge gap, lack of financial resources, and overdependence on local knowledge. Regarding factors breaking path-dependency, collaboration, leadership, and available funding resources were important for all three case studies, and past flooding events triggered changes in the approach to FRM. Community engagement has also been identified as a critical factor and was especially important in the MPP case study. In sum, the study showed that the lock-ins and enablers differ not only between the Global South and North cases but also between the two Global North Cases, and they interact in both causing and breaking lock-ins. Lastly, the findings inform guiding principles and recommendations for policymakers, planners, and key decision-makers on successfully overcoming lock-ins to implement the appropriate NBFD in the future.

AB  - The Large Wave Flume (Großer Wellenkanal, GWK) is the key facility of the coastal research center Forschungszentrum Küste (FZK), a joint institution of Leibniz University Hannover and Technische Universität Braunschweig. GWK is one of the few facilities of this kind worldwide allowing for physical model tests under well controlled conditions and with minimized or even negligible scale effects. The flume is in operation since 1983 and used to be even the largest facility of its kind until recently. This paper is intended to give a short overview of the capabilities of GWK and the experience gained over the last 35 years. Recent developments in measurement techniques allow for easier, more precise and more detailed measurements than in the earlier days of GWK and have increased the value of the experiments significantly. This will be demonstrated and discussed by typical examples from each of the four research topics at FZK: (i) coastal structures; (ii) sediment transport; (iii) marine energy; (iv) ecohydraulics.

AB  - The IPCC’s “Summary for Policy Makers” focuses on global issues and trends. This in-depth report distils from it the richest material available on Latin America. Extreme weather events can create cascading impacts on people and the environment. Coastal ecosystems such as sea grasses and mangroves are affected by ocean warming including acidification, loss of oxygen, salinity intrusion and sea level rise. Changes underway in glacier-fed rivers cannot be reversed. Protecting and restoring what is called coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems such as mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows can help mitigate climate change by locking up carbon. Types of adaptation actions include wetland conservation and restoration, and hard coastal protection and managed realignment.

AB  - The interaction between waves and flexible blades has drawn recent attention because of the capacity of nature-based infrastructure, such as aquatic vegetation and kelp, to attenuate waves. In this study, a new numerical model was developed to study the wave-blade interaction for both bottom-fixed and suspended blades. The dynamics of the blades simulated by a cable model were coupled with OpenFOAM®-based wave model IHFoam with the immersed boundary method. The results showed that the distribution of the blade-induced vortices was asymmetric with more vortices upstream for the single bottom-fixed blade while more vortices downstream for the single suspended blade. For both submerged and suspended canopies, the vortex distribution is also asymmetric. More vortices concentrate upstream for the submerged canopy. For a suspended canopy, more vortices concentrate upstream and below the bottom of the suspended canopy. Yet near the surface above the suspended canopy, more vortices concentrate downstream. Understanding the distribution of vortices is important for predicting the sediment transport and nutrient distribution.

AB  - The increasing risk of flooding requires obtaining generalized knowledge for the implementation of distinct and innovative intervention strategies, such as nature-based solutions. Inclusion of ecosystems in flood risk management has proven to be an adaptive strategy that achieves multiple benefits. However, obtaining generalizable quantitative information to increase the reliability of such interventions through experiments or numerical models can be expensive, laborious, or computationally demanding. This paper presents a probabilistic model that represents interconnected elements of vegetated hydrodynamic systems using a nonparametric Bayesian network (NPBN) for seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves. NPBNs allow for a system-level probabilistic description of vegetated hydrodynamic systems, generate physically realistic varied boundary conditions for physical or numerical modeling, provide missing information in data-scarce environments, and reduce the amount of numerical simulations required to obtain generalized results—all of which are critically useful to pave the way for successful implementation of nature-based solutions.

AB  - The increasing impacts of climate hazards combined with the loss of coastal habitats require urgent solutions to manage risk. Storm losses continue to grow and much of them are uninsured. These losses represent an increasing burden to individuals, businesses, and can jeopardize national development goals. Pre-hazard mitigation is cost effective, but both the public and private sector struggle to finance up-front investments in it. This article explores a resilience solution that combines risk transfer (e.g., insurance) with risk reduction (e.g., hazard mitigation), which have often been treated as two separate mechanisms for disaster risk management. The combined mechanism could help align environmental and risk management goals and create opportunities for public and private investment in nature-based projects. We assessed this resilience insurance with hypothetical cases for coral reef restoration. Under conservative assumptions, 44% of the initial reef restoration costs would be covered just by insurance premium reductions in the first 5 years, with benefits amounting >6 times the total costs over 25 years. We also test the sensitivity to key factors such as project cost, risk reduction potential, insurance structure, economic exposure and discount rates. The resilience insurance mechanism is applicable to many coastlines and can help finance nature-based adaptation.

AB  - The implementation of nature-based solutions (NBSs) can be a suitable and sustainable approach to coping with environmental issues related to diffuse water pollution from agriculture. NBSs exploit natural mitigation processes that can promote the removal of different contaminants from agricultural wastewater, and they can also enable the recovery of otherwise lost resources (i.e., nutrients). Among these, nitrogen impacts different ecosystems, resulting in serious environmental and human health issues. Recent research activities have investigated the capability of NBS to remove nitrogen from polluted water. However, the regulating mechanisms for nitrogen removal can be complex, since a wide range of decontamination pathways, such as plant uptake, microbial degradation, substrate adsorption and filtration, precipitation, sedimentation, and volatilization, can be involved. Investigating these processes is beneficial for the enhancement of the performance of NBSs. The present study provides a comprehensive review of factors that can influence nitrogen removal in different types of NBSs, and the possible strategies for nitrogen recovery that have been reported in the literature.

It must adapt to rising temperatures, more extreme storms, and floods, rising sea levels, more intense heatwaves, and longer and more severe droughts. Yet though the risks are great, so also are the opportunities that successful adaptation can bring.

AB  - The impacts of sea level rise under a changing climate negatively affect the world’s coastal zones and threaten livelihood opportunities of the dependent communities, thereby highlighting the need for improved coastal adaptation strategies. The study employed a two-step methodology (i.e. bibliometric and systematic review) to analyse the geospatiality of sea level rise impacts and communities’ adaptation. In total, 363 papers were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases, and 292 were considered eligible and used for the bibliometric analysis. In the systematic review, the study aimed for specific community adaptation strategies from the 292 papers, and 118 papers were eligible following developed criteria. Results indicate that countries are committed to helping their coastal communities to adapt to sea level rise impacts and the USA has been significant in that regard. Coastal communities adapt to sea level rise impacts by increasing their structural/physical or social options; however, policy/institutional assistance to intensify these options is limited. Also, specific community adaptation strategies to sea level rise impacts have been more of the engineered and built environment (67%) strategies and few on ecosystem-based strategies (7%). More ecosystem-based strategies are, thus, needed considering their socio-ecological benefits. Further research and increased communities-policymakers engagement for enhanced adaptive capacity is required.

AB  - The impacts of climate change are increasingly being felt around the world and drawing attention to the critical need for climate mitigation and adaptation efforts from our governments. Reducing flood risk is particularly important because populations are increasingly moving into floodprone areas. Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate-related disasters and many communities lack human and financial capacity to cope with the impacts of climate change. While different types of climate adaptation options exist, nature-based solutions (NBS) have the potential to provide both socioeconomic and ecological benefits and are increasingly seen as valuable interventions. This report seeks to identify barriers, opportunities, and guiding principles for successful implementation of NBS to reduce flood risk and improve the lives of local communities. Barriers to implementation have been identified based on a literature review and include path dependency towards hard engineered solutions, the focus on one-size-fits-all solutions, a lack of knowledge and awareness of NBS, a lack of collaborative decision-making, a lack of interest and prioritization of NBS, inappropriate spatial planning, a lack local adaptive capacity, and social equity concerns related to NBS. Various opportunities for implementation have also been highlighted, such as improving policies to better integrate climate change adaptation (CCA) into development plans, integrating CCA and NBS into spatial planning, improving local access to technical and financial support to increase uptake of NBS, prioritizing inclusive decision-making, and promoting context-specific design. Two case studies are presented, including Building with Nature (BwN) in Indonesia and Enhancing Climate Change Resilience of Rural Communities living in Protected Areas (AFCPA) in Cambodia. The case studies are evaluated using guiding principles for successful implementation of NBS, including (1) context relevance, (2) evidence base, (3) integration into wider context, (4) social equity, and (5) collaborative decision-making. It is found that the case studies have been successful at implementing NBS projects and incorporating these guiding principles to varying degrees. The report highlights the importance of these guiding principles in NBS projects and draws lessons learned from the case studies and literature review. Although the presented case studies focus on Southeast Asian countries, findings in this report are relevant to all cities seeking to reduce flood risk through nature-based interventions.

Such co-management options can be effective to realize the targets for Sustainable Development Goals 14 (SDG 14) for 2030. At present, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) provides the MFAs on a daily basis by using a combination of data from satellite imageries and ground-based datasets. However, sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems services needs to be informed by appropriate technological models of resources usage, including the incorporation of coastal zone management plans as per NbS frameworks for achieving long-term successes. The present study highlights the need to adopt NbS and MFAs as co-management approaches for adaptation and/or mitigation of the impacts of climatic and environmental factors as well as for fostering sustainable fishing initiatives for the Bay of Bengal. Such integrative methodologies are crucial for the development of model-based policy frameworks for sustainable marine resources management. Accordingly, an assessment of the NbS techniques for deriving a new adaptive framework is presented and discussed in the context of consideration of MFAs as NbS Assisting Technologies (NAT) to obtain significant co-benefits for sustainable development.

AB  - The idea of nature providing solutions to societal challenges is relatively easy to understand by the layperson. Nature-based solutions (NBS) against landslides and erosion mostly comprise plant-based interventions in which the reinforcement of slopes provided by vegetation plays a crucial role in natural hazard prevention and mitigation, and in the provision of multiple socio-ecological benefits. However, the full potential of NBS against landslides and erosion is not realised yet because a strong evidence base on their multi-functional performance is lacking, hindering the operational rigour of NBS practice and science. This knowledge gap can be addressed through the definition of repositories of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics, which should stem from holistic frameworks facilitating the multi-functional assessment of NBS. Herein, we propose the ‘rocket framework’ to promote the uptake of NBS against landslides and erosion through the provision of a comprehensive set of indicators which, through their appropriate selection and measurement, can contribute to build a robust evidence base on NBS performance. The 'rocket framework’ is holistic, reproducible, dynamic, versatile, and flexible in helping define metrics for NBS actions against landslides and erosion along the NBS project timeline. The framework, resultant from an iterative research approach applied in a real-world environment, follows a hierarchical approach to deal with multiple scales and environmental contexts, and to integrate environmental, eco-engineering, and socio-ecological domains, thus establishing a balance between monitoring the engineering performance of NBS actions against landslides and erosion, and the wider provision of ecosystem functions and services. Using a case study, and following the principles of credibility, salience, legitimacy, and feasibility, we illustrate herein how the 'rocket framework’ can be effectively employed to define a repository with over 40 performance indicators for monitoring NBS against landslides and erosion, and with over 60 metrics for establishing the context and baseline upon which the NBS are built and encourage their reproduction and upscaling.

AB  - The historical, present, and projected future risk of coastal flooding necessitates measures to protect coastal communities and environments, including using natural defences such as mangroves. Estimates of extent of flood protection provided by mangrove forests range widely, probably because of differences in growth characteristic of trees combined with variations in local geomorphology in each case study site. Here we use a Delft3D model of a mangrove forest in Tauranga, Aotearoa New Zealand, with vegetation flow resistance parameterized by frontal area, as a basis of idealized scenarios designed to explore and generalize the impact of channels, vegetation density, and forest slope on long wave (surge/tide) attenuation. Previous models often parameterise the frictional effect of mangroves with high bottom friction, which we show using theoretical arguments, becomes increasingly problematic with larger amplitude flood events. However, the contorted forms of the shrubby Avicenna mangroves at the field site necessitate new ways to quantify vegetation density more accurately for modelling. Nevertheless, modelling experiments show that vegetation distribution and channelization have a greater impact on flood attenuation than vegetation density, with large events resulting in less attenuation than smaller events due to the increased hydraulic efficiency associated with increased water depth. Additionally, a forest with sloping topography reduces the rate at which long wave attenuation occurs. Implications are that mangroves can only be effective coastal flood protection if the larger scale (forest-scale) distribution of vegetation also contributes to reducing the landward flow of water.

AB  - The health and integrity of coral reef ecosystems are in decline worldwide due to an increasing suite of human activities, which threaten biodiversity and human wellbeing. One of the major drivers of coral reef ecosystem decline is poor water quality from human activities on land. Land-based pollutants from human activities travel downstream via watersheds - through groundwater flow and land areas drained by streams – and are funnelled into coastal environments. There is now ample evidence of the linkages between human activities in watersheds and elevated levels of pollutants in water discharged to coastal marine ecosystems. There is also a growing understanding of the myriad and often interacting impacts these pollutants have on coral reef ecosystems and the critical services they provide for associated dependent communities. This white paper reviews the linkages between land-based runoff and coral reef ecosystems, with four specific objectives to: (1) review how sediments, nutrients, chemicals, and pathogens affect corals and reef-associated organisms at a variety of life stages; (2) assess how these processes impact associated dependent human populations; (3) identify existing knowledge needs; and (4) provide science-based management options. Improving the management of upstream human activities within watersheds has great potential to alleviate the severe local threats of poor water quality on coral reef ecosystems and preserve the critical functions and services they provide (e.g., tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection). Improving water quality can reduce coral disease risk and increase vital biological functions needed for corals to grow (e.g., reproduction), which also improves the resilience of corals to global impacts such as climate change. Yet, despite the breadth of research demonstrating critical land-sea linkages for coral reef ecosystem health, there are few standout examples of successful improvements to coral reef ecosystem condition that can be directly linked to upstream management action. This is largely because investments in both interventions and monitoring often need to be large in scale and sustained over long (i.e., decadal) periods to detect measurable downstream impacts. There are also a variety of human health impacts resulting directly from poor water quality flowing within watersheds onto coastal environments. The direct impacts to human health from declining water quality include: (1) enhanced transmission of diseases (e.g., gastrointestinal and upper respiratory diseases); (2) reduced food availability and nutritional deficit from decline of fisheries associated with coral reef habitat; and (3) food poisoning from consumption of seafood contaminated with pollutants and pathogens. Poor water quality is consequently a major contributor to global disease burdens and conservatively estimated to cost 12 billion USD in economic losses annually, a cost disproportionately borne by the poorest countries (Alhamlan et al. 2015). The overlapping drivers of coral reef and human health from watershed alteration provides an opportunity to create strategic management interventions within watersheds that will address the goals of both the conservation and public health sectors and enhance human and ecosystem health outcomes. This paper presents innovative solutions that incentivize the large-scale, sustained action required to both improve water quality in watersheds and prevent water quality impacts on coral reef ecosystems. The solutions use holistic approaches to integrated watershed management that bridge social and ecological systems and provide important co-benefits to human wellbeing. Focusing on the combined economic, human health and wellbeing impacts across linked watersheds and reef areas can motivate action and leverage investment that result in co-benefits across multiple sectors. Designing appropriate solutions, therefore, requires taking a multi-sector, systems approach, that accounts for both social and ecological systems, with collaboration required across environmental, agr cultural, public health, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sectors, and across the land-sea interface. Having a wide range of informed stakeholders sharing resources and taking an integrated approach will assist in buffering risks and create more effective and proactive governance. We provide several recommendations of key actions to promote successful outcomes for nature and people from improved watershed management: -Undertake risk assessments to identify main sources of land-based impacts to coral reef ecosystems, and consider where these risks overlap with risks to public health, especially in the context of future climate change scenarios. -Ensure engagement of the full range of actors, landowners, and beneficiaries within watershed boundaries and provide platforms for transparent, participatory planning, and decision-making. -Develop guidance materials to integrate coral reef ecosystem health into integrated watershed management, public health, and WASH planning. -Engage and/or establish multi-sector management authorities (e.g., watershed commissions) with the mandate and resources to coordinate action across marine resource users/managers, logging, mining, agricultural, public health, and WASH sectors. -Undertake policy gap analysis to improve implementation of existing policies and identify opportunities to strengthen best-practice management guidelines for land use including logging, mining, food production, and wastewater treatment to properly account for downstream human and ecosystem health impacts. -Conduct research and synthesis to improve the quantity and quality of data available on thresholds and indicators of water quality and impacts on coral reef ecosystems, and make the information easily accessible (i.e., through an open-source water quality database) to support monitoring and assessment programs. -Develop/enhance sustainable and innovative financing mechanisms, through impact investment and private sector engagement, business case studies and integrated resource mobilization strategies, to provide the resources required to implement phased, integrated watershed management interventions across nested scales. -Advocate for integrated watershed management in places where pollution is likely to undermine other conservation interventions being implemented (e.g., within marine protected areas). -Document the process of developing and implementing integrated watershed management strategies in order to create communication materials for the broader conservation, WASH and public health communities on lessons learned.

AB  - The growing interest in incorporating nature-based solutions and ecosystem services as part of coastal protection schemes has recently increased in the literature and focused on the understanding and modeling of wave and current interactions with natural coastal landforms, such as salt marshes. With this purpose, using flumes or basins has been one of the preferred options in experimental modeling under controlled conditions. However, due to the inherent complexities associated with this approach, most of the previously published experiments are based on wave-flume experiments using vegetation mimics. The current demand for understanding the relevant processes requires a step forward, which includes experimental modeling with real vegetation on both a relevant large scale and at a sufficiently large water depth. In response to foreseen needs, this study provides useful guidance based on the experience gained from a unique set of experiments conducted in a large wave basin, including wave and current interaction with real salt marsh vegetation. This study reports on plant collection and growing strategies, plant properties, physical set-up, instrumentation, and experimental strategy and dismantling, providing guidelines aimed at being helpful for future experimental efforts at the interface of engineering and ecology.

AB  - The geographic landscape is a recurrent unit of analysis in vulnerability studies. Single descriptions are often used to show the elements exposed in these landscapes. However, the concept requires specifying the components of the landscape and its functioning as a unit. Thus, the purpose of this research was to use the analysis of Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) to describe the global contribution of landscape elements to human activities, prioritizing the units in which the effects of climate change may imply greater impacts on the human population. For this, we analyzed six categories of nature’s contributions applied to the landscape units in a fragment of the Mexican Pacific coast. The units with mangrove cover had the highest nature contributions. It is expected that the application of this approach in the exposure component of vulnerability studies will allow a better understanding of the non-return relationship and the search for adaptive nature-based solutions.

AB  - The Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) delta is one of the most disaster-prone areas in the world due to a combination of high population density and exposure to tropical cyclones, floods, salinity intrusion and other hazards. Due to the complexity of natural deltaic processes and human influence on these processes, structural solutions like embankments are inadequate on their own for effective hazard mitigation. This article examines nature-based solutions (NbSs) as a complementary or alternative approach to managing hazards in the GB delta. We investigate the potential of NbS as a complementary and sustainable method for mitigating the impacts of coastal disaster risks, mainly cyclones and flooding. Using the emerging framework of NbS principles, we evaluate three existing approaches: tidal river management, mangrove afforestation, and oyster reef cultivation, all of which are actively being used to help reduce the impacts of coastal hazards. We also identify major challenges (socioeconomic, biophysical, governance and policy) that need to be overcome to allow broader application of the existing approaches by incorporating the NbS principles. In addition to addressing GB delta-specific challenges, our findings provide more widely applicable insights into the challenges of implementing NbS in deltaic environments globally

AB  - The European Commission promotes the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation since 1984. Horizon 2020 is open to everyone but the project coordinator should from EU countries. In 2016, a “Greening the Economy” call was announced. A proposal entitled “Regenarating ECOsystems with Nature-based solutions for hydro-meteorological risk rEduCTion (RECONECT)” was approved in November 2017 after one-year review processes. The National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) from Taiwan is one of the RECONECT 36 partners that from 18 countries. The Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan encourages and supports the Taiwanese research institutions to join the H2020 projects. This proposal is presented under this background. RECONECT aims to contribute to European reference framework on Nature Based Solutions (NBS) by demonstrating, referencing and upscaling large scale NBS and by stimulating a new culture for 'land use planning' that links the reduction of risks with local and regional development objectives in a sustainable way. To do that, RECONECT draws upon the network of carefully selected Demonstrators and Collaborators that cover a range of local conditions, geographic characteristics, governance structures and social/cultural settings to successfully upscale NBS throughout Europe and Internationally. NCKU plays as one of the International collaborators in RECONECT. Most of RECONECT partners focus on the application of NBS for inland problems such as flooding in the city or the landslide in the mountain. NCKU focuses on the application of NBS for coastal protection. Due to economy development request in the past 30 years, the coastal areas were heavy protected by hard constructions such as the grey sea dykes. It is less than 50% of the existing of nature coastline in Taiwan. Nowadays, people hope to enjoy the service of the sea but also hope they can be well protected when needed. NBS may be one of the approaches for Taiwan. This project proposes three strategies for NBS application in the coastal area. They are (1) remove (or partly remove) unnecessary artificial structures at the coastal area. (2) use nature material for coastal protection. (3) prepare room for the sea. Under the strategies, four research topics will be carried out in this project. They are (1) use of plants (such as Mangrove) to reduce ocean wave impact for the coastal area. (2) Reduce the height of sea dyke. (3) new coastal protection materials including oyster wave breaker and wooden groin. (4) Remove low-used fishing harbors to make more space for the sea. This study will develop models to assess the coastal protection capability and the eco-services, especially under the attacks of extreme weather conditions. This project works on coastal protection NBS and shares the experiences and outcomes with RECONECT partners. In the other hand, we learns from RECONECT partners to see NBS on inland problems application. It is necessary to attend the RECONECT meeting in Europe every 6 months. In addition, this project is going to arrange the 3 RECONECT Taiwan Workshops during the project periods to share with Taiwan local persons. This project will bring technical outcomes together with practical experiences.

AB  - The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) aims to improve the ability of coastal communities to reduce risks from sea level rise and coastal storms through the use of natural infrastructure and nature-based measures. Recognizing that better quantification of the storm risk reduction benefits of these approaches is necessary to help decision-makers choose among alternatives to protect their communities, as well as help to develop new market-based or private sector funding options for natural infrastructure and nature-based measures, this paper presents a review of the state of knowledge on the performance of these approaches, compiled from existing literature and participant input obtained during an EDF-convened expert workshop in May 2015. This EDF report represents the review of the state of knowledge on the performance of natural and nature-based infrastructure as compiled from existing literature and participant input obtained during an expert workshop. Table 1 provides an accessible summary of the most current state of understanding of the risk reduction performance of natural infrastructure. It is important to note that, while absent from the Table 1, non-structural approaches, such as zoning, building codes and evacuation planning, play critical roles in increasing coastal resilience. Sutton-Grier et al. (2015) highlight the strength and weaknesses of the coastal protection benefits provided by traditional built infrastructure, natural ecosystems, and combinations of built and natural infrastructure solutions. Improved resiliency to coastal storms requires careful consideration of this full suite of tools.

AB  - The effects of climate change on coastal communities along the United States Atlantic coast are becoming an increasing threat. The effectiveness and sustainability of traditional built protections that have been used to armor coasts against these threats has come into question as they require costly replacement and maintenance and are a contributor to significant disruptions in the functioning of the coastal ecosystems in which they are used. Nature-based solutions to protecting coastal communities are a cost-effective alternative to traditional coastal protections, and coastal ecosystems have been shown to be resilient to the effects of climate change and to storm hazards. These solutions include using the restoration of natural habitats alone, or in conjunction with built protections to enhance the ecosystem services provided to coastal communities, along with providing dynamic protections to coastal hazards. A tool in the suite of nature-based solutions for coastal resilience on the Atlantic coast is the restoration and creation of oyster reefs for their shoreline protection services. This case study summarizes how nature-based solutions can be an effective alternative to traditional coastal protections, the role of oyster restoration in nature-based solutions and examines how the current oyster restoration efforts in coastal South Carolina can be expanded on to develop nature-based solutions to the effects of climate change.

AB  - The ecosystem services afforded by coastal wetlands are threatened by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. The Kennedy Space Center and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida offer a representative site for investigating how changes to vegetation distribution interact with management to impact coastal protection. Here, salt marshes are converting to mangroves, and mosquito impoundment structures are being modified. The resulting changes to vegetation composition and topography influence coastal protection services in wetlands. We used a model-based assessment of wave attenuation and erosion to compare vegetation (mangrove, salt marsh) and impoundment state (intact, graded). Our findings suggest that the habitat needed to attenuate 90% of wave height is significantly larger for salt marshes than mangroves. Erosion prevention was significantly higher (470%) in scenarios with mangroves than in salt marshes. Intact berms attenuated waves over shorter distances, but did not significantly reduce erosion. Differences in coastal protection were driven more by vegetation than by impoundment state. Overall, our findings reveal that mangroves provide more coastal protection services, and therefore more coastal protection value, than salt marshes in east central Florida. Other coastal regions undergoing similar habitat conversion may also benefit from increased coastal protection in the future.

AB  - The economic pressures that have been placed on the Spanish coastline have resulted in coastal management strategies and policies that lack of consideration of the long-term costs and preservation of the natural environment. This has brought about the need to explore alternative solutions to the artificially constructed protection measures of the past. Restoration and better management of seagrass meadows along the Mediterranean coast has been proposed as a possible solution to the current problem. Sufficient evidence needs to be provided regarding their wave attenuation and erosion prevention capabilities before seagrass can be promoted as an effective coastal management strategy. This thesis presents a modeling study that aims to evaluate the wave attenuation aspect using a numerical modeling approach. The SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) wave model is first calibrated using a set of flume experiments and is then applied to a case study on the Catalan coast. The results indicate that the seagrass Posidonia oceanica does have an influence on hydrodynamics. Although no change in wave period was observed, it was concluded that the presence of the seagrass reduces the wave heights that end up reaching the shoreline. It is anticipated that this study is a starting point for a more comprehensive model at the Baix Camp location and other locations before seagrass meadows are promoted as an effective approach to coastal management.

AB  - The Dutch Government stimulates nature enhancement within offshore wind farms. Permit holders must take measures to increase the suitable habitat for species naturally occurring in the North Sea. European flat oysters are one of the focal species. In the ECOFRIEND project (2019-2023) we aim to monitor pilot oyster reefs, develop innovative monitoring methods, study abiotics and develop models, and provide advice. The main study site is Gemini offshore windfarm, located in the historical distribution area of the European flat oyster, 60 km off the Wadden Sea coast. The existing pilot oyster restoration in the windfarm serves to test different monitoring techniques. The focus is on deployment of light instruments (<20 kg) that can be deployed by hand from a small vessel, as an alternative to using large costly offshore vessels and heavy equipment, as is done in other offshore wind farms. We used 1x1x1 m oyster cages, each with 20 oysters inside for monitoring of growth and survival, tested a drop cam, a bait cam and used eDNA analysis for the surrounding fish biodiversity, and took water samples from the seafloor at 30 m depth with a large pump to detect oyster larvae (qPCR and microscopical counts). Norwegian oysters in cages deployed in April 2019 and retrieved in August showed 90 % survival, growth, and remained free of Bonamia. Furthermore, results of eDNA analysis corresponded largely with bait cam footage, with fish species such as plaice, gobies, horse marckerel, and sandeel (not visible on camera). In July 2019, larvae were found, which shows hat oysters were reproducing. Based on the 2019 experiences, we are improving oyster cages, and eDNA sampling techniques, and we will test additional promising monitoring techniques such as the valve monitor and ROV.

AB  - The detrimental ecological impacts of engineered shoreline protection methods (e.g., seawalls) and the need to protect the coastal zone have prompted calls for greater use of natural and nature-based infrastructure (NNBI). To balance competing needs of structural stability and ecological functioning, managers require assessments of NNBI designs and materials for differing environmental settings (e.g., among wave-energy regimes). To examine the effects of setting and oyster-based NNBI design on the provision of shoreline protection, we constructed reefs from two substrates: a novel, biodegradable material (Oyster Catcher, OC) and traditional oyster shell bags (SB) on low- and high-energy eroding salt marsh shorelines, designated based on fetch and boat wake exposure. Both reef types buffered marsh elevation change on the high-energy shoreline relative to unaltered controls, but only SB reefs were able to do so on the low-energy shoreline. Additionally, both shorelines experienced high ambient rates of retreat and declines in marsh vegetation shoot density. Although constructed reefs did not mitigate marsh retreat on the low-energy shoreline, novel OC reefs significantly reduced retreat relative to SB reefs and control sites (no reefs) on the high-energy shoreline. Those SB reefs were severely damaged by storm events, increasing their areal footprints at the expense of vertical relief. Conversely, OC reefs on both shorelines exhibited steady oyster recruitment and growth and hosted higher densities of larger oysters. To successfully provide shoreline stabilization benefits, oyster-based NNBI must be structurally stable and able to promote sustained oyster recruitment and growth. Our results indicate that deliberate decisions regarding NNBI substrate, siting, and configuration can produce resilient reefs, which reduce rates of erosion and, in some cases, enhance vertical accretion along salt marsh edges. The growth trajectory, structural stability, and co-benefit provisioning of OC reefs demonstrate the potential of alternative restoration substrates to provide valuable oyster habitat along threatened marsh shorelines.

AB  - The deleterious effects (biodeterioration) and the protective benefits (bioprotection) of biological colonisation on manmade structures have long been debated. Lichens, biofilms, algae, bivalves and gastropods contribute both directly and indirectly to damaging substrata in the coastal zone which can enhance abiotic erosive forces that exploit biologically induced superficial damage. There is mounting evidence that these same species may also provide protective benefits. This debate often impacts approaches to managing fouling on concrete assets in the coastal environment. The net benefit or detriment a species or assemblage has on a structure is spatially and temporally dynamic and subject to the influence of various abiotic and biotic factors at different scales. However, the net outcome may be more pronounced under different contexts, particularly under warming and ocean acidifying climate change scenarios which is where further research should focus. Additionally, as bioprotection represents a potentially valuable ecosystem service, it supports the argument for increasing and improving habitat availability and biodiversity on artificial coastal structures via ecological enhancement. Quantifying bioprotection in useful metrics, such as monetary value or time added to serviceable life, would help demonstrate the benefits of bioprotective species in a meaningful way.

AB  - The degradation of coastal habitats, particularly coral reefs, raises risks by exposing communities to flooding hazards. The protective services of these natural defenses are not assessed in the same rigorous, economic terms as artificial defenses such as seawalls, and therefore often not considered in decision-making. Here we present a new methodology that combines economic, ecological, and engineering tools to provide a rigorous financial valuation of the coastal protection benefits of coral reefs off Maui, Hawaii, USA. We follow risk-based valuation guidelines to quantitatively estimate the risk reduction benefits from coral reefs in terms of annual expected benefits in economic terms. Our ultimate goal is to identify how, where, and when coral reefs provide the most flood reduction benefits under current and future climates to inform reef conservation and management priorities.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has altered practically all human activities worldwide. Since the pandemic started at the beginning of 2020, infections have fluctuated drastically over time. It is difficult to predict how this situation will evolve in the coming months/years or when a return to some semblance of ’normal’ activity might occur. Because of global lock-up and distancing measures, the beaches, otherwise filled with tourists, first emptied and then had a reduced density of visitors owing to a wide variety of social-distancing measures. Therefore, new safety protocols need to include a wide range of aspects, such as epidemiological conditions, socioeconomic realities, and ecological contexts in which the pandemic occurs. Here, we propose new nature-based landscapes for sandy beaches to help maintain the social distancing of beach visitors while beaches and dunes are restored. When sufficient sediment is available, the maintenance and restoration of healthy beaches with incipient dunes and vegetation will help reduce contagion, promote human health, and recover natural ecosystems.

AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted the Strategic Plan (SP) for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in Nagoya, Japan in October 2010. The SP comprises five strategic goals and 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets; these targets were agreed for implementation by the CBD signatory countries. The Aichi Biodiversity Target 6 states that by 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably. Even though substantial progress has been made towards achieving this target, globally, a third of the marine fish stocks are overfished and many fisheries are causing unsustainable levels of bycatch of non-target species and are damaging marine habitats. The Global Biodiversity Outlook-5, 2020 (GBO-5) report says that the biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate and the pressures driving this decline are intensifying and none of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets is fully met. The present study has reviewed the implementation of the global Aichi Biodiversity Targets by India and other countries focusing on fisheries sector and has brought out good practices adopted by the countries in implementing these targets.

AB  - The concept of resilience has taken root in the discourse of environmental management, especially regarding Building with Nature strategies for embedding natural physical and ecological dynamics into engineered interventions in developed coastal zones. Resilience is seen as a desirable quality, and coastal management policy and practice are increasingly aimed at maximising it. Despite its ubiquity, resilience remains ambiguous and poorly defined in management contexts. What is coastal resilience? And what does it mean in settings where natural environmental dynamics have been supplanted by human-dominated systems? Here, we revisit the complexities of coastal resilience as a concept, a term, and a prospective goal for environmental management. We consider examples of resilience in natural and built coastal environments, and offer a revised, formal definition of coastal resilience with a holistic scope and emphasis on systemic functionality: “Coastal resilience is the capacity of the socioeconomic and natural systems in the coastal environment to cope with disturbances, induced by factors such as sea level rise, extreme events and human impacts, by adapting whilst maintaining their essential functions.” Against a backdrop of climate change impacts, achieving both socioeconomic and natural resilience in coastal environments in the long-term (>50 years) is very costly. Cost trade-offs among management aims and objectives mean that enhancement of socioeconomic resilience typically comes at the expense of natural resilience, and vice versa. We suggest that for practical purposes, optimising resilience might be a more realistic goal of coastal zone management.

AB  - The complex web of interactions between ecological communities and the physical landscape (biogeomorphology) is being affected by the global scale environmental changes of the Anthropocene. Climate change, habitat destruction, invasions and extinctions are having profound impacts on biogeomorphological process regimes through changes in the composition and activity of ecological communities. However, on the other hand, deliberately-targeted human interventions to biogeomorphic systems have the potential to help mitigate against, and adapt to, the Anthropocene, by managing biogeomorphic processes to enhance resilience. To evaluate these relationships, we propose a conceptual framework based on the ecological concept of functional traits. We review how the Anthropocene is causing changes in species composition, abundance and the prevalence of functional traits to produce changes to biogeomorphic processes and functions that are, as yet, only partly understood. We use examples of fluvial, dryland and coastal biogeomorphic systems to illustrate how purposeful manipulation of biogeomorphic systems (as a type of Nature-based solution) can conserve, enhance or add biogeomorphic functions that are capable of enhancing geomorphic resilience. By focussing on function, this approach offers a range of advantages/avenues for biogeomorphological research. This includes the detection and prediction of human impacts, and an improved understanding of how biogeomorphology can contribute to tackling environmental challenges in the Anthropocene.

AB  - The complex societal challenges facing policymakers today are deeply interlinked and require transformative, systems-level approaches to reduce risk and build resilience in the face of deep uncertainty about the future. Water security cannot be separated from climate change, natural hazards, food security, urbanization, poverty alleviation, and global pandemics. Each of these challenges has a water component, though none are solely water issues. Such challenges require resilient and effective responses that are sustainable for both communities and ecosystems. Responses must be flexible, robust, and based on a holistic management approach and cross-sectoral collaboration. Policy can play a key role in a strong enabling environment for these approaches, yet current international policy frameworks are not designed or implemented in ways that promote integrated planning across sectors, across policy frameworks, or across borders in regions with shared natural resources. This chapter provides an introduction to the major global policy frameworks and identifies potential areas for targeted, evidence-based NBS to contribute to the global goals and thereby enhance societal and ecological resilience.

AB  - The Colombian Seaflower marine protected area (SMPA) is the largest MPA in the Caribbean. The economy of the main island, San Andres (SAI) relies on tourism. This study conducted 1793 surveys to capture information about tourists’ experience and the value they placed on SAI’s beaches. Tourists considered beaches as the main reason for choosing SAI as a destination and expressed that they would be willing to pay additional money, US$ 997,468 annually, on top of what they had already paid for their vacation to protect SAI’s beaches. The study also showed how beach erosion could negatively impact economically the tourism sector of SAI, reducing revenue by 66.6% (estimated at US$ 73 million annually). This research contributed to the first stage in the development of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme to protect SAI’s beaches. The importance of beaches for SAI and the potential loss of revenue due to beach erosion create an opportunity to incentivize the private sector to invest in natural infrastructure that maintains and protects beaches. This study also informs the potential application of valuation studies for the development of innovative financing instruments, such as PES, to achieve financial sustainability for the MPA network in Colombia.

This Coastal Effects chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment updates those themes, with a focus on integrating the socioeconomic and environmental impacts and consequences of a changing climate. Specifically, the chapter builds on the threat of rising sea levels exacerbating tidal and storm surge flooding, the state of coastal ecosystems, and the treatment of social vulnerability by introducing the implications for social equity.

AB  - The coastal zone plays an essential part in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem and promoting the development of human society and economy. It is significant to assess the extent to which the Jiaozhou Bay coastal zone withstands floods and coastal erosion during storms. The coastal exposure index (CEI) of the Jiaozhou Bay in 1984, 2000 and 2019 was obtained by the coastal vulnerability model based on data including coastline, bathymetry and coastal terrain elevation. The spatial distribution and aggregation characteristics of CEI in Jiaozhou Bay were analyzed through spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results show that the north coast of Jiaozhou Bay is highly vulnerable, that is, prone to coastal erosion, while the south and east are less vulnerable, meaning that they can basically withstand natural disasters such as storm surges and floods. The CEI shows significant spatial autocorrelation, with little spatial heterogeneity. The type of coastline, elevation, distance to continental shelf and socio-economic development are the main factors that cause the north–south vulnerability differences in the Jiaozhou Bay coast. The results can identify the districts along the Jiaozhou Bay that are at greater risk of marine disasters, and provide scientific theoretical support for the coastal protection and sustainable development of the Jiaozhou Bay.

AB  - The coastal system can be regarded as co-evolving socio-economic and ecological systems undergoing intense environmental pressures owing to the mechanisms of change exerted by human activities against a background of natural change. Understanding and managing ecological responses to these changes in the coastal areas require interdisciplinary approaches. Here, we develop a new approach of coastal socio-ecological systems (CSES) based on earlier work on the press-pulse dynamics (PPD) socio-ecological systems. To show the relevance of the modified (mPPD) framework, we applied it to two unique features (mangroves and beach systems) of the western African coastal (WAC) systems. Then, we constructed plausible 21st-century coastal systems scenarios at the coast based on a set of descriptive indicators (population growth, economic development, environmental quality, governance, technological advancement and climate change) for a better understanding and sustainable management planning of WAC systems. We found that different indicators characterizing each scenario will exert different pressures on the WAC systems, under the forms of the long-term press and short-term pulse events. The cross-cutting narratives of the different future scenarios in the face of climate change using the mPPD framework offer valuable insight into the development of WAC management strategies, policies and other agendas. It helps to define the plausible implications of following, or not, a particular management path. The inconsistencies between the aspirations of different resource users and lack of coordination of human activities taking place on land and in the coastal zone, partly due to fragmentation of institutions and weak coastal governance are revealed. In this context, the mPPD-CSES framework can be used to investigate how ecosystems can experience different (intensities of) press as well as different frequencies of the pulse. Thus, its adaptability to construct future coastal vulnerability scenarios adds to its usefulness as a robust and dependable integrated coastal zone management tool.

AB  - The coastal risk assessment (CRA) has important implications for policy development, resilience enhancement, and risk reduction to reduce the magnitude and likelihood of future losses to coastal hazards. However, few if any existing in-practice CRA approaches account for the effects of coastal natural habitats (CNHs), which shield communities from natural hazards and support resilience enhancement in coastal regions. Here, we use a coupled human-nature system-based CRA framework to provide evidence on the influence of CNHs on coastal storm-risk levels and spatial distributions. We calculate a risk index for each coastal county along the U.S. Atlantic coast and employ different spatial assessment approaches to systematically analyse the risk. This index incorporates several bio-geo-physical variables (e.g., geomorphology, natural habitats, coastal relief, and historical data on sea level trends, wind, and wave) and data on socio-ecological systems. The index is calculated under two CNH scenarios (i.e., without- and with-habitat) and is further used for mapping the at-risk population. We find that the without-habitat scenario overestimates the population in the highest risk category by 10 % and the number of counties by as much as 40 % as compared to the with-habitat scenario—mostly in the Gulf region. Also, the without-habitat scenario miscalculates the spatial distribution of the risk (e.g., over/under-estimate the relative risk for Florida/New York). These findings highlight the role of CNHs to provide defensive services and the importance of incorporating CNHs into the risk assessment process. While the CNHs inclusive risk results are important for coastal risk-reduction through prioritization and smart resource allocation, the well evident influence of CNHs on risk level and its distribution is also supportive for conservationists to stress the policies relevant to the protection and restoration of coastal natural systems owing to their multiple services.

AB  - The coastal ecosystems are a key subject of contemporary research concerning coastline position changes, climate change effects, hazard assessment, and ecosystem services. The population density in the coastal areas accelerates the natural morphogenetic processes of these ecosystems. The land-use planning strategies can have a vital role in achieving coastal ecosystem stability and providing resilience to risks. This study's primary goal was to compare and evaluate different methodologies of mapping the protection area near the cliff crests designated by Coastal Protection Zones (CPZ). It was also proposed an alternative model (CPZ model). It was expected to contribute to the discussion of the best land use in these areas. The work was applied at a local scale in Lourinhã Municipality and at a national level (Portugal). The local scale results showed that the CPZ model would protect an area with a width between 96 and 327 m from the cliff crest. In contrast, the 2012 Portuguese legal framework application only covers a width between two and 9 m. The land-use planning of these zones must be carefully planned, and soil sealing must not be encouraged. In Portugal, the built-up areas stay between 1.2% and 14% of the different CPZ mapped.

AB  - The coast leaves few people untouched. Many of you will remember with nostalgia the family summer outings to the beach, or cherish the space and peace of a walk in the evening light. Proposals for construction, economic activities or other interventions in the coastal zone can invariably count on a serious debate between advocates and opponents. Dutch hydraulic engineers feel a tingling of pride when they bring new land above water in remote, exotic places - and thus, literally, expand the horizon of a country. However, this very sea has a much more grim face during a storm surge with waves crashing on its shores and the security of the country at stake1 . All of these aspects - protection against flooding, infrastructure, nature conservation, recreation, environmental planning - play a role in the field of coastal engineering. According to the Coastal Engineering Manual of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE, 2002), the history of coastal engineering begins in classical antiquity in the Mediterranean countries. The driving force behind this is the rise of shipping, around 3500 BC. Initially the engineering concerned the construction of berths, breakwaters and other harbour infrastructure. The port of Alexandria, built around 1800 BC with a capacity for 400 ships, was probably the most advanced of its time. In later times the Romans implemented numerous innovations in port design, including the construction of walls under water. A combination of increasing prosperity and excellent infrastructure gave rise to a new phenomenon: beach recreation. This led to an unprecedented growth of the seaside resort of Baiae in the Gulf of Naples With growing populations in coastal areas and the need for land for agriculture, flood protection became an increasingly important driver for the development of coastal engineering. Large floods, like the 1953 Watersnoodramp in the Netherlands (Fig. 1), but also the tsunami in South-East Asia and Hurricane Katrina in the United States, have permanently changed the coastline. They form the prelude to major investments in coastal protection schemes, giving an enormous boost to coastal research.

AB  - The climate of Sri Lanka has been fluctuating at an alarming rate during the recent past. These changes are reported to have pronounced impacts on the livelihoods of the people in the country. Water is central to the sustainable functioning of ecosystems and wellbeing of mankind. It is evident that pronounced variations in the climate will negatively impact the availability and the quality of water resources. The ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approach has proved to be an effective strategy to address the impact of climate change on water resources in many parts of the world. The key aim of this paper is to elaborate the wide range of benefits received through implementation of EbAs in field level, watershed scale, and urban and coastal environments in the context of Sri Lanka. In addition, this paper discusses the benefits of utilizing EbA solutions over grey infrastructure-based solutions to address the issues related to water management. The wide range of benefits received through implementation of EbAs can be broadly classified into three categories: water supply regulation, water quality regulation, and moderation of extreme events. This paper recommends the utilization of EbAs over grey infrastructure-based solutions in adaptation to climate change in the water management sector for the developing region due its cost effectiveness, ecofriendliness, and multiple benefits received on long-term scales. The findings of this study will unequivocally contribute to filling existing knowledge and research gaps in the context of EbAs to future climate change in Sri Lanka. The suggestions and opinions of this study can be taken into account by decision makers and water resources planning agencies for future planning of actions related to climate change adaptation in Sri Lanka.

AB  - The Catterline Bay in Scotland (UK) is regularly subjected to storm surges during spring tide periods which had led to coastal erosion and landslides. As a response to the local population whose material properties and lives are at risk, we have investigated the potential of design and construction of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) against the geo-hydro-climatic hazards posed by a changing climate. This paper assesses theoretically the wave attenuation capacity of an off-shore shellfish reef, as an NBS, which could be implemented in Catterline. Although less rigid than a traditional, ‘grey’ solution, this strategy plays on the depth reduction created by its organic structure to break the wave before it reaches the shore. Through numerical modelling using R Studio, we calculated the wave breaking probability (Qb) and the distribution of the wave energy flux (P) from the sea to the shore. Then, we compared two possible scenarios: the current conditions without a shellfish reef and a scenario with a constructed shellfish reef at three different locations and with different dimensions. The modelled NBS showed high wave breaking probability for each wave height trend. Moreover, the reef was shown to be more effective when located furthest from the shore. For maximum wave breaking effectiveness, the reef was shown to require relatively short length when located the furthest from the shore. Finally, based on the design and construction requirements, we offer recommendations about the reefs dimensions, and the shellfish species to implement as well as its management throughout the design life.

AB  - The Caribbean is affected by climate change due to an increase in the variability, frequency, and intensity of extreme weather events. When coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations, project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models, indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions. However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind, cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation.

AB  - The Building with Nature (BwN) approach developed by Ecoshape suggests that nature-based solutions can be sustainable and cost-effective alternatives for traditional engineering solutions. Widening the solution space by studying and understanding the physical and ecological system in the early stages of port planning and design is more likely to result in sustainable ports with opportunities for multi-functionality and respect for nature. This paper applies the BwN philosophy to a case study, i.e., the ongoing port development in Kuala Tanjung in Indonesia and examines the technical and financial feasibility of a nature-based concept, i.e., a mangrove breakwater instead of a traditional 'hard' breakwater. Mangroves can realize significant wave attenuation, and at the same time, they are productive eco-systems that can result in long-term benefits through multifunctional land use. A berm built of dredged material with a mild slope which 'grows' naturally by accretion behind permeable dams can create the right conditions for mangrove trees to grow. This mangrove protection can develop into a sustainable barrier which grows with the (relative) sea level rise by trapping sediments. A preliminary design was made on the basis of information available in literature. A rough cost comparison considering only the supply and placing of fill material showed that mangrove breakwater is about 25percent more expensive than a hard breakwater for the case under study. In view of the numerous port projects being planned in Indonesia, the technical and financial feasibility of mangrove breakwaters that can also enhance nature create added value for the surroundings is a promising finding.

AB  - The Ben Tre coasts have been extensively used for aquaculture and agriculture purposes for many decades resulting in widespread mangrove degradation and deforestation in the province. The loss of coastal mangroves contributed signiﬁcantly to severe coastal erosion in Binh Dai, Ba Tri and Thanh Phu in 2009 becoming more serious between 2012 and 2013. Severe coastal erosion has caused in the Ben Tre shoreline to be squeezed signiﬁcantly and mangroves to be lost. Since local agriculture is extremely vulnerable to coastal erosion, farmers have been losing crops and revenues. Between 2008 and 2013, there were a number of failed attempts to restore mangroves, despite there being technical guidelines in place and a favourable legal and policy environment. In July 2014, a survey was undertaken employing participatory action research methods to recommend options for sustainable coastal management and development at preselected sites in three coastal Districts of Ben Tre province (Ba Tri, Binh Dai and Thua Duc). This report presents the underlying causes of coastal erosion, evaluates the current policies and plans for coastal protection in Ben Tre Province, records local initiatives in coastal protection and recommends options for sustainable coastal management and development in Ba Tri, Binh Dai and Thua Duc Districts. While land tenure conﬂicts resulted in poor mangrove management and further mangrove degradation, poor pond construction and operation and inadequate farming techniques contributed greatly to mangrove loss and coastal erosion. The planting of a single species (Rhizophora apiculata) weakened the protection provided by coastal mangroves against erosion and increased the vulnerability to sea level rise and storm surge. Planting without proper protection, especially on eroding areas did not assist in establishing the mangrove belt in Ben Tre province. The current strategies employed by the Ben Tre province have had limited success mainly because these strategies only dealt with symptoms and had insuﬃcient local involvement in planning. While various local initiatives in coastal protection worked temporarily, many naturally vegetated coastal locations have been found to be eﬀective in minimizing the negative impacts of coastal erosion, sea level rise and storm surge.

AB  - The Bay of Santander, one of the most important and largest estuaries along the North coast of Spain (Gulf of Biscay), houses one of the most ancient ports in this coastal area, whose origin dates back to Roman times (Portus Victoriae). Since that time, the bay, the city and the port of Santander have evolved together over time, adapting the goods and services available to different uses and users. The bay has been traditionally used as a natural harbour that has integrated its fishing, commercial and recreational activities with important nature values of this estuarine area, including, among others, a European Special Area for Conservation (SAC) (EU Natura 2000 Network), traditional shellfish harvesting areas and a touristic hot spot in northern Spain (beaches, water sports, marinas, etc.). In this paper, a Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats analysis (SWOT) is carried out on the current and future perspectives of the socio-ecological space of the Bay of Santander, based on a review of current and past knowledge of its natural and socioeconomic systems.

AB  - The atmosphere concentration of CO2 is steadily increasing and causing climate change. To achieve the Paris 1.5 or 2 oC target, negative emissions technologies must be deployed in addition to reducing carbon emissions. The ocean is a large carbon sink but the potential of marine primary producers to contribute to carbon neutrality remains unclear. Here we review the alterations to carbon capture and sequestration of marine primary producers (including traditional ‘blue carbon’ plants, microalgae, and macroalgae) in the Anthropocene, and, for the first time, assess and compare the potential of various marine primary producers to carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation via biogeoengineering approaches. The contributions of marine primary producers to carbon sequestration have been decreasing in the Anthropocene due to the decrease in biomass driven by direct anthropogenic activities and climate change. The potential of blue carbon plants (mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses) is limited by the available areas for their revegetation. Microalgae appear to have a large potential due to their ubiquity but how to enhance their carbon sequestration efficiency is very complex and uncertain. On the other hand, macroalgae can play an essential role in mitigating climate change through extensive offshore cultivation due to higher carbon sequestration capacity and substantial available areas. This approach seems both technically and economically feasible due to the development of offshore aquaculture and a well-established market for macroalgal products. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides new insights and suggests promising directions for utilizing marine primary producers to achieve the Paris temperature target. We propose that macroalgae cultivation can play an essential role in attaining carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation, although its ecological impacts need to be assessed further.

AB  - The analysis of soil-vegetation interactions in erosion processes along coastlines requires accurate information about various factors influencing the upper soil layer. Yet, some of these parameters were previously determined by simplified, often hand held devices, and these were often biased by the skill and experience of the operator. This study thus investigates the erosion resistance of salt marsh soils influenced by grazing conditions for providing crucial findings for policy making and land management decisions; to that end, we present and use a novel shear resistance measuring device. This measuring device, called DiCoastar, was developed with a controllable step-motor and now allows us for the first time the determination of time histories of shear resistance by repeatable in-situ measurements, gaining information about the interaction between soil and root systems. A field study was conducted in salt marshes at Cäciliengroden and at Sönke-Nissen-Koog, both foreland salt marshes at the German North Sea coast. The two sites had been chosen due to their difference in grazing intensities, featuring semi-natural/ungrazed, moderately grazed and intensively grazed salt marshes. This was to enable the investigation of influences on soil shear strength and vegetation cover. Measurements of shear resistance were conducted with the DiCoastar in the chosen sites in the vicinity of the dike toes; it is found that the new device now provides consistent and repeatable measurements, irrespective of the operator, and only based on the pre-set control parameters. Results of the field study demonstrate that a marked increase of shear strength is only found in sites with high intensity grazing, but this is accompanied by a strong reduction in the vegetation cover and plant diversity, especially with regard to the vertical density distribution of the vegetation cover. As the reduction in vegetation cover leads to reduced wave attenuation over salt marshes and increased flow velocities, an increased shear stress on the soil surface, which potentially exceeds the increased shear strength, is expected. Based on this, the results obtained lead to the assumption that an increase in the erosion potential of these foreland marshes by high grazing pressure is more likely as well as a reduction in dike stability.

The policy will replace the Bank’s Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) policy of 2000.The Bank has defined a new vision for the water policy, aspiring to achieve a water secure Africa where there is equitable and sustainable use and management of water resources for quality socio-economic transformation.The vision is further elaborated on in the Bank’s goal to foster water availability and security throughout its regional member countries (RMCs) and to accelerate green and sustainable growth through its lending operations in the water sector.The subsequent objectives present concrete action points that the Bank intends to implement: To promote the attainment of a minimum platform of water security in RMCs and sub-regional groupings. The policy will concentrate on areas of fragility. [Note- it would be useful to clarify what AfDB means with ‘a minimum platform’.] Assist RMCs and sub-regional groupings in harnessing and sustaining the productive potential of their water resources in support of their national and regional development agendas. The policy is further guided by principles on water as a fundamental aspect of sustainable growth, the importance to ensure equitable growth in a social and economic context, promoting equitable access to serve the SDGs and the awareness of water as a transboundary issue across RMCs.

AB  - The adoption of Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) represents a novel means to mitigate natural hazards. In the framework of the OPERANDUM project, this study introduces a methodology to assess the efficiency of the NBSs and a series of Open-Air Laboratories (OALs) regarded as a proof-of-concept for the wider uptake of NBSs. The OALs are located in Finland, Greece, UK, Italy, and Ireland. The methodology is based on a wide modeling activity, incorporated in the context of future climate scenarios. Herein, we present a series of models’ chains able to estimate the efficiency of the NBSs. While the presented models are mainly well-established, their coupling represents a first fundamental step in the study of the long-term efficacy and impact of the NBSs. In the selected sites, NBSs are utilized to cope with distinct natural hazards: floods, droughts, landslides, salt intrusion, and nutrient and sediment loading. The study of the efficacy of NBSs to mitigate these hazards belongs to a series of works devoted to the implementation of NBSs for environmental purposes. Our findings prove that land management plays a crucial role in the process. Specifically, the selected NBSs include intensive forestry; the conversion of urban areas to grassland; dunes; marine seagrass; water retention ponds; live cribwalls; and high-density plantations of woody vegetation and deep-rooted herbaceous vegetation. The management of natural resources should eventually consider the effect of NBSs on urban and rural areas, as their employment is becoming widespread.

AB  - The accelerated rate of climate change questions the capacity of current infrastructures to adapt to altered future climate conditions, specifically in areas prone to floods, such as the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. Simultaneously the unforeseen effects of ‘hard’ engineering approaches (such as dams, storm surge barriers, defensive coastal management) have been affecting biophysical as well as ecological systems, resulting in increased vulnerability to floods and loss of estuarine habitats. Therefore there appears to be a need to rethink coastal (protection) strategies. The project relates to the temporal and spatial distributions of socio-economic as well as ecological vulnerabilities under the influence of increased flood probability and climatic stressors in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta, questioning how a nature-based approach can be used to support the adaptive capacity of the delta and mitigation of altered future climate conditions. It specifically explores the development of critical land-water zones adjacent to the Eastern Scheldt, and construction of a framework for decision making in which nature-based solutions are prioritized. Initial stressing factors as well as space availability indicate the preferred solution space both landwards and seawards over the consolidation of the existing line. As means to structure proposals an adaptive framework has been developed on the scale of Schouwen Duiveland to maintain the existing qualities of the island, as well as selecting and excluding a solution pathway based on the systemic functioning of the island. The approach stands closely to the the notion that humans are an intrinsic part of nature. Therefore developments related to water safety, fresh water supply and critical infrastructures should act in accordance to the acceptance of dynamics as apposed to the idea of presumed stability.

AB  - The ability of vegetated coastal ecosystems to sequester high rates of “blue” carbon over millennial time scales has attracted the interest of national and international policy makers as a tool for climate change mitigation. Whereas focus on blue carbon conservation has been mostly on threatened rural seascapes, there is scope to consider blue carbon dynamics along highly fragmented and developed urban coastlines. The tropical city state of Singapore is used as a case study of urban blue carbon knowledge generation, how blue carbon changes over time with urban development, and how such knowledge can be integrated into urban planning alongside municipal and national climate change obligations. A systematic review of blue carbon studies in Singapore was used to support a qualitative review of Singapore’s blue carbon ecosystems, carbon budget, changes through time and urban planning and policy. Habitat loss across all blue carbon ecosystems is coarsely estimated to have resulted in the release of ∼12.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since the beginning of the 20th century. However, Singapore’s remaining blue carbon ecosystems still store an estimated 568,971 – 577,227 tonnes of carbon (equivalent to 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide) nationally, with a small proportion of initial loss offset by habitat restoration. Carbon is now a key topic on the urban development and planning agenda, as well as nationally through Singapore’s contributions to the Paris Agreement. The experiences of Singapore show that coastal ecosystems and their blue carbon stocks can be successfully managed along an urban coastline, and can help inform blue carbon science and management along other rapidly urbanizing coastlines throughout the tropics.

AB  - The 2017 Atlantic storm season caused widespread damage to Caribbean nations including the British Virgin Islands. The winds and rainfall associated with Hurricanes Irma and Maria played their part in the destruction of infrastructure, livelihoods and the environment. With an increased interest in nature-based solutions to reduce flood risk, increasing the resilience of coastal communities and a focus on three of the most vulnerable communities in the Virgin Islands, we report on the use of flood risk vulnerability models based on remotely sensed satellite data and ecosystem services principles. Models were created with 4 primary aims to: (1) monitor the impact of storms and the recovery of mangroves, (2) assess the risk of flooding due to hurricane storm surges and extra-tropical storms (ground seas), (3) model opportunity areas for the restoration of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) and (4) model and produce maps highlighting the predicted benefits that mangrove restoration will have on vulnerable coastal communities. Results highlight that between 75 and 94% of red mangroves in the three communities were negatively impacted by hurricanes in 2017. However, vulnerability models predict that even small-scale mangrove restoration initiatives can help to reduce the flood risk of homes and infrastructure up to 475 m inland. This work has provided the rationale for mangrove restoration in the Virgin Islands and presents an important tool for expansion across the wider Caribbean region that can be used to inform coastal restoration and resiliency building activities.

AB  - The 2015 discovery of a native oyster reef in the Southern North Sea gave rise to and inspired numerous studies and pilots in this area. Efforts have been made on the description, protection and restoration of native oyster reefs in the Netherlands. Here we discuss the progress that has been made over the past five years in the Netherlands and Dutch North Sea in particular. We show the results of near-shore and off-shore restoration pilots and describe how evaluation of these results contributed to generating even more pilots. For the near-shore pilot, techniques that have been used over the past five years are evaluated in the context of future restoration efforts, including techniques for monitoring, substrate provisioning (including timing of deployment), active introduction and protection of native oysters. The off-shore pilots show multi-year survival and reproduction of native oysters and developments in biodiversity around the pilot. At the same time, knowledge gaps for long-term maintenance of the pilots and reefs are defined.

AB  - The “blue carbon” concept and the role of blue carbon stored in shallow coastal ecosystems in mitigating climate change have attracted attention worldwide. In addition to typical blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds and macroalgae farming are also gaining recognition as potential blue carbon sinks. Effective policies and methodologies are important for the conservation and expansion of blue carbon sinks, as well as the consequent reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). One of the most effective methods is carbon offset credit schemes. However, to date, almost all credit schemes have been implemented for mangroves and saltmarshes. None has been implemented for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming, although their CO2 uptake potentials are large. Here, we review three blue carbon offset credit projects for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming implemented in Japan. We show the blue carbon offset crediting projects of (1) Yokohama City, the first in the world; (2) Fukuoka City, the second such project in Japan; and (3) the first Japanese national governmental demonstration project. Furthermore, we highlight their characteristics by comparing them with the other blue carbon offset projects. Finally, we discuss the need to accelerate blue carbon offset credit projects and related initiatives in the future.

AB  - Sustainable management of environment and natural resources is essential for the long-term and sustainable growth of key economic sectors, such as fisheries, forestry or tourism, across the Caribbean. In addition to being important generators of GDP and beneficial to the human well-being overall, natural resources also provide a range of ecosystem services that play a critical role in the Caribbean countries’ efforts to reduce disaster risks and adapt to mounting climate change risks. The region is facing a number of challenges in this area, including the climate change impacts, limited access to financing, and narrow fiscal space, among others. Such challenges are being exacerbated by the unprecedented health, economic and social impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. However, with great challenges come great opportunities, including to grow and shift the development pathway into a green recovery, based on the richness of the natural resources and biodiversity that this region possesses.

AB  - Summary: This chapter provides an overview of several common tools and approaches used to assess risks from flooding and erosion, and to estimate coastal protection benefits from natural habitats. The methods for estimating the role and value of natural habitats in coastal protection and risk reduction are diverse but mainly fall into two broad categories of index-based approaches and process-resolving approaches (including numerical models) and vary considerably in their ease of use, complexity, and accuracy. This guidance note reviews both (i) the common coastal ecosystem service tools and (ii) the engineering tools, models and approaches for estimating coastal risks and the role of habitat (and other infrastructure) in reducing erosion and flooding to avert economic and social damages. It highlights how these approaches can address the role of coastal habitats in reducing erosion and flooding to avert economic and social damages. This guidance note recommends using process-based approaches in general and further recommends an Expected Damage Function (EDF) approach for valuing the coastal protection services from reefs and mangroves. The EDF is adapted from approaches commonly used in engineering and insurance to assess risks and benefits. There are five core steps to estimating coastal protection benefits from any kind of infrastructure: (i) estimate offshore hydrodynamics (wind, waves, and sea levels); (ii) Estimate nearshore hydrodynamics; (iii) Estimate effects of coastal structures (habitat) on hydrodynamics; (iv) Estimate flooding or erosion; and (v) Assess expected and averted damages (that is, value coastal protection benefits). Together, these five steps constitute a process of sequential steps that allow assessment of coastal habitat protection benefits in terms of damages averted by conserving or restoring the habitats. Engineers commonly use these steps to estimate coastal hazards and assess infrastructure alternatives for risk reduction (for example, dikes); the insurance industry also uses them to assess climate risks and adaptation alternatives.

AB  - SUMMARY: The purpose of this National Strategic Action Plan (NSAP) is to assist Mangroves for the Future (MFF) in identifying, designing, and planning activities in Vietnam in Phase III (2015–2018). The NSAP will provide strategic direction for this phase based on experience gained and lessons learnt during Phase II. The Vietnam MFF annual operational plan will be developed on the basis of this NSAP. During Phase II, the NSAP supported the MFF National Coordinating Body (NCB) to effectively operate and execute the MFF programme in Vietnam. This NSAP was reviewed and updated to take advantage of new opportunities for conservation, restoration and sustainable management of coastal ecosystems in Vietnam and throughout the region. In Vietnam, MFF will focus on coastal ecosystems, especially mangroves, which are seen as a priority for the important range of ecosystem services they provided to humans. MFF will operate at two geographic scales, working across the country, as well as implementing pilot sites at the local level. The NSAP does not recommend specific provinces, but presents criteria for consideration in identifying sites and prioritizing site-based activities. The first half of this document identifies key issues related to coastal resources management and coastal ecosystems in Vietnam; national policies, plans, and programmes (PPPs) and lessons learnt from Phase II, with special focus on current gaps. The second half briefly presents strategic entry points for MFF in Vietnam, starting with opportunities to mainstream MFF into national PPPs, followed by prioritization of activities for MFF Phase III. Cross cutting issues of climate change, gender, private sector engagement, fund raising and communications are also covered in detail in this NSAP. In terms of mainstreaming MFF into national PPPs, the NSAP recommends prioritizing programmes instead of policy initiatives because the former are associated with State budget allocations, and are therefore morelikely to be integrated into programmes of work.

AB  - Summary: Natural coastal ecosystems and the communities that depend on them are becoming more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Coastal cities such as the city-state of Singapore are becoming aware of this and have expanded their agenda for urban development to include climate resiliency. Naturebased solutions (NBS) are increasingly being implemented as they can mitigate and adapt to climate change while providing co-benefits for the environment, society, and economy. Attention on the potential of mangrove ecosystems to be used as an NBS for climate resiliency is on the rise, through mangrove conservation and rehabilitation. Using Singapore as a case study, this thesis aims to determine where mangrove rehabilitation projects and the agenda for urban development in Singapore converge. This is broken down into three research questions (RQs): the first RQ provides an understanding of how mangrove rehabilitation projects were conceptualised and governed, and the mangrove rehabilitation methods that were used; the second RQ identifies synergies and trade-offs that exist between mangrove ecosystem services and dimensions of urban development; and the third RQ brings out learnings that can be taken beyond the scope of mangrove rehabilitation projects, and considers how the expanded agenda for urban development enhanced learning.

AB  - Suaeda salsa, as the last biological barrier of coastal wetlands from land to sea, is one of the best nature-based restoration solution for shoreline stabilization and soil improvement in coastal wetlands. The quality of habitat determines the potential scope of wetland ecological restoration. To enlarge the Suaeda salsa area and to prevent the erosion and degradation of coastal wetland shorelines, we assessed the suitability of habitats for Suaeda salsa growth and identified the causes of encroachment into areas suitable for Suaeda salsa growth. Assessing the habitat suitability of the community and its disturbance status can not only effectively determine the suitable areas for Suaeda salsa ecological restoration, but also can propose targeted solutions according to the interference factors. Moreover, this way can greatly improve the survival rate and coverage area of Suaeda salsa restoration, reduce unnecessary input and loss, enhance the ability to resist coastal wetland shoreline erosion and degradation, and maintain the stability and integrity of the coastal wetland ecosystem. In this study, based on the data of 180 sampling points in the Liaohe estuary wetland, habitat suitability was identified, and the MaxEnt model (habitat suitability model) was used to analyze the suitable distribution area. The interannual changes in Suaeda salsa and reclamation activities in the Liaohe estuary wetland during the past 30 years were extracted from Landsat remote sensing images, and the temporal and spatial dynamic relationship between the distribution of Suaeda salsa and reclamation was analyzed. The dominant factors affecting the distribution of Suaeda salsa were water salinity as well as soil Cd and Zn levels, with influence weights of 49.1%, 28.9%, and 18.0%, respectively, and a total weight of 96%. Compared with the existing 596 hm2 of Suaeda salsa vegetation in the Liaohe estuary wetland, the area highly suitable for growth was 12,306 hm2, whereas the area with medium suitability was 12,100 hm2. Reclamation and aquaculture areas accounted for 33.31% of the highly suitable area and were the main reasons for habitat fragmentation. The study explained the reasons for the difficulty of ecological restoration of Suaeda salsa due to unsuitable habitat quality, and revealed a strong conflict between coastal reclamation and environmental protection, suggesting that the protection of coastal wetlands should consider changes in industrial model strategy. The restoration, reconstruction, and sustainable management of Suaeda salsa communities can be achieved by reducing the proportion of reclamation areas. This study improves the ecological restoration theory of degraded wetlands and provides a theoretical basis for coastal wetland protection and nature-based restoration programs.

AB  - Structures of Coastal Resilience presents new strategies for creative and collaborative approaches to coastal planning for climate change. In the face of sea level rise and an increased risk of flooding from storm surge, we must become less dependent on traditional approaches to flood control that have relied on levees, sea walls, and other forms of hard infrastructure. But what are alternative approaches for designers and planners facing the significant challenge of strengthening their communities to adapt to uncertain climate futures? Authors Catherine Seavitt Nordenson, Guy Nordenson, and Julia Chapman have been at the forefront of research on new approaches to effective coastal resilience planning for over a decade. In Structures of Coastal Resilience, they reimagine how coastal planning might better serve communities grappling with a future of uncertain environmental change. They encourage more creative design techniques at the beginning of the planning process, and offer examples of innovative work incorporating flexible natural systems into traditional infrastructure. They also draw lessons for coastal planning from approaches more commonly applied to fire and seismic engineering. This is essential, they argue, because storms, sea level rise, and other conditions of coastal change will incorporate higher degrees of uncertainty—which have traditionally been part of planning for wildfires and earthquakes, but not floods or storms. This book is for anyone grappling with the immense questions of how to prepare communities to flourish despite unprecedented climate impacts. It offers insights into new approaches to design, engineering, and planning, envisioning adaptive and resilient futures for coastal areas.

AB  - Stabilization of eroding estuarine shorelines using living shoreline techniques, including native vegetation and nearshore structural components, has the potential to combat erosion while increasing shoreline ecotone function. However, there are few detailed field studies and little quantitative data available to assess hydrodynamic changes that occur immediately following living shoreline implementation. To address this gap, detailed hydrodynamic observations were made along eroding and stable reference shorelines over a 16-month period spanning living shoreline stabilization, which included the landfall of a major hurricane (Irma) 9 weeks after stabilization. In the months following stabilization, planted vegetation was sparse and shoreline hydrodynamics were governed by water level relative to breakwater structures. When water levels were at or below breakwater crest elevation, current velocities were initially reduced by 62% and wave heights by up to 83%; however, at higher water levels, shoreline velocities at the stabilized site vastly exceeded those observed at a nearby bare control site. Sixteen months after stabilization, flow-vegetation interactions had become a dominant control over shoreline hydrodynamics, and current attenuation was similar to that observed in nearby mature mangrove vegetation. Additionally, turbulence dissipation rates at the stabilized site (2.2∙10−5 m2/s3) and vegetated reference site (1.1∙10−5 m2/s3) were an order of magnitude greater during boat wake events compared to the bare shoreline site (1.6∙10−6 m2/s3,p < 0.001). This first experimental assessment of hydrodynamic effects related to living shoreline stabilization indicates that more than one year may be required before planted vegetation meaningfully influences shoreline hydrodynamics.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora, an invasive plant, was introduced to the Chinese coastal zone in the early 90s. As an eco-engineering species, S. alterniflora not only alters saltmarsh species distributions, previously described as habitat degradation, but it also plays a vital role in coastal protection, especially for the development of recently emerged intertidal shoals. To provide a reference for coastal management under global change, we quantified the impact of the invasion process on provided ecological and coastal protection functions, exemplified at the emerging Jiuduansha Shoals (JDS) in the Yangtze Estuary. Results obtained by high-precision satellite monitoring and numerical modelling showed that the establishment and growth of S. alterniflora can exert considerable changes on local environment. The invasion of S. alterniflora to JDS wetland can be divided into three distinct phases, (1) establishment 1998–2003, (2) expansion 2003–2009, and (3) dominant 2009–2018 stages according to the changes in saltmarsh composition. Spatially, S. alterniflora continuously replaced Scirpus mariqueter, forcing S. mariqueter and Phragmites australis slowly to the lower and higher intertidal habitats, respectively. Notably, S. alterniflora expansion was the main driver that contributed to over 70 % of recent JDS wetland expansion even under sediment deficit conditions. Established S. alterniflora marsh (directly) dampens more waves because of aboveground stems, but it also causes more accretion and indirectly leads to higher “morphological” wave dampening. Thus, it increases coastal defense provided by the saltmarsh in the context of sea-level rise and strengthening storms. In conclusion, the role of S. alterniflora invasion to the local environment under global changes is controversial. For sustainable coastal management, we need context-dependent S. alterniflora management to maximize the benefit of coastal protection and minimize the impact on local ecology, especially in sediment-starving estuaries with expected coastline retreat.

AB  - Soil erosion, sediment loss, and catchment degradation are typical of the combined effects of sea level rise and climate change at the coastline and further inland. We describe an integrated, multidisciplinary, naturebased solutions (NbS) approach to resolving some of the most pressing issues facing coastal communities affected by hydrological impacts due to increasing water levels and saline intrusion. Our solutions are developed for African coasts and are equally applicable and scalable to coastlines and hydrological systems around the world where sediment starvation, changing rainfall patterns, and saline intrusion of the coastal aquifer are causing major changes to natural ecosystems, human habitats, and agriculture. We use a systems approach that combines modeling and data collection to examine the complete system from upstream fluvial inputs into dams (reservoirs), to downstream coastal wetlands, the littoral system, and the coastal aquifer. We emphasize the requirement to understand the interactions between existing natural and artificial assets as a precursor to recommending any management changes to the natural or anthropogenic infrastructure systems in place. A combination of NbS and novel management techniques are proposed to restore natural sediment and freshwater supplies to coastal communities. Our green infrastructure types have been extensively tested and have the potential to significantly reduce erosion; one of them has the added benefit of simultaneously providing desalinated water (and electricity) to adjacent coastal communities. Our sediment bypass technique for dams has been shown to restore natural sediment supplies downstream of reservoirs, and our sediment mapping tool has been used successfully to identify sediments for use in coastal restoration and nourishment schemes. We hypothesize that it is possible to reduce the extent of land degradation caused by saline intrusion through better management of water abstraction in the coastal aquifer. We expect our approach to deliver significant environmental and socio-economic co-benefits to coastal and inland communities and ecosystems, many of which are already suffering from the effects of land degradation and a lack of investment. Solutions are scalable and standalone, however when combined, their synergy greatly increases benefits on a regional scale.

AB  - Small islands are adapting to inundation from storm surge and sea level rise by largely choosing strategies that include shoreline hardening which can handicap and exclude natural communities. Incorporating nature based solutions to mitigate inundation impacts on human communities is termed Ecosystem Based Adaptation. The Nature Conservancy is working to reduce vulnerabilities from inundation by changing perceptions about shoreline hardening that include nature based solutions. With help from the National Parks, Rivers and Beaches Authority of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, we are demonstrating how this can be done with tropical island habitats. Raising awareness and supporting decisions to reduce vulnerability has been facilitated by the use of three geographic based decision support tools; open source GIS software training of government employees and community leaders, participatory 3D mapping and interactive web mapping. The result of this work has impacted perceptions by providing creative ways to visualize inundation scenarios.

AB  - Small Island Developing States are considered as one of most severely affected by climate change and sea-level rise. Some atoll nations would virtually disappear with a sea-level rise of one metre. The objective is to derive a first-cut classification of coastal protection technology for the Small Island Developing States to address sea-level rise. First, an assessment is made of the existing and future adaptation measures to sea-level rise in the latest 35 English-language National Communications submitted by the Small Island Developing States to the UNFCCC. Next, a wide variety of adaptation measures is culled from key coastal engineering manuals and other sources with a focus on more innovative tools and ideas beyond the traditional hard and soft measures. This yielded several possible adaptation tools that could be used by the Small Island Developing States, and with further research, more tools could be applied. In conclusion, a first-cut classification of coastal protection technology is proposed for the Small Island Developing States to address sea-level rise. The resulting table shows eight categories graded from the usual hard and soft measures to new and innovative ideas.

AB  - Since the Brouwersdam was built as part of the Delta plan, the Grevelingen outer delta undergoes large-scale morphological changes. These changes led to the formation of a shoal adjacent to the dam, which is referred to as the Brouwersdam beach. The beach has been eroding and shifting towards the northeast ever since. The beach has no safety function, as the hinterland is protected from flooding by the Brouwersdam. However, the beach has a large recreational value, which will decrease if no human interventions are taken. Consequently, many stakeholders demand the preservation of the beach. For the Municipality of Schouwen-Duiveland, the loss of recreational value of the beach is estimated to decrease the yearly financial benefits by 0.8 to 5.4 million euro. Hence, their interest in the preservation of the beach is large and therefore they have commissioned this study. This study aims to design nature-based solutions for the ongoing erosion and coastline shift to which the Brouwersdam beach is subjected. The design approach of this research is based on the Building with Nature (BwN) design steps. A thorough analysis of the physical, ecological and social system is followed by the set-up of a Program of Requirements (PoR) for the design. Insight in the physical system is partly obtained by a modelling study in Delft3D-WAVE and UNIBEST-CL+. Based on the PoR, designs are identified, evaluated and selected iteratively. The design iterations, based on the systems’ insights and the PoR, led to the creation of three Nature-based Solutions. The alternative solutions include the creation of a shellfish habitat by making structures of layered brushwood fascine mattresses filled with shells or other hard substratum. The shellfish reef, in which mainly Japanese oysters are expected to settle, provides many ecosystem services such as enhancing biodiversity. Moreover, the structures can be constructed CO2-neutral. The different configurations of the solutions, ensuring coastal protection, are: A groyne configuration, creating multiple pocket beaches, of 1 straight groyne and 4 L-shaped groynes with an orientation slightly tilted towards the west, i.e., the dominant wave direction (Solution A) ; A straight groyne with a west-east orientation, combined with a sediment beach fill between the current coastline and the groyne (Solution C) ; A fishtail groyne, which is a structure with a slightly curved, shore-normal groyne arm and a shore-parallel breakwater arm (Solution E). These solutions were compared with frequent nourishing (solution F) and to the reference situation, i.e. taking no action. The assessment of the solutions by means of a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), based on the categories functionality, costs, recreational value (water and beach recreation separately), ecological value and aesthetics, led to the conclusion that the designs are equally feasible but score differently on the categories. The results of the MCA thus illustrate that the conclusion on the most feasible solution depends on priority. The study concludes that preserving the Brouwersdam beach in a nature-based way is feasible. The MCA tool can potentially support future decision-making processes following this study by clarifying the trade-offs between the different designed solutions. Further exploring the economic benefits of recreational functions will contribute to validating the weight factors in these categories. The results of this study contribute to the discussion on the preservation of the Brouwersdam beach and to the strive for knowledge on ecosystem-based projects within the field of hydraulic engineering.

AB  - Since Japan is surrounded by the sea and has steep land extending from north to south, the population has concentrated on narrow coastal plains. While the coastal area has played an important role as a place of living and trade in Japan, the risk of damage from high tides, sea breeze and sand drifting became remarkable issues, due to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, caused by climate change. To protect the inland developed areas, seawalls and forests have been constructed on coastal sand dunes along the coastlines in Japan. However, these coastal protection structures have resulted in the loss of resilience by dune ecosystems, which are an integrant part of sandy beaches. Furthermore, it is predicted that it will be difficult to provide a budget for their maintenance costs in the future, due to the actual trend for the Japanese population to decrease. It is considered that using coastal sand dunes as green infrastructures will be important for future goals regarding safe and sustainable land-use management, ecosystem conservation and human well-being.

AB  - Significance The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on September 25 released a new special report highlighting the risks to marine and human life from global warming symptoms such as sea-level rise, ocean acidification and marine heatwaves. The report’s release coincided with news that this year’s Arctic sea-ice minimum was the joint-second lowest on record. Last month’s UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit saw 70 countries indicate their intention to submit revised Paris Agreement pledges next year. However, the largest emitters made only vague announcements. Impacts Reduced sea ice in the Arctic will enable greater economic activities such as fishing, shipping and tourism. Considerable technical hurdles remain to developing robust ‘blue carbon’ accounting which may hinder advancement. Economic feasibility, social acceptance and environmental trade-offs, more than technology, will present barriers to coastal protection.

AB  - Significance StatemeThis chapter puts into conversation two distinct yet interrelated planning visions – <jats:italic>Blue Urbanism</jats:italic> as a movement in its own right. driven by the overarching promise of more meaningfully reconnecting coastal cities with their marine ecosystems, and <jats:italic>Nature-based solutions</jats:italic>, with roots in engineering that encompass a broad range of conservationist and infrastructural interventions rooted in Euro-American sensibilities around (urban) nature. Drawing on urban Southeast Asia for inspiration, namely Jakarta, Metro Manila and Singapore, the chapter unpicks dominant understandings of “nature” within its concomitant planning paradigms. Particular attention is placed on divergent meanings and contradictions that underpin how urban coastal nature(s) are materially imagined, reproduced and contested through often technical means, utilitarian value-systems, and modes of governing adaptation in its broadest sense.</jats:p>

AB  - Shorelines and their ecosystems are endangered by sea-level rise. Nature-based coastal protection is becoming a global strategy to enhance coastal resilience through the cost-effective creation, restoration and sustainable use of coastal wetlands. However, the resilience to sea-level rise of coastal wetlands created under Nature-based Solution has been assessed largely on a regional scale. Here we assess, using a meta-analysis, the difference in accretion, elevation, and sediment deposition rates between natural and restored coastal wetlands across the world. Our results show that restored coastal wetlands can trap more sediment and that the effectiveness of these restoration projects is primarily driven by sediment availability, not by wetland elevation, tidal range, local rates of sea-level rise, and significant wave height. Our results suggest that Nature-based Solutions can mitigate coastal wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise, but are effective only in coastal locations where abundant sediment supply is available.

AB  - Shoreline erosion, flood surges, river sediments, and water pollution are only a few of the common threats to many coastal areas, with extreme climate-related events exacerbating the intensity and urgency of the resulting negative impacts. In addition, some coastal areas are excessively mined for sand, protective mangroves are destroyed, and coastal waters are overfished, affecting the well-being, safety, and livelihoods of local communities. These threats disproportionally affect the poorest and most marginalized groups, including women and children, leading to their increased vulnerability to climate change and adoption of negative coping mechanisms.

AB  - Shoreline erosion and storm tide inundation increasingly threaten coastal populations, infrastructure and economies. Hard infrastructure, known as gray infrastructure (e.g. concrete seawalls), has commonly been used to protect coastal communities but is expensive to build, maintain, and deteriorates coastal vegetation. Green infrastructure (e.g. restored or conserved mangrove and marsh ecosystems) delivers nature-based coastal protection but in comparatively lower density coastal areas. Nowadays a more popularized approach to coastal protection is hybrid eco-engineering. In this study, we discuss lessons-learnt on how the hybridization of engineered structures and wetland restoration practices compared with traditional gray and green approaches. We contrast hybrid applications in mangrove and tidal marsh areas in the UK and south-east Asia. The majority (70%) of successful hybrid infrastructure cases were underpinned by understanding of ecological and hydrological changes in response to infrastructure and involved a wide range of stakeholders. In terms of construction and maintenance cost, limited data suggested that hybrid infrastructure may be more cost effective than gray infrastructure, but more expensive than green; however, data were very limited and therefore we suggest the need for further cost-benefit analyses to inform a robust comparison. Development of new technologies should see growing efficacy of future hybrid infrastructure in mitigating coastal flood risks.

AB  - Shellfish farming is considered a highly sustainable form of aquaculture that has developed rapidly worldwide. Unfortunately, today biological and chemical pollution of the oceans and marine waters is widespread and has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, which are exacerbated by global climate changes. In addition, such impacts on fisheries and aquaculture are significant in inducing socio-economic losses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop innovative solutions to improve productivity and environmental performance in line with the blue sustainable economy (European Green Deal). However, one upcoming problem associated with shellfish consumption is shell waste and its disposal. In addition, the percentage of wasted shells destined for reuse is much lower than the one accumulated in landfills or in more or less well-managed sites. This represents a weakness of the shellfish farming sector that can only be mitigated through a project of shellfish waste recycling moving towards the circular economy, with undoubted environmental and economic advantages. In the present study, we present a possible solution for recycling clam shells coming from the waste of the fishing industry (circular economy). Indeed, three eco-friendly bio-reefs for the stabilization and implementation of marine biodiversity (blue economy) were realized using additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) for large dimensions (technological innovation). Furthermore, before deploying the reefs on the sea bottom, they were colonized with oysters to promote repopulation.

AB  - Several fishing communities across the Caribbean are experiencing rapid changes in the coastal ecosystem services that underpin their livelihood security. In Jamaica, these changes are partly reflected in the collapse of the local capture fishery, which has exacerbated ecological, social and food security challenges. In this paper, coastal and community-based vulnerability approaches are combined to assess the climate change vulnerability of three major fishing communities (Old Harbour Bay, Rocky Point, and Alligator Pond) along the southern coast of Jamaica. These communities are at the frontline of some of the most serious threats from climate change and have been badly affected by rapid changes in coastal and marine ecosystems. The impacts of coastal erosion on fishing businesses, as well as the vulnerability of fishing infrastructure and assets to coastal flooding are examined in the three sites. Coastal flooding and erosion directly impact household and personal property, fishery business assets, public infrastructure, and disrupt opportunities to reduce intergenerational poverty in the targeted communities. The paper concludes by highlighting four key strategies for reducing livelihood vulnerabilities to coastal erosion and flooding. These include creating economic alternatives, improving ecosystem resilience, strengthening co-management approaches, and developing gender-sensitive indicators to assess vulnerability in fishing communities. The results demonstrate the value of integrative social and coastal vulnerability assessments in characterizing nuanced climate impacts on fishery-related businesses.

AB  - Seas and oceans are complex ecosystems that support life on earth (climate regulation) and provide essential services to human societies. However, direct or indirect multiple anthropogenic pressures may impact the coastal areas and make the marine ecosystems vulnerable. The health of the seas and oceans has therefore become a crucial issue. The United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) aims to promote partnerships between all stakeholders, education and public awareness with the ultimate goal of removing the barriers to protecting the oceans and seas. The ECOSEAS (Ecology and Conservation Science for Sustainable Seas) laboratory of Université Côte d'Azur has been involved for many years in programmes to protect and restore marine ecosystems, as well as programmes to monitor the impact of pollution (chemical, noise or harmful algae blooms), invasive species, the destruction of habitats and overexploitation of resources. Faced with the extent of the environmental disturbances observed, the time for action is now more than ever! We need to spread scientific knowledge, share research innovations and propose mitigation and adaptation solutions, in particular nature-based solutions. It is also urgent to raise awareness among citizens, especially school-age children, of the major challenges of protecting marine ecosystems.

AB  - Seaports are exposed to a variety of coastal risks, particularly when considering the effects of climate change, due to their location in the land–sea interface. The vulnerability of seaports, besides the robustness and design of their infrastructures, is also directly related to their adaptive capacity. A policy framework plays an important role in facing the effects of climate change by virtue of planning and supporting the implementation of adaptive measures. This research aims to identify and evaluate the extent to which the climate change topic is addressed by the port planning, coastal management, and climate adaptation policies of Brazil. A policy review was carried out and the documents were evaluated based on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action) targets. A multiscale analysis was performed to identify how different management levels address the topic in their planning. The results suggest that although Brazil has effectively addressed the climate issue with its Adaptation National Plan, the coastal management framework and primarily port planning both remain uncertain. The existing coastal policies for climate adaptation purposes remain virtually not implemented, and accomplishments related to port adaptations are based only on a recent national sustainability guideline agenda. Although climate change impacts are perceived on a local scale, the Brazilian coastal ports and cities have not institutionalized efforts to taking climate-adaptive actions. This observed gap points out the necessity of policymakers to enhance the planning and application of adaptation measures at the local level, as well as promote the cooperation between multiscale sectoral agencies. This overview illustrates several opportunities to update, redesign, and innovate coastal and port management instruments to address climate-related issues. Nature-based Solutions would appear as a fundamental approach to be incorporated in multi-scale policy frameworks, which would support coastal ports and cities in their becoming climate-resilient, thus containing socio-economic losses and environmental deterioration.

AB  - Seagrasses, a polyphyletic group of about 60 marine angiosperm species, are the foundation of diverse and functionally important marine habitats along sheltered sedimentary coasts. As a novel ecological function with high societal relevance, a role of the seagrass leaf canopy for reducing potentially harmful bacteria has recently been hypothesized in tropical regions, but data for temperate regions are lacking. Here, we tested whether or not the abundance of general bacteria and more specifically, those belonging to the genus Vibrio were reduced within temperate Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadows compared to adjacent sand flats and sampled 5 sites in the south-western Baltic Sea using SCUBA. Compared to non-vegetated area, we found an average reduction of 39% for all Vibrio and 63% for the potentially harmful V. vulnificus/cholerae subtype based on robust plate counting data on Vibrio selective agar. The underlying mechanism of the reduction in bacterial load is currently elusive and clearly merits further study. Our results underline the critical importance of seagrasses in maintaining shallow water ecosystem functioning including water quality and provide further motivation for their protection and restoration.

AB  - Seagrasses provide a wide range of services including food provision, water purification and coastal protection. Pacific small island developing states (PSIDS) have limited natural resources, challenging economies and a need for marine science research. Seagrasses occur in eleven PSIDS and nations are likely to benefit in different ways depending on habitat health, habitat cover and location, and species presence. Globally seagrass habitats are declining as a result of anthropogenic impacts including climate change and in PSIDS pressure on already stressed coastal ecosystems, will likely threaten seagrass survival particularly close to expanding urban settlements. Improved coastal and urban planning at local, national and regional scales is needed to reduce human impacts on vulnerable coastal areas. Research is required to generate knowledge-based solutions to support effective coastal management and protection of the existing seagrass habitats, including strenghened documentation the socio-economic and environmental services they provide. For PSIDS, protection of seagrass service benefits requires six priority actions: seagrass habitat mapping, regulation of coastal and upstream development, identification of specific threats at vulnerable locations, a critique of cost-effective restoration options, research devoted to seagrass studies and more explicit policy development.

AB  - Seagrasses offer diverse ecosystem services, yet, they are among the most threatened ecosystems. When degraded or destroyed, their services are lost or reduced in the process, affecting, for instance, local communities directly dependent on their livelihood provision. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that climate change is projected to worsen over time; thus, there is an urgent need for mitigation strategies in practice and also in the longer term. This work aims to provide an alternative perspective of seagrass restoration as a nature based solution (NbS) on a global scale, yet, giving an emphasis on tropical regions such as Indonesia. We focused on seagrass restorations which are not yet well established in comparison with other restoration programs (e.g., mangroves) despite their critical roles. We present in this work how restoring seagrass meadows fits the global standard of NbS published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The results of this study can serve as a basis for promoting seagrass restorations as NbS against climate change particularly in countries with a wide extent of seagrass coverage.

AB  - Seagrasses have the ability to contribute towards climate change mitigation, through large organic carbon (Corg) sinks within their ecosystems. Although the importance of blue carbon within these ecosystems has been addressed in some countries of Southeast Asia, the regional and national inventories with the application of nature-based solutions are lacking. In this study, we aim to estimate national coastal blue carbon stocks in the seagrass ecosystems in the countries of Southeast Asia including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. This study further assesses the potential of conservation and restoration practices and highlights the seagrass meadows as nature-based solution for climate change mitigation. The average value of the total carbon storage within seagrass meadows of this region is 121.95 ± 76.11 Mg ha−1 (average ± SD) and the total Corg stock of the seagrass meadows of this region was 429.11 ± 111.88 Tg, with the highest Corg stock in the Philippines (78%). The seagrass meadows of this region have the capacity to accumulate 5.85–6.80 Tg C year−1, which accounts for $214.6–249.4 million USD. Under the current rate of decline of 2.82%, the seagrass meadows are emitting 1.65–2.08 Tg of CO2 year−1 and the economic value of these losses accounts for $21.42–24.96 million USD. The potential of the seagrass meadows to the offset current CO2 emissions varies across the region, with the highest contribution to offset is in the seagrass meadows of the Philippines (11.71%). Current national policies and commitments of nationally determined contributions do not include blue carbon ecosystems as climate mitigation measures, even though these ecosystems can contribute up to 7.03% of the countries' reduction goal of CO2 emissions by 2030. The results of this study highlight and promote the potential of the southeast Asian seagrass meadows to national and international agencies as a practical scheme for nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation.

They form extensive meadows found globally that bioengineer their local environments and preserve the coastal seascape. With the increasing realization of the planetary emergency that we face, there is growing interest in using seagrasses as a nature-based solution for greenhouse gas mitigation. However, seagrass sensitivity to stressors is acute, and in many places, the risk of loss and degradation persists. If the ecological state of seagrasses remains compromised, then their ability to contribute to nature-based solutions for the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis remains in doubt. We examine the major ecological role that seagrasses play and how rethinking their conservation is critical to understanding their part in fighting our planetary emergency.

AB  - Seagrasses are essential marine ecosystems for which restoration has proven challenging due to increased hydrodynamic stress. This study aims to analyze the flow alteration induced by an artificial seagrass (ASG) meadow by characterizing its wake effect through a shelter distance and thus yield guidance for seagrass restoration projects. Here, we define shelter distance as the longitudinal extent behind a meadow, with respect to the flow direction, where seagrass is protected and can hence grow successfully. Flume experiments were conducted for submerged meadows with three different lengths at constant canopy height, shoot density and water depth, and three different cross-section-averaged longitudinal flow velocities measured with state-of-the-art Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). For the tested meadow morphology and hydrodynamic conditions, meadow length played a less important role regarding shelter distance, while incident flow velocity and effective canopy height governed the wake effect. Incident velocities <30 cm s−1 prompted shelter distances >2 m behind the meadow, whereas higher velocities led to a reduced shelter distance ranging from 20-40 cm. ASG additionally produced an upwelling effect on the vertical distribution of the velocity profile observed along the wake, regardless of meadow length and incident velocity. Our results suggest that restoration projects should aim for areas of low flow, where currents induced by tidal or wind waves are less pronounced in order to activate larger shelter distances.

AB  - Seagrass meadows support complex species assemblages and provide ecosystem services with a multitude of socio-economic benefits. However, they are sensitive to anthropogenic pressures such as coastal development, agricultural run-off, and overfishing. The increasing prevalence of marine heatwaves (MHWs) due to climate change poses an additional and growing threat. In this study, we apply the environmental sensitivity mapping approach MESA (Mapping Environmentally Sensitive Assets) to explore the potential consequences of MHWs on the ecosystem services that Posidonia oceanica provides to coastal communities. Under the intermediate climate change scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, Mediterranean marine heatwaves will be severe by 2050, and will very likely increase mortality of P. oceanica. However, the societal risk of seagrass loss is not evenly distributed across the Mediterranean. The spatial distribution of socio-economic implications of seagrass loss is highlighted through two case studies on seagrass-dependent fisheries and coastal hazards. Coastal communities in Tunisia and Libya show very high sensitivity to a loss of fisheries due to a combination of increasingly intense and frequent MHWs, coupled with high proportions of regional seagrass-dependent fisheries catch. The coastlines of Italy, Tunisia, and Cyprus are shown to potentially be highly sensitive to loss of seagrass due to high levels of coastal hazards, and seagrass meadows susceptible to MHW-induced degradation. These coastlines are likely to suffer from reduced coastal protection services provided by intact seagrass meadows. We demonstrate the implications of MHWs for ecosystem service provision to coastal communities in the Mediterranean and the need for policy instruments to help mitigate and adapt to its effect. We also highlight the potential for environmental sensitivity mapping to help support policymakers with rapid screening tools to prioritize resources more effectively to areas where in-depth local planning is needed.

AB  - Seagrass meadows deliver multiple ecosystem services that are of particular importance to resource-poor coastal communities, yet they are rapidly declining globally. The Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) approach has been used to fund the protection of other ‘Blue Carbon’ Ecosystems (BCE), yet seagrass has been incorporated in just one PES project worldwide. Some of the ecosystem services delivered by seagrass have the potential for inclusion under a PES framework but multiple challenges currently make this difficult, particularly under community-based management. PES programmes typically focus on carbon as the tradable service, but scientific uncertainties regarding seagrass carbon are likely to remain significant barriers to using carbon as the sole commodity under current carbon trading standards and market conditions. It is recommended here that project developers demonstrate the multiple ecosystem services delivered by seagrass meadows, along with their importance to coastal communities, in the planning and marketing of seagrass PES projects. Moreover, they should consider approaches that incorporate seagrass meadows into other blue carbon certified projects. The capacities of the communities that rely most heavily on seagrass are generally very limited. Consequently, demanding high levels of scientific certainty over carbon stocks and flows will exclude most of these communities. Standards, buyers and policy makers should consider building community capacity in the technical and marketing requirements of voluntary carbon standards. The voluntary carbon market has the flexibility to pioneer certified seagrass carbon, potentially leading to the inclusion of seagrass carbon in formal policy instruments, such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

AB  - Seagrass meadows are natural carbon storage hotspots at risk from global change threats, and their loss can result in the remineralization of soil carbon stocks and CO2 emissions fueling climate change. Here we used expert elicitation and empirical evidence to assess the risk of CO2 emissions from seagrass soils caused by multiple human-induced, biological and climate change threats. Judgments from 41 experts were synthesized into a seagrass CO2 emission risk score based on vulnerability factors (i.e., spatial scale, frequency, magnitude, resistance and recovery) to seagrass soil organic carbon stocks. Experts perceived that climate change threats (e.g., gradual ocean warming and increased storminess) have the highest risk for CO2 emissions at global spatial scales, while direct threats (i.e., dredging and building of a marina or jetty) have the largest CO2 emission risks at local spatial scales. A review of existing peer-reviewed literature showed a scarcity of studies assessing CO2 emissions following seagrass disturbance, but the limited empirical evidence partly confirmed the opinion of experts. The literature review indicated that direct and long-term disturbances have the greatest negative impact on soil carbon stocks per unit area, highlighting that immediate management actions after disturbances to recover the seagrass canopy can significantly reduce soil CO2 emissions. We conclude that further empirical evidence assessing global change threats on the seagrass carbon sink capacity is required to aid broader uptake of seagrass into blue carbon policy frameworks. The preliminary findings from this study can be used to estimate the potential risk of CO2 emissions from seagrass habitats under threat and guide nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are known to buffer wave energy, reduce current velocities and hence can provide stability to the coasts. The presence of seagrass on the seabed modifies the dynamics of the benthic boundary layer and thus the sediment transport. The overall aim of this project is to address the limited knowledge on the interactions between seagrass, seabed and the counteracting sedimentary processes by investigating interactions between the intertidal seagrass Zostera noltii and the surrounding sediments. Specifically, I am investigating how this species affects the mean flow, the turbulence in the canopy, and the resulting sediment mobilisation. Zostera noltii shows a strong seasonality, therefore the intertidal area of Ryde, Isle of Wight was monitored monthly over two annual cycles to assess the effect of seasonal changes on sediment characteristics and bed morphology. Grain size trend analysis was carried out in order to investigate the sand transport pathways on the intertidal flat in the region of seagrass. Sediment transport patterns were defined using Grain Trend Analysis. The Ryde intertidal flat is composed mainly of fine, well sorted and positively skewed sand. The transport vectors suggest a westward transport on the west side of Ryde Pier and an on-offshore transport on the east side of Ryde Pier. Gradients in sediment texture and composition were related to the season and influenced by meadow distribution and density. This was attributed to the mechanical trapping of particles and enhanced deposition due to dampening of current and wave action in the meadows. Locations inhabited by seagrass showed less change in bed morphology compared to bare sand areas. The tidal flat was found to be stable or exhibited minor bed accretion (cms) along vegetated profiles. Laboratory experiments carried out in a recirculating and annular flume on Zostera noltii showed that turbulence and mean flow were reduced within the canopy indicating low sediment transport in the region of the seagrass. Seagrass increases deposition in summer by modifying the boundary layer through its above-ground biomass and resists erosion in winter by increasing cohesiveness of the bed through its below-ground biomass (roots and rhizomes). Despite the reduction in seagrass canopy influence on the hydrodynamic forcing, the persistent presence of below-ground biomass all year round reduces sediment transport hence providing stability to the bed.

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems provide a wide variety of services that support human well-being around the world (Barbier et al. 2011). It is estimated that more than 1 billion people live within 100 km of a coast with seagrass meadows, thus potentially benefiting from their provisioning, regulating and cultural services. Seagrasses play a significant global role in supporting food security, mitigating climate change, enriching biodiversity, purifying water, protecting the coastline and controlling diseases (Figure 2). The integrity and provision of services by seagrass meadows are enhanced by their proximity and connectivity to other coastal ecosystems such as tidal marshes, coral reefs, mangrove and kelp forests, and oyster and mussel beds. The maintenance and regulation of these services is therefore essential to support human well-being and promote development in the future.

AB  - Seagrass degradation in the western Indian Ocean is of serious concerns with numerous severe climate events that has impacted Mozambique, as well as South Africa in recent time, highlighting the need for re-establishing these critical habitats. The following paper present a field experiment from Mozambique concerning disturbance-and-recovery effects of Zostera capensis, a highly impacted seagrass species in the region. We undertook trials mimicking disturbance of meadows in terms of digging to collect clams, a common practice in Maputo Bay. Our results indicated that once such anthropogenic impacts are halted, Z. capensis meadows restore itself after 12 months of impact exclusion. In addition, we also conducted seagrass restoration experiment using a manual method, the so-called plug method which, demonstrated to improve the survival rate with 75%, which has large implications for seagrass transplantation projects that are both time consuming and financially costly. The results from this study will further guide the appropriate management to build the best practice in seagrasses meadows restoration and awareness. It is clear from this study that a combination of both impact exclusions and active restoration is bound for best results of seagrass management actions.

AB  - Seagrass conservation is critical for mitigating climate change due to the large stocks of carbon they sequester in the seafloor. However, effective conservation and its potential to provide nature-based solutions to climate change is hindered by major uncertainties regarding seagrass extent and distribution. Here, we describe the characterization of the world’s largest seagrass ecosystem, located in The Bahamas. We integrate existing spatial estimates with an updated empirical remote sensing product and perform extensive ground-truthing of seafloor with 2,542 diver surveys across remote sensing tiles. We also leverage seafloor assessments and movement data obtained from instrument-equipped tiger sharks, which have strong fidelity to seagrass ecosystems, to augment and further validate predictions. We report a consensus area of at least 66,000 km2 and up to 92,000 km2 of seagrass habitat across The Bahamas Banks. Sediment core analysis of stored organic carbon further confirmed the global relevance of the blue carbon stock in this ecosystem. Data from tiger sharks proved important in supporting mapping and ground-truthing remote sensing estimates. This work provides evidence of major knowledge gaps in the ocean ecosystem, the benefits in partnering with marine animals to address these gaps, and underscores support for rapid protection of oceanic carbon sinks.

AB  - Sea-levels have been rising at a faster rate than expected. Because of the maladaptive outcomes of engineering-based hard coastal protection infrastructure, policy makers are looking for alternative adaptation approaches to buffer against coastal flooding—commonly known as nature-based coastal adaptation (NbCA). However, how to implement NbCA under an institutional structure demonstrating ‘inertia’ to alternative adaptation approaches is a question that seeks scientific attention. Building on a case study derived from a highly climate-vulnerable Canadian province, this study shows how the entrepreneurial use of scientific information and institutional opportunities helped institutional actors overcome the inertia. Drawing on secondary document analysis and primary qualitative data, this study offers five key lessons to institutional actors aiming at implementing NbCA: (i) develop knowledge networks to help avoid uncertainty; (ii) identify and utilize opportunities within existing institutions; (iii) distribute roles and responsibilities among actors based on their capacity to mobilize required resources; (iv) provide entrepreneurial actors with decision-making autonomy for developing agreed-upon rules and norms; and (v) facilitate repeated interactions among institutional actors to develop a collaborative network among them. This study, therefore, helps us to understand how to implement a relatively new adaptation option by building trust-based networks among diverse and relevant institutional actors.

AB  - Sea-level rise poses major challenges to coastal landscapes and communities. Sustainable adaptation to sea-level rise has been a growing concern for coastal management authorities, engineers, ecologists, urban planners and designers. A shift from ‘coastal armoring’ and hard engineered ‘defense systems’, to ecologically informed infrastructures has created opportunities and challenges in designing structures that can perform beyond engineering goals and provide ecological and social benefits. Emerging studies determine the importance of ecological knowledge and landscape-based solutions in informing the design of coastal infrastructures; however, there are limited number of projects that demonstrate the most effective design approaches.

This review assesses literature on key emerging topics in sea level rise including: the lasting impact of near-term mitigation on long-term sea-level rise; new global coastal vertical elevation data and their impact on existing sea-level rise projections; and the interaction of sea-level rise with other hazards, including salinization, tropical cyclones and extreme precipitation. We characterize the regional nature of sea-level rise for SIDS and highlight associated impacts and risks. Finally, we review approaches to address sea-level rise as well as limits to adaptation and resultant economic and non-economic loss and damage that may be experienced by SIDS.

AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) is inevitable and so is the risk to the coastal populations and properties. Along the Indian coast, sea levels are rising faster than the global average. Metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Chennai, Kochi and Mumbai would be the most impacted because of sea level rise in future. Mumbai’s sea level is estimated to rise to 0.12m by 2040 and a further by 0.21 m by 2060 compared to 0.04 m in 2020. The rise in sea level along Indian coast will pose risk of flash flooding and submergence of many significant coastal properties and road networks. Mumbai had suffered economic losses worth USD 1.75 billion between 2005 to 2015 due to floods. Developing policies to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of SLR in cities on Indian coastline is necessary. SDG 14 also recognizes the need for sustainably managing and protecting marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts. Vulnerability mapping of habitats along the coastline in advance will provide ample time to direct the efforts towards mitigation and adaptation. There is also a need to develop new market-based instruments to finance the cost of disaster risk mitigation and adaptation.

AB  - Sea hazards are increasingly threatening worldwide coastal areas, which are among the most strategic resources of the Earth in supporting human population, economy and the environment. These hazards enhance erosion processes and flooding events, producing severe socio-economic impacts and posing a challenge to ocean engineers and stakeholders in finding the optimal strategy to protect both the coastal communities and the health of the environment. The impact of coastal hazards is actually worsened not only by an enhancing rate of relative sea level rise and storminess driven by climate changes, but also by increasing urban pressure related to the development of the sea economy. With regard to larger environmental awareness and climate change adaptation needs, the present study focuses on a stepwise approach that supports the actions for coastal protection at Calabaia Beach, which is located in the Marine Experimental Station of Capo Tirone (Cosenza, Italy). These actions first aim to protect humans and coastal assets, then to restore the environment and the local habitat, overcoming the need for the emergency interventions carried out in the last decades and pointing out that healthy ecosystems are more productive and support a sustainable marine economy (“Blue Growth”).

AB  - Sea dikes protect low-lying hinterlands along many coasts all around the world. Commonly, they are designed as embankments with grass covers or grey revetments accounting for the prevailing hydraulic loads. So far, incorporation of ecological aspects in the dike design is limited. With regard to increasing environmental awareness and climate change adaptation needs, the present study reviews methods for ecological enhancement of sea dikes and discusses limitations and challenges related to these methods. In doing so, one key aspect is to maintain dike safety while increasing the ecological value. Potential for ecological enhancement of sea dikes has been found regarding natural or nature-based solutions in the foreshore, dike surface protection measures (vegetated dike covers, hard revetments and dike roads) and the dike geometry. While natural and nature-based solutions in the foreland are investigated thoroughly, so far only few experiences with ecological enhancements of the dike structure itself were gained resulting in uncertainties and knowledge gaps concerning the implementation and efficiency. Additional to technical uncertainties, engineers and ecologists meet the challenge of interdisciplinary collaboration under consideration of societal needs and expectations.

AB  - Scotland's marine and coastal landscapes are facing numerous pressures from climate change, which negatively impacts both ecosystem functioning and communities who live and work along the coasts. Meanwhile in Nigeria, rising sea levels, coastal erosion, increased precipitation, storms, and warmer ocean temperatures pose similar threats to coastal communities and ecosystems. In order to protect coastal communities in both countries from increasing climate change impacts, strategies for adaptation are urgently needed. Nature-based solutions (NbS) - or actions to protect, manage, or restore ecosystems - are promising alternatives to traditional engineering methods for climate adaptation. However, knowledge gaps and uncertainties about NbS currently hamper its widespread uptake. The impacts of NbS are not always recognised at community levels, and high-level science is often misunderstood by the public. Such knowledge gaps are barriers to developing the full potential of NbS for climate, nature, and people across Scotland and Nigeria. Therefore, a clear statement of the implications of NbS for human wellbeing – as well as effective communication with local communities – is vital on the road towards implementing NbS approaches with the buy-in of decision-makers and community stakeholders.

AB  - Sandy coasts represent about one-third of the global coastline and are among the most valuable and most vulnerable areas for humans and many other species. Socio-economic development and climate change impacts, together with traditional engineering for shore protection, have pervasively resulted in coastal squeeze, thereby threatening coastal life and economic activities, and the very survival of coastal ecosystems. In the past, the responses to problems such as land loss, coastal erosion and flooding were primarily reactive, through grey engineering solutions, with little interest shown in the ecosystem processes impacted by coastal armouring. In recent decades, coastal management strategies have become more diverse, embracing traditional engineering solutions alongside ecosystem-based measures. Even so, many of these new strategies still fail to meet sustainability criteria. Inspired by Per Bruun´s “The Ten Demands for Coastal Protection” from 1972, this paper attempts to consider these changes and knowledge acquired since the 1970s, in order to tentatively formulate “Ten Commandments” for the sustainability of sandy coasts in face of climate change and socio-economic development. As such, the paper offers a new vision and briefly summarizes good practices for the management of sandy coasts, particularly useful for those who, at whatever level of influence, could contribute to the long-term realization of this new vision.

AB  - Sand and mud reaching the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) via distributary channels created the delta lobes that, in aggregate, make up the current Deltaic Plain (DP). Sediments transported to the west in the coastal boundary current, in turn, have built the “downstream” Chenier Plain (CP). We review options for restoring the CP coast between the beach dune system and the first series of Cheniers that fronts the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) for ∼200 km to the west of the DP, and contributes 30% to total area of the MRD. The CP was built by marine rather than fluvial processes that have resulted in episodic westward and onshore transport of fine-grained sediments delivered to the inner shelf by the Atchafalaya River distributary. Long-term restoration of the MRD is currently proceeding under the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA). Projects to stabilize the CP coast are being proposed and built to test whether coastal defense structures like breakwaters and groins designed to retard erosion on sandy coasts can be adapted for use on muddy shores where cohesive sediments predominate. An estimated 30 to 50 Mt y−1 of resuspended mud is moved past the CP coast by the coastal boundary current in a feature described as the “Atchafalaya Mud Stream.” Mid- to late-Holocene MRD lobes on the west side of the DP similarly contributed mud to the same part of the inner shelf. Then, as now, a portion of this near-shore suspended sediment flux was diverted into shore-welded mudflats that were colonized by marsh vegetation that offset local shoreline retreat. The CP is a regressive coastal feature, formed since sea level rise and marine transgression slowed, and it has experienced a 19% wetland loss since the early 1930s. Coastal retreat, up to more than 10 m y−1, prevails along more than half of the CP shore. Most structures built on the CP coast are constructed of lightweight materials to reduce settlement and lower deployment costs. If the generally positive results to date are validated, then designs can be optimized to increase transmissivity of high-density “fluid mud” (>10 g l−1) during low-frequency swell, while reducing energy transmission in the higher frequency band occupied by locally generated seas that seem to be most destructive to newly created mudflats and marshes. We show that restoration in the CP can be enhanced by taking advantage of the land building capabilities of mud stored in the nearshore and delivered to the coast during storms. The goal is to use engineered structures to increase the rate at which mud is deposited and retained at the shore, thereby harnessing natural processes to reinforce the coast. The use of dredged sediments for wetland creation augments coastal shoreline enhancement.

AB  - Saltmarsh ecosystems though ecologically important are one of the least studied ecosystems in Asia. This study reviewed the published literature from 1988 to 2021 of India to assess the current status of the data deficient saltmarsh species Porterasia coarctata (Roxb.) within its distribution limits. This saltmarsh species inhabits the lower intertidal silty-sandy habitats of India's west coast and silty-clay habitats of the east coast. In the lower intertidal zone, P. coarctata is mostly associated with Myrostachia wightiana, whereas in the upper intertidal zone the highest chance of presence was for Suaeda maritima (18%) and the lowest for Cressa cretica (1%), S. fruticosa (1%) and Scirpus littoralis (1%). The deep root system of P. coarctata helps in sediment accretion and facilitates the formation of mangrove ecosystems. From this study it was evident that most of the research on P. coarctata in India was part of survey of mangrove ecosystems. In India, significant knowledge gap exists on the reproductive ecology and population trends of this species. Most importantly, the genes responsible for salinity and submergence tolerance of P. coarctata are well documented, that can provide solutions for salt and submergence tolerant rice plants in coastal areas prone to sea level rise. The blue carbon storage potential of P. coarctata is higher than other saltmarsh plants, that can be leveraged as a nature-based solution for CO2 emission reductions. The ecosystem services of P. coarctata can also contribute towards achieving various sustainable development goals (SDG-1,2,6,13 and14). Coastal development, mangrove restoration and marine food provisioning are the most important drivers causing the decline of P. coarctata ecosystems across India. This study proposes a long-term coastal monitoring plan for essential conservation and management of existing P. coarctata beds and preventing further degradation and loss of these ecosystems. This study also showcases species-specific valuation of individual saltmarsh plants at regional scale are essential to catalogue the most efficient saltmarsh plants that can play an important role in future climate change scenarios and serve as a global model.

AB  - Salt marshes provide valuable nature-based, low-cost defences protecting against coastal flooding and erosion. Storm sedimentation can improve the resilience of salt marshes to accelerating rates of sea-level rise, which poses a threat to salt marsh survival worldwide. It is therefore important to be able to accurately detect the frequency of storm activity in longer-term sediment records to quantify how storms contribute to salt marsh resilience. Luminescence is able to infer how long mineral grains were exposed to sunlight prior to burial (e.g., the presence or absence of sediment processing). This study used sediment cores collected from the Ribble Estuary, North West England, to show that luminescence properties of sand-sized K-feldspar grains can diagnose the differential modes of deposition across intertidal settings (i.e., sandflat, mudflat and salt marsh) in longer-term sediment records by detecting the variability in sediment bleaching potential between settings (i.e., sediment exposure to sunlight), thus establishing a framework for the interpretation of luminescence properties of intertidal sediments. It then used modern sediment samples collected before and after a storm event to show how such properties can diagnose changes in sediment processing (i.e., bleaching potential) of mudflat sediments caused by storm activity, despite no changes in sediment composition being recorded by geochemical and particle size distribution analyses. This new luminescence approach can be applied to longer-term sediment records to reveal (and date) changes in the environment of deposition and/or depositional dynamics where there is no obvious stratigraphic evidence of such.

AB  - Salt marshes can provide coastal protection when included in a Nature-based Flood Defence. The magnitude of the protection by the marsh strongly depends on the lateral extent of the salt marsh, and thereby the potentially dynamic location of the salt marsh edge. This study systematically assesses the influence of daily occurring mild weather conditions including waves and sediment availability on the biophysical development of the salt marsh, and retreat and expansion of the marsh edge.

AB  - Salt marshes can protect coastlines against flooding by attenuating wave energy and enhancing shoreline stabilization. However, salt-marsh functioning is threatened by human influences and sea level rise. Although it is known that protection services are mediated by vegetation, little is known about the role of vegetation structure in salt-marsh accretion. We investigated the role of vegetation presence, vegetation type and structural vegetation characteristics in sedimentation and sediment grain size. We established 56 plots on a salt marsh on the Dutch Wadden island of Texel. Plots were divided over four vegetation types contrasting in vegetation structure and varied in elevation and distance to creeks. Vegetation presence was controlled by clipping in subplots. Within each plot, we measured seven vegetation characteristics, sedimentation and the sediment grain size distribution. Furthermore, we explored the effect of the natural variation in vegetation structure on wave attenuation with a simple model approach. For this, we developed vegetation scenarios based on the field measurements of stem height, diameter and density. We found that vegetation presence increased sedimentation on average by 42%. Sedimentation was highest in Salicornia vegetation and increased with stem height and branching level. Grain size also seemed to increase with branching level. Modelled wave attenuation was 7.5 times higher with natural vegetation compared to topography only, was strongest for Spartina vegetation and most sensitive to the natural variance in stem density. Our results can be used to improve predictions of salt-marsh accretion and the implementation of salt marshes in nature-based flood defences.

AB  - Salt marshes attenuate waves and thus have an important function for coastal protection. Biophysical properties of salt-marsh plants play a key role in the process of wave attenuation and can be differentiated by morphological properties such as stem density, vegetation height and aboveground biomass as well as by biomechanical properties related to stem flexibility. Numerical or physical scale models predicting wave attenuation over vegetated surfaces need to include biophysical properties. However, few studies have quantified morphological and biomechanical properties of salt-marsh plants and fewer have considered seasonal and within-marsh spatial variability of biomechanical properties. The aim of this study was to quantify biophysical properties of the common salt-marsh grasses Spartina anglica and Elymus athericus, including stem flexibility and density as well as aboveground biomass, temporally and spatially. Samples were collected in spring and in summer 2014 at a study site located in the Northern German Wadden Sea. Aboveground biomass was harvested in plots of 50 × 50 cm, stem density was determined by counting and flexibility of plant stems was determined with three-point bending tests. Biophysical properties of both species varied significantly between seasons with plant stem stiffness being 5.0 (S. anglica) and 2.9 times (E. athericus) higher and aboveground biomass being 2.1 (S. anglica) and 1.3 times (E. athericus) higher in summer than in spring. Small-scale spatial differences for those biophysical plant properties were found for S. anglica with plant stem stiffness being 4.0 (spring) and 2.8 times (summer) higher and aboveground biomass being 1.6 (spring) and 1.5 times (summer) higher in a landward than in a seaward-located zone. Small-scale spatial differences of biophysical properties were not found in E. athericus. We conclude that variability in biophysical properties should be considered in models and experiments especially for S. anglica when predicting and quantifying marsh wave attenuation capacity.

AB  - Salt marshes are valuable ecosystems that provide important ecosystem services. Given the global scale of marsh loss due to climate change and coastal squeeze, there is a pressing need to identify the critical extrinsic (wind exposure and foreshore morphology) and intrinsic factors (soil and vegetation properties) affecting the erosion of salt marsh edges. In this study, we quantified rates of cliff lateral retreat (i.e., the eroding edge of a salt marsh plateau) using a time series of aerial photographs taken over four salt marsh sites in the Westerschelde estuary, the Netherlands. In addition, we experimentally quantified the erodibility of sediment cores collected from the marsh edge of these four marshes using wave tanks. Our results revealed the following: (i) at the large scale, wind exposure and the presence of pioneer vegetation in front of the cliff were the key factors governing cliff retreat rates; (ii) at the intermediate scale, foreshore morphology was partially related to cliff retreat; (iii) at the local scale, the erodibility of the sediment itself at the marsh edge played a large role in determining the cliff retreat rate; and (iv) at the mesocosm scale, cliff erodibility was determined by soil properties and belowground root biomass. Thus, both extrinsic and intrinsic factors determined the fate of the salt marsh but at different scales. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the scale dependence of the factors driving the evolution of salt marsh landscapes.

AB  - Salt marshes are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, however their continued existence is in doubt in the face of global sea-level rise, especially where development creates coastal squeeze preventing landward migration. Therefore, long-term survival of these ecosystems is in part dependent on sufficient and persistent sediment supply from riverine and marine sources to maintain positive surface elevation equal to or higher than that of relative sea-level rise. The aim of this study was to investigate the sediment deposition and the implication thereof for vertical accretion in a small salt marsh of a microtidal estuary along the south-east coast of South Africa. The estuarine bed sediments were primarily composed of medium-sized sand with only a limited fine-grained fraction (overall mean of 1.3 ± 0.4%, n = 92) confined mostly to the confluence section of the Bitou tributary. Grain size frequency distribution revealed slightly coarse and poorly sorted sediments in the Bitou tributary suggesting deposition during low-energy conditions. The intertidal surface was characterized by silty-sized sediments dominated by clay mineral assemblages. These sediments had a mean organic matter content and bulk density of 7.2 ± 5.48% and 2.02 ± 0.94 g cm

AB  - Salt marshes and oyster reefs are critical ecosystems which are being lost or degraded at an alarming pace around the world. Current restoration efforts are insufficient to compensate for past and current habitat degradation, with restoration often ending in failure or only partial recovery. Increasingly, ecologists are calling for the inclusion of facilitation in coastal restoration efforts as a method to bolster success. Facilitation is a positive interaction in which a habitat modifier reduces local abiotic or biotic stressors, allowing organisms which were previously excluded to persist. Inter-specific positive interactions are predicted to be particularly important in areas of high physical stress. In North Carolina, fringing oyster reefs and salt marsh vegetation facilitate each other’s growth and persistence through attenuation of wave energy and substrate stabilization. These positive interactions represent a promising method to address pressing issues in coastal restoration, specifically, marsh restoration in environments stressed by high wave energy and excessive nutrient enrichment.To date, coastal restoration has largely failed to incorporate the benefits of positive interactions, despite research indicating that such facilitation may increase restoration success. I examined the ability of oyster reefs to mitigate hydrodynamic and nutrient enrichment stress on marsh vegetation (smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora) in two studies at an eroding salt marsh in Beaufort, North Carolina. In Study 1, I constructed restored oyster reefs from two restoration substrates (Oystercatcher, OC; and shell bags, SB) on low- and high-energy shorelines, and compared their abilities to mitigate shoreline retreat, accrete and retain marsh sediment, and promote robust oyster communities. In Study 2, I investigated whether oyster reef presence can mitigate detrimental impacts of nutrient over-enrichment by transplanting and experimentally fertilizing S. alterniflora at a subset of the OC reef sites, comparing their growth and survival to that at control non-reef sites. Study 1 took place from May 2018 to August 2020, while Study 2 occurred in Summer 2019, with each study period including at least one extreme storm event (i.e. hurricane or tropical storm). In Study 1, constructed reefs mitigated marsh retreat on both shorelines, with the OC reefs outperforming SB reefs on the high-energy shoreline. SB reefs on that shoreline were severely damaged by storm events, while OC reefs on both shorelines exhibited steady oyster recruitment and growth. OC reefs hosted higher densities of larger oysters. In Study 2, transplanted vegetation experienced high rates of mortality, which were impacted by a complex interaction between elevation, fertilization, and reef presence. Unsurprisingly, the most waterward portions of plots experienced greatest elevation loss. Reef presence fostered both higher plant survival and higher shoot density, while clonal expansion was greater at control sites. Shoot density decreased over the course of the study, while clonal expansion peaked in late July before also declining. Overall, any effect of fertilization was swamped by the high hydrodynamic stress impacting transplanted vegetation. Conventional restoration approaches are often ineffective in areas of high stress. I highlight the ways in which deliberate decisions regarding oyster reef substrate and siting can maximize protection to salt marsh edges, and critical considerations for future research regarding mitigation of nutrient over-enrichment in threatened salt marsh systems. Harnessing of inter- specific facilitation between native foundation species represents a promising avenue to restore and protect these critical habitats.

AB  - Salt marsh ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change and sea-level rise. Adaptation strategies such as managed realignment, or dyke realignment, allow for the growth of new salt marsh in areas where one had been previously destroyed through dyking by historical settlers. Two newly restored salt marshes in the Bay of Fundy were monitored through this study. The spatial and temporal variations in water content, organic matter content, organic carbon content and sediment grain size were examined across the salt marsh surfaces. This study found that newly restored salt marshes in the Bay of Fundy can sequester carbon immediately after restoration. Carbon sequestration values resemble those in previously restored marshes in the surrounding areas. This study determined that there is a spatial variation in sediment characteristics across the salt marsh surface. This spatial variation is tied to varying elevation within the tidal frame. Spatial variations of sediment characteristics are not exclusively consistent over time but do tend to follow the same patterns. The sediment characteristics measured at both newly restored salt marshes used in this study were compared to previously restored salt marshes in Nova Scotia. All sediment characteristics data falls within similar ranges, creating a better understanding of what sediment characteristics to expect when restoring a salt marsh in the Bay of Fundy.

AB  - Saint Martin’s Island is a tiny island located in Bangladesh that is rich in biodiversity but threatened by many natural disasters, and it is often neglected due to being far from the mainland. Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) is the most urgently required provision for Bangladesh as it is a very easy and inexpensive way to survive natural adversities. In this study, attempts were made to quantify the capacity of an existing Pandanus forest on Saint Martin’s Island to reduce the storm surge disaster risk. For this, satellite images were processed with ErdasImagine and ArcGIS software, and land use and land cover changes were analyzed to determine the changes related to Pandanus trees over time. Storm surge wave height reduction was analyzed using the Bao regression model equation. The results show that the Pandanus tree population increased almost 3-fold from 2010 to 2021, and that the Pandanus trees can reduce the surge height, which will ultimately preserve 75% of the area of the island (2021). The minimum required patch width for the Pandanus tree belt was identified as 4.53 m. The areas highly vulnerable to flooding were also identified in this study.

AB  - River deltas are the most dynamic landforms on earth and have become more prone to disasters due to climate change and rising sea levels. Sea level rise and other coastal hazards, such as coastal erosion, salinity intrusion, and storm surges, affect delta ecosystems and the livelihoods of people depending on them. Many people live in deltas, with several of them experiencing a growing population, which requires a sustainable and integrated approach to balance various and often competing interests, notably ecosystem conservation, biological and cultural diversity, agricultural productivity and other social and economic benefits to support livelihoods. This study proposed coastal protection strategies for the Mekong delta, including nature-based solutions and permeable breakwaters. Although single coastal protection defences are currently the prevailing practices in the region, their success is limited to slowing down the erosion rate. Due to the complexity of the hydrodynamic and morphological regimes and the characteristic of the mangrove mud coast, one single line of defence is neither sustainable nor successful. Accordingly, this study proposes holistic coastal protection strategies for mangrove muddy coasts under climate change, namely multiple lines of defences incorporating first nature-based solutions and green infrastructure. Second, advanced perforated hollow triangle breakwaters are introduced based on principles of environmental exchange and conservation, such as previously applied to the coastline of Tien Giang province. These breakwaters have shown benefits for wave reduction, as well as for stimulating sedimentation and for restoring mangrove ecosystems. Lastly, holistic coastal protection strategies are proposed for the entire coast of the Mekong delta, with comprehensive coastal protection solutions presented for Ben Tre province.

AB  - Rising sea levels are causing more frequent flooding events in coastal areas and generate many issues for coastal communities such as loss of property or damages to infrastructures. To address this issue, this paper reviews measures currently in place and identifies possible control measures that can be implemented to aid preservation of coastlines in the future. Breakwaters present a unique opportunity to proactively address the impact of coastal flooding. However, there is currently a lack of research into combined hard and soft engineering techniques. To address the global need for developing sustainable solutions, three specific breakwater configurations were designed and experimentally compared in the hydraulic laboratory at Coventry University to assess their performance in reducing overtopping and the impact of waves, quantifying the effectiveness of each. The investigation confirmed that stepped configurations work effectively in high amplitudes waves, especially with the presence of a slope angle to aid wave reflection. These results provide a very valuable preliminary investigation into novel sustainable solutions incorporating both artificial and natural based strategies that could be considered by local and national authorities for the planning of future mitigation strategies to defend coastal areas from flooding and erosion.

AB  - Rising sea levels and increasing frequency of extreme events put coastal communities at serious risk. In response, shoreline armoring for stabilization has been widespread; however, this solution does not take ecological aspects of the coasts into account. The “living shoreline” technique includes coastal ecology by incorporating natural habitat features, such as saltmarshes, into shoreline stabilization. However, impacts of living shorelines to adjacent benthic communities, like submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), are not clear yet. In particular, while both marshes and SAV trap sediment necessary for their resilience to environmental change, synergies between the communities are not well understood. To help quantify the ecological and protective (shoreline stabilization) aspects of living shorelines, we present modeling results using the Delft3D-SWAN system on sediment transport between the created saltmarshes of the living shorelines and adjacent SAV in a subestuary of Chesapeake Bay. We used a double numerical approach, first to validate deposition measurements made in the field and second to quantify a sediment balance between the two vegetation communities using an idealized model. This model uses the same numerical domain with different wave heights, periods, and basin slope and includes the presence of rip-rap, often used together with marsh plantings in living shorelines, to look at influences of artificial structures on the sediment exchange between the plant communities. Study results indicate lower shear stress, lower erosion rate, and higher deposition rates within the SAV bed compared to the scenario with only marsh, which helps stabilize bottom sediments by making the sediment balance positive (deposition within the two vegetations higher than sediment loss). The presence of rip-rap resulted in a positive sediment balance especially in case of extreme events, where sediment balance was magnified. Overall, SAV helps stabilize bed level and shoreline, and rip-rap works better with extreme conditions, demonstrating how the right combination of natural and built solutions can work well in terms of ecology and coastal protection.

AB  - Rhizophora mangle, or red mangroves, are halophytes which grow in the intertidal zone along coastlines in southwest Florida. Species of the Rhizophora genus have been shown to provide effective coastal protection, carbon sequestration, and shoreline erosion mitigation through wave and wind attenuation in tropical and subtropical regions for wind waves, boat wakes, and in riverine environments. This article quantifies the wave dissipation ability and effectiveness of red mangroves in the partially exposed Cocohatchee River Channel near Naples, FL, specifically focusing on 41 distinct boat wake events. The data analysis found an average empirical vegetation transmission coefficient of 0.33, indicating that mangroves can cause significant wave dissipation for the observed conditions.

AB  - Restoring and protecting “blue carbon” ecosystems - mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows - are actions considered for increasing global carbon sequestration. To improve understanding of which management actions produce the greatest gains in sequestration, we used a spatially explicit model to compare carbon sequestration and its economic value over a broad spatial scale (2500 km of coastline in southeastern Australia) for four management scenarios: (1) Managed Retreat, (2) Managed Retreat Plus Levee Removal, (3) Erosion of High Risk Areas, (4) Erosion of Moderate to High Risk Areas. We found that carbon sequestration from avoiding erosion-related emissions (abatement) would far exceed sequestration from coastal restoration. If erosion were limited only to the areas with highest erosion risk, sequestration in the non-eroded area exceeded emissions by 4.2 million Mg CO2 by 2100. However, losing blue carbon ecosystems in both moderate and high erosion risk areas would result in net emissions of 23.0 million Mg CO2 by 2100. The removal of levees combined with managed retreat was the strategy that sequestered the most carbon. Across all time points, removal of levees increased sequestration by only an additional 1 to 3% compared to managed retreat alone. Compared to the baseline erosion scenario, the managed retreat scenario increased sequestration by 7.40 million Mg CO2 by 2030, 8.69 million Mg CO2 by 2050, and 16.6 million Mg CO2 by 2100. Associated economic value followed the same patterns, with large potential value loss from erosion greater than potential gains from conserving or restoring ecosystems. This study quantifies the potential benefits of managed retreat and preventing erosion in existing blue carbon ecosystems to help meet climate change mitigation goals by reducing carbon emissions.

AB  - Restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems is essential to meet both national and global conservation targets and to counteract declines in coastal marine ecosystems. However, despite its status as a world leader in marine protection, Australia is lagging behind other countries in the implementation of coastal and marine restoration. Effective legislative frameworks that support the implementation of coastal and marine restoration as a management tool remains a key barrier to large-scale implementation of coastal and marine restoration in Australia and many other regions. We analyzed restoration projects and their policy frameworks in Australia, North America and Europe to identify the range of policy approaches for marine and coastal restoration. We then evaluated the legislative frameworks for coastal and marine restoration in two states in Australia (Queensland and New South Wales), to assess the current restoration permitting process and identify how different legislative and policy approaches could facilitate coastal and marine restoration projects. We identified two specific areas where improvements could be made to facilitate marine coastal restoration in Australia: increased transparency and better integration into coastal policy. Coastal and marine restoration in Australia is undertaken without appropriate and effective policy at the local, regional and national levels, which likely impedes its broader use as a management strategy. The policy and legislative changes and amendments outlined in this article can streamline the coastal and marine restoration process and thereby improve uptake of marine and coastal restoration in Australia.

AB  - Responsiveness and resilience to coastal disasters is an increasingly critical need for governments, businesses, and communities as the intensity of hurricanes, coastal storms and sea level rise exacerbates flood and erosion damages. The number and severity of disasters have increased significantly over the past two decades while intense coastal development has steadily degraded the protective and other ecosystem benefits from natural habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses. Such ecosystems can provide cost-effective, long-term risk reduction and other benefits to coastal communities. Yet easy, low-cost methodologies for incorporating such natural capital values into metrics that can inform policy and investment decisions have been lacking until recently. Whereas new approaches and studies have developed ways to quantify and assess such risk reduction benefits, finding the data to assess such services in data poor environments, both for regional and local scales, remains challenging. This paper outlines how breakthroughs in data technologies can help with incorporating ecosystem benefits into real-world policy and investment applications. Specific new data and analytical technologies are increasingly being used to quantify coastal risk reduction and other ecosystem benefits. We review several case studies where ecosystem benefits were quantified based on new data technologies and used for policy and investment strategies to improve a broader suite of ecosystem benefits to coastal communities. Equipping public and private sector actors with cost-effective and accessible approaches and tools to incorporate nature-based solutions into disaster risk management and coastal zone management planning more generally can transform climate resilience strategies around the world.

AB  - Rehabilitated and restored mangrove ecosystems have important ecological, economic, and social values for coastal communities. Although a sine qua non of successful mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects is accurate attention to local hydrology and basic biology of mangrove trees and their associated fauna, their long-term success depends on far more axes, each with their own challenges. Rehabilitation projects: are planned, designed, executed, and managed by people with diverse backgrounds and different scientific and socio-political agendas; need to be responsive to these multiple stakeholders and agents who hold different values; are often influenced by laws and treaties spanning local to international scales; and must be able to adapt and evolve both geomorphologically and socioeconomically over decades-to-centuries in the context of a rapidly changing climate. We view these challenges as opportunities for innovative approaches to rehabilitation and restoration that engage new and larger constituencies. Restored mangrove ecosystems can be deliberately designed and engineered to provide valuable ecosystem services, be adaptable to climatic changes, and to develop platforms for educating nonspecialists about both the successes and failures of restored mangrove ecosystems. When mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects are developed as experiments, then can be used as case-studies and more general models to inform policy- and decision-makers and guide future restoration efforts. Achieving this vision will require new investment and dedication to research and adaptive management practices. These ideas are illustrated with examples from mangrove restoration and rehabilitation projects in the Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean regions, the two hotspots of mangrove biodiversity and its ongoing loss and degradation.

AB  - Reef-building bivalves like oysters and mussels are conspicuous ecosystem engineers in intertidal and subtidal coastal environments. By forming complex, three-dimensional structures on top of the sediment surface, epibenthic bivalve reefs exert strong bio-physical interactions, thereby influencing local hydro- and morphodynamics as well as surrounding habitats and associated species. The spatial impact of the ecosystem engineering effects of reef-building bivalves is much larger than the size of the reef. By influencing hydrodynamics oysters and mussels modify the sedimentary environment far beyond the boundaries of the reef, affecting morphological and ecological processes up to several hundreds of meters. Being key-stone species in many coastal environments, reef-building bivalves are increasingly recognized for their role in delivering important ecosystem services that serve human wellbeing. Here we focus on two services, namely the regulating service coastal protection (coastal erosion prevention, shoreline stabilization) and the supporting habitat for species service (enhancement of biodiversity and diversification of the landscape). Due to their wave dampening effects, reef-building bivalve reefs are increasingly used for shoreline protection and erosion control along eroding coastlines, as an alternative to artificial shoreline hardening. The facilitative interactions at long-distances of bivalve reefs provide biodiversity benefits and more specifically facilitate or protect other valuable habitats such as intertidal flats, sea grasses, saltmarshes and mangroves. Two case studies are used to demonstrate how bivalve reefs can be restored or constructed for shoreline protection and erosion control, thereby focusing on oyster reefs: (1) Oyster reefs for shoreline protection in coastal Alabama, USA, and (2) Oyster reefs as protection against tidal flat erosion, Oosterschelde, The Netherlands. It is argued that bivalve reefs should be promoted as nature-based solutions that provide biodiversity benefits and coastal protection and help in climate change mitigation and adaptation. In order to successfully restore these habitats practitioners should consider a general framework in which habitat requirements, environmental setting and long-distance interdependence between habitats are mutually considered.

AB  - Reef ecosystems all over the world are in decline and managers urgently need information that can assess management interventions and set national conservation targets. We assess the conservation status and risk of ecosystem collapse for the Oyster Reef Ecosystem of Southern and Eastern Australia, which comprises two community sub-types established by Saccostrea glomerata (Sydney rock oyster) and Ostrea angasi (Australian flat oyster), consistent with the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems risk assessment process. We established: (i) key aspects of the ecosystem including: ecological description, biological characteristics, condition and collapse thresholds, natural and threatening processes; (ii) previous and current extent of occurrence and current area of occupancy; and (iii) its likelihood of collapse within the next 50–100 years. The most severe risk rating occurred for Criterion A: Reduction in Extent (since 1750) and Criterion D: Disruption of biotic processes (since 1750), although assessment varied from Least Concern to Critically Endangered amongst the four criteria assessed. Our overall assessment ranks the risk of collapse for the ecosystem (including both community sub-types) as Critically Endangered with a high degree of confidence. Our results suggest the need for rapid intervention to protect remaining reefs and undertake restoration at suitable sites. Several restoration projects have already demonstrated this is feasible, and Australia is well equipped with government policies and regulatory mechanisms to support the future conservation and recovery of temperate oyster ecosystems.

AB  - Red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) forests protect hundreds of miles of Florida’s shorelines from erosion and wave damage associated with severe storms and daily wave action. Shorelines are often protected from erosion with man-made structures such as seawalls, revetments, and breakwaters. However, these man-made structures disrupt natural ecosystems and cause scour and erosion in surrounding areas. The presence of mangroves not only prevents erosion but shelters marine life and filters water, promoting ecological health. Mangroves are now being implemented for wave energy reduction and shoreline stabilization, but there is little quantitative data about the precise sediment transport induced or prevented by mangroves in Florida. This study simulates shoreline sediment transport through mangroves in a Florida estuary using average wave conditions and annual water level fluctuations to determine necessary widths for shoreline stabilization. A dowel system was verified as a physical representation of live red mangroves for wave dissipation effects. The sediment transport in the laboratory simulated the cross-shore sediment transport for coastlines with existing mangroves and similar estuarine parameters. Knowing the effective forest width for shoreline stabilization at multiple seasonal water levels will aid implementation of mangroves as living shorelines in areas such as the IRL where multiple water level dynamics occur. Planting the proper forest width will stabilize the shoreline and ensure the plant’s survival. Knowing the minimum width needed will also allow the plant to be installed efficiently over a large amount of shoreline. Use of mangroves for shoreline stabilization and living breakwaters will be beneficial to the plant itself and the health of tropical ecosystem.

AB  - Recently, coastal protection has developed to one of the most crucial issues, resulting in a significant number of studies on the role of vegetation in shore protection. From the review of these studies, there is a general agreement that many complex physical processes are involved in the interaction of waves and currents with vegetation. Hence, there is still a need for further research of wave and/or current-vegetation interactions to improve the understanding of eco-hydraulic processes. This study1 therefore aims to improve the understanding of the highly complex wave-current-vegetation interaction, including a more precise and systematic identification of the most influential parameters on the wave attenuation. For this purpose, a new porous media-based approach for the modelling of wave attenuation by stiff vegetation is applied using the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model, which is extended for flexible vegetation by considering the dynamic response of flexible vegetation subject to water waves/currents. The CFD model is systematically validated against laboratory tests for wave attenuation by both stiff and flexible vegetation. In addition, the wave damping effect of vegetation is investigated also for combined wave-current, which has been considered only in very few studies due to the high complexity of wavecurrent-vegetation interactions. A systematic parameter study using the extended model is performed for various vegetation and hydrodynamic conditions in order to better understand the relative contribution of the parameters and physical processes to wave attenuation by vegetation and thus, to provide a substantially larger dataset for the development of a new set of prediction formula for wave attenuation by vegetation under pure wave and wave-current conditions. The results show that the proposed porous media modelling approach and the obtained new formulae perform relatively well for predicting wave attenuation by both stiff and flexible vegetation. Moreover, an improved insight not only into the effects of vegetation and hydraulic parameters but also into the mutual interaction of the individual parameters on wave attenuation is provided, highlighting the necessity to also consider the effects of these parameters in combination.

AB  - Recently, coastal protection has developed to one of the most crucial and urgent issues, resulting in a significant number of research studies on the role of vegetation in shore protection. In addition, vegetation fields in coastal area have the capability to provide a habitat for a variety of valuable organisms, result in sedimentation and stabilization of the bed and hence, could be important not only in coastal protection but also in coastal eco-system conservation. There is a growing interest in utilizing soft structures as well as a combination of hard and soft structures for coastal protection. Though the potential of coastal vegetation in shoreline protection has long been recognized, many biotic and physical factors interact to affect the protective capacity of vegetation. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to understand the wave-vegetation interactions and the damping effects of vegetative fields. From the review of published studies about vegetation effects on wave attenuation, there is a general agreement that many complex physical processes are involved in the interaction of waves and currents with vegetation. Hence, there is still a need for further research of wave and/or current-vegetation interactions to improve the understanding of eco-hydraulic processes. In most previous studies, the effect of underlying currents on wave energy dissipation by vegetation was generally omitted because of its complexity. However, in the natural environment, most vegetation meadows are exposed to waves superimposed on a tidal flow and the presence of underlying currents may affect the wave-damping capacity of vegetation. To the best of the author's knowledge, there are only very few studies that address the effect of currents on wave attenuation by vegetation. From these studies, it is concluded that an underlying current should be taken into account for evaluating wave attenuation by vegetation; ignoring that the effect of underlying currents may result in incorrect predictions of the wave-attenuating capacity of vegetation in tidal environments. Therefore, further research is necessary to enhance the knowledge of wave-current-vegetation interaction and to quantify the effect of underlying currents on wave attenuation by vegetation. This study therefore aims to improve the understanding of the highly complex hydrodynamic processes involved in the attenuation of waves and currents by flexible vegetation, including a more precise and systematic identification of the key parameters affecting the wave attenuation. For this purpose, a new porous-media based approach for the modelling of wave attenuation by vegetation is applied using the CFD solver “PorousWaveFoam” in the frame of OpenFOAM® . This model solves the Volume-Averaged Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (VARANS) equations for the simulation of flow in porous media without representing the exact geometry of the pores forming the porous media. For the determination of flow resistance, an equivalent porosity (???), developed based on the frontal area per bed area (Afront*), and the distance between the plants (ΔS), as the characteristic length scale, are utilized in the VARANS equations. For flexible vegetation, the most suitable empirical formulation for the deflected plant height within a meadow is introduced in the model, and the extended model is systematically validated against laboratory tests under pure wave and wave-current conditions. A systematic parameter study using the extended model is performed to better understand the relative contribution of the physical processes to the attenuation of waves by vegetation and thus, to provide a substantially larger dataset for the development of new formulae for the prediction of wave attenuation by flexible vegetation under pure wave and wave-current conditions. The results show that the proposed porous media approach and the developed formulae perform relatively well for predicting wave attenuation by flexible vegetation. Moreover, recommendations are provided to extend the range of applicabil ty of the proposed model and the new formulae, and to further improve the understanding of the physical processes underlying wave-attenuation by flexible vegetation.

AB  - Recent salt marsh and barrier island restoration efforts in the northern Gulf of Mexico have focused on optimizing self-sustaining attributes of restored marshes to provide maximum habitat value and storm protection to vulnerable coastal communities. Salt marshes in this region are dominated by Spartina alterniflora and Avicennia germinans, two species that are valued for their ability to stabilize soils in intertidal salt marshes. We conducted a controlled greenhouse study to investigate the influences of substrate type, nutrient level, and marsh elevation on the growth and biomass allocation of S. alterniflora and A. germinans, and the consequent effects on soil development and stability. S. alterniflora exhibited optimal growth and survival at the lowest elevation (− 15 cm below the water surface) and was sensitive to high soil salinities at higher elevations (+ 15 cm above the water surface). A. germinans performed best at intermediate elevations but was negatively affected by prolonged inundation at lower elevations. We found that although there was not a strong effect of substrate type on plant growth, the development of stressful conditions due to the use of suboptimal materials would likely be exacerbated by placing the soil at extreme elevations. Soil shear strength was significantly higher in experimental units containing either S. alterniflora or A. germinans compared to unvegetated soils, suggesting that plants effectively contribute to soil strength in newly placed soils of restored marshes. As marsh vegetation plays a critical role in stabilizing shorelines, salt marsh restoration efforts in the northern Gulf of Mexico and other storm impacted coasts should be designed at optimal elevations to facilitate the establishment and growth of key marsh species.

AB  - Recent coastal storms and associated recovery efforts have led to increased investment in nature-based coastal protection, including restoration of salt marshes and construction of living shorelines. In particular, many of these efforts focus on increasing vertical elevation through sediment nourishment, where sediment is removed from the tidal channel and placed on the marsh plain, or preventing lateral erosion through shoreline protection. In the USA alone, millions of dollars have been allocated or spent on these coastal protection solutions over the last few decades because of their perceived sustainability and ecologically positive co-benefits including habitat provision and carbon sequestration. These projects would benefit from integration of sediment transport pathways, budgets, and metrics during planning and modeling of restoration outcomes, in order to evaluate sustainability before investment. This is analogous to the decades of experience with coastal management and engineering on the open coast. Salt marshes are geomorphic features that rely partially on external sediment supply to maintain their network of tidal channels, intertidal flats, and marsh plain. Removing sediment from one component of the overall system to nourish another component may be counterproductive, given that the net sediment budget is unchanged. For example, dredging a tidal channel beyond its equilibrium condition will cause it to fill with sediment from the tidal flat or elsewhere in the system. This may cause slumping of the marsh edge, or over-deepening of other sections of the channel to compensate. Similarly, shoreline protection that prevents edge erosion hampers the marsh plain’s ability to accrete on the levee and naturally transgress landward or it starves other components of the system of regularly supplied sediment. A limited vertical or lateral-only perspective, instead of a three-dimensional perspective, during project planning and evaluation may lead to suboptimal decision-making regarding restoration priorities, approaches, and outcomes. I contend that before significant investments are made in marsh restoration through sediment nourishment or shoreline protection, sediment transport measurements and models that consider sediment dynamics should be integrated into the early phases of restoration planning. This will help identify where and under what conditions marsh restoration will most likely be successful and economically justified. Triaging and prioritizing is then possible, which is a sustainable approach for restoration, given the persistent vulnerability of marshes to sea-level rise, storms, and sediment deficits.

AB  - Quantitative investigation of wave attenuation by flexible vegetation is an increasingly prominent area in wave mechanics. Given that the existing XBeach non-hydrostatic wave model can only simulate wave attenuation by rigid vegetation, a mechanical model for simulating submerged flexible vegetation dynamics driven by waves and a coupling simulation method between the flexible vegetation dynamic model and the XBeach non-hydrostatic wave model were proposed. To assess the performance of the proposed coupled model, a wave flume experiment was conducted. This study demonstrates the validity of the new flexible vegetation dynamic model in simulating forces and motions of a single submerged flexible stem. The validation between modeled results and experimental data shown that the coupled model is capable of reproducing the wave attenuation in the presence of flexible vegetation. The above results further indicate that the coupling implementation is valid and reliable. Besides, this study further confirms that flexible vegetation is able to attenuate wave height, and the elasticity modulus of flexible vegetation plays a vital role in wave attenuation when all the other variables are invariant. This study can broaden the application of the XBeach model and provide technical support for the engineering practice of coastal nature-based solutions.

AB  - Quantifying total carbon (TC) stocks in soil across various mangrove ecosystems is key to understanding the global carbon cycle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Estimating mangrove TC at a large scale remains challenging due to the difficulty and high cost of soil carbon measurements when the number of samples is high. In the present study, we investigated the capability of Sentinel-2 multispectral data together with a state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technique, which is a combination of CatBoost regression (CBR) and a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection and optimization (the CBR-GA model) to estimate the mangrove soil C stocks across the mangrove ecosystems in North Vietnam. We used the field survey data collected from 177 soil cores. We compared the performance of the proposed model with those of the four ML algorithms, i.e., the extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), the light gradient boosting machine regression (LGBMR), the support vector regression (SVR), and the random forest regression (RFR) models. Our proposed model estimated the TC level in the soil as 35.06–166.83 Mg ha−1 (average = 92.27 Mg ha−1) with satisfactory accuracy (R2 = 0.665, RMSE = 18.41 Mg ha−1) and yielded the best prediction performance among all the ML techniques. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 data combined with the CBR-GA model can improve estimates of the mangrove TC at 10 m spatial resolution in tropical areas. The effectiveness of the proposed approach should be further evaluated for different mangrove soils of the other mangrove ecosystems in tropical and semi-tropical regions.

AB  - Public policy actions to promote the use of living shorelines have been implemented by regional and national governmental entities in the United States and Europe. In the United States, many coastal states have opted for either legislative requirements or the more popular option of employing incentives or fiscal aid for the implementation of living shorelines as a preferred shoreline management approach. The living shoreline management approaches represent a paradigm shift as they work with rather than against natural nearshore processes. Many of the criticisms voiced are related to the misidentification of a practice that does not meet standard criteria as a living shoreline. While living shorelines are grounded in well-established restoration science and practices, these projects are designed in different ways to accommodate both human use and ecological goals. The potential added value of a dynamic living shoreline serving as a climate adaptation strategy to conserve coastal resilience makes that goal particularly meaningful.

AB  - Protection and restoration of natural infrastructure are fairly new tactics to reduce coastal flood hazards. Increasingly, floodplain managers and environmental organizations have advanced use of these solutions and communities have embraced them, owing to the perceived multiple benefits derived from these projects. Assessing progress in the use of natural infrastructure solutions requires means to account for projects. One way to measure progress is to track investments made in such projects. This paper analyzes and estimates the United States’ investments in natural infrastructure and provides a replicable method for determining whether a project qualifies as an investment in natural infrastructure that could reduce flood hazard and, therefore, have a coastal risk reduction benefit. Estimates of annual investment between 2012 and 2018 indicate increasing, yet variable, annual investment. Better data availability would improve the accuracy of findings.

AB  - Protecting existing mangrove forests is a priority for global conservation because of the wide range of services that these coastal forests provide to humankind. Despite the recent reduction in global rates of mangrove loss, high historical loss rates mean that there are at least 800,000 ha globally that are potentially suitable for mangrove re-establishment. Recently deposited mud banks or intertidal, previously terrestrial, land might provide additional habitat for expanding mangrove areas locally. There is a long history of mangrove rehabilitation. However, despite numerous good examples of, and growing expertise in, natural or assisted (re-)establishment activities, most mangrove planting efforts, for instance, either fail entirely or meet with only limited success. Exposed to waves and currents and subject to tidal inundation, mangroves differ from terrestrial forests, and approaches to, or tools for, terrestrial forest restoration cannot easily be transferred to mangrove forests. Successful mangrove (re-)establishment usually requires a robust understanding of the abiotic and biotic conditions of the chosen site, the ecological requirements of the mangrove species used or facilitated, the reasons for previous mangrove loss or degradation, as well as the barriers–both societal and ecological–that have prevented natural recovery to date. Because most mangrove forests are socio-ecological systems, with which local human populations are intimately engaged, (re-)establishment will normally require the support of, and engagement with, local communities and other local stakeholders. Here, we summarize where, when and why (re-)establishment of mangroves is needed and how to assess this need. We discuss a range of potential aims and goals of mangrove (re-)establishment along with potential pitfalls along the way from conceiving the initial idea to its realization. We compare different technical and conceptual approaches to mangrove (re-)establishment, their challenges and opportunities, and their design and financial requirements, as well as potential solutions. We ground our final outlook and recommendations on examples of successful efforts and the factors that rendered (re-)establishment successful in the past.

AB  - Protected areas safeguard biodiversity, ensure ecosystem functioning, and deliver ecosystem services to communities. However, only ~16% of the world's land area is under some form of protection, prompting international calls to protect at least 30% by 2030. We modeled the outcomes of achieving this 30 × 30 target for terrestrial biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and nutrient regulation. We find that the additional ~2.8 million ha of habitat that would be protected would benefit 1134 ± 175 vertebrate species whose habitats currently lack any form of protection, as well as contribute to either avoided carbon emissions or carbon dioxide sequestration, equivalent to 10.9 ± 3.6 GtCO<sub>2</sub> year<sup>-1</sup> (28.4 ± 9.4% of the global nature-based climate-change mitigation potential). Furthermore, expansion of the protected area network would increase its ability to regulate water quality and mitigate nutrient pollution by 142.5 ± 31.0 MtN year<sup>-1</sup> (28.5 ± 6.2% of the global nutrient regulation potential).

AB  - Predictive tools are widely used to study coastal and deltaic systems in support of basic research, planning efforts, engineering design, and the implementation of restoration or protection strategies. They have been extensively used to evaluate the effectiveness of natural and nature-based solutions (NNBS) to support ecosystem functions and services of coastal ecosystems and human communities experiencing increased risk from sea-level rise and severe storms. The potential benefits of NNBS are being increasingly recognized, particularly in remote areas or areas that are either technically or financially infeasible to be protected with levees or other difficult engineering alternatives. Local communities, however, are often excluded from proposing, screening, or evaluating NNBS as restoration and protection strategies. Communities are also not sufficiently involved in the development or application of the predictive tools. This research effort outlines an approach to developing knowledge-based predictive tools and a community engagement process to evaluate NNBS strategies proposed predominantly by local communities. Incorporating knowledge from local communities benefits and potentially improves the performance of predictive tools and their ability to capture visible trends and observations. To illustrate this concept, the authors present landscape models for coastal Louisiana that successfully reproduced the frequency of flooding of local roads, rate of shoreline erosion, salinity pattern changes, and presence/absence of key species (e.g., brown shrimp, oysters, and so forth). While these qualitative measures are not a substitute for well-established rigorous and quantitative model performance assessment approaches, they offer an effective approach to engage local communities and incorporate their knowledge in the development of the predictive models and the proposed protection and restoration strategies to be examined.

AB  - Polders are subject to significant threats and often fail to protect the hinterland during cyclone induced storm surges. This study investigated the impact of mangrove afforestation in attenuating storm surge impacts on the embankment, as well as the social benefits of adapting this measure. Hydrodynamic model Delft-3D and ArcGIS 10.3 have been used to simulate, calculate and visualize coastal flood inundation condition. Primary and secondary source information were used to validate the model and assess social benefits of afforestation. For polder 47/4, the presence of 1.61 km2 afforestation on the foreshore, protected additional 3 km2 land from inundation during cyclone Sidr. While increasing polder height to 7 m slightly influenced inundation extent by reducing it 0.3 km2, additional afforestation of the same roughness as exists now, helped to further reduce inundation depth in the hinterland. Social benefits provided by the existing forest were also considerable as local people collect fuelwood and Nipa palm regularly. While fuelwood was used for non-commercial uses, Nipa palm, on the other hand, was used by poor village women for preparing mats to sell at the local market. From the collected data, net benefit of this forest was calculated to be Tk. 5990.68 ($70.20)/hectare/year.

AB  - Oysters are described as estuarine ecosystem engineers because their reef structures provide habitat for a variety of flora and fauna, alter hydrodynamics, and affect sediment composition. To what spatial extent oyster reefs influence surrounding infauna and sediment composition remains uncertain. We sampled sediment and infauna across 8 intertidal mudflats at distances up to 100 m from oyster reefs within coastal bays of Virginia, USA, to determine if distance from reefs and physical site characteristics (reef elevation, local hydrodynamics, and oyster cover) explain the spatial distributions of infauna and sediment. Total infauna density increased with distance away from reefs; however, the opposite was observed for predatory crustaceans (primarily crabs). Our results indicate a halo surrounding the reefs of approximately 40 m (using an increase in ~25% of observance as the halo criterion). At 90 m from reefs, bivalves and gastropods were 70% more likely to be found (probability of observance), while there was an approximate 4-fold decrease for large crustaceans compared to locations adjacent to reefs. Increases in percent oyster reef cover and/or mean reef area did not statistically alter infauna densities but showed a statistical correlation with smaller sediment grain size, increased organic matter, and reduced flow rates. Weaker flow conditions within the surrounding mudflats were also associated with smaller grain sizes and higher organic matter content, suggesting multiple drivers on the spatial distribution of sediment composition. This study emphasizes the complexity of bio-physical couplings and the considerable spatial extent over which oyster reefs engineer intertidal communities.

AB  - Oyster populations within the coastal bays of Virginia have greatly declined, mainly due to overharvesting and disease, and past restoration efforts have largely focused on increasing their populations. Current restoration goals have now expanded to simultaneously procure the wider ecosystem services oysters can offer, including shoreline protection and ecosystem diversification. However, tradeoffs exist in designing artificial reefs because it is unlikely one design will optimize all services. This study compares the services provided by reef designs varying in elevation and width located adjacent to an intertidal marsh within a coastal bay of VA, USA. We quantified wave attenuation to determine potential coastal protection of the adjacent marsh, and changes to sediment composition and infaunal communities before and after reef construction for 3 years. After construction, we also quantified oyster size and population density to compare high and low elevation reef designs. High elevation reefs were more effective at attenuating waves and fostering oyster growth compared to low elevation reefs. Oysters atop high elevation reefs were on average approximately twice as dense and 20% larger than those on low elevation designs. Reef width had a minimal effect on oyster population density; densities on high and low reefs were similar for designs with one or three rows. The presence of oyster reefs also increased infaunal diversity and sediment organic matter. Our results indicate that artificial reef design can differentially affect the services provided through restoration, and elevation is especially important to consider when designing for oyster population enhancement and coastal protection.

AB  - Owing to their high shoreline-to-land-area ratios, islands are especially sensitive to coastal change and their inhabitants especially vulnerable to associated impacts. In places along island coasts where shoreline recession is particularly noticeable and/or its impacts most severe, perhaps because adjacent population densities are unusually high, a common response has been to build a seawall. While this solution may appear instinctively correct, studies suggest otherwise, even to the point where seawall construction, particularly outside urban areas, might be considered maladaptive – neither solving the intended problem in the short-term nor helping coastal peoples cope effectively with longer-term shoreline change. Seawall construction can be viewed as part of a broader group of maladaptive solutions that are uncritically embraced by island peoples who may judge the efficacy of these solutions by their success in (wealthier) continental or urban contexts. More effective and sustainable approaches involve nature-based solutions in the short term and planning for transformative responses involving relocation in the longer term.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the development of municipal societies along flood-prone areas such as waterfronts and riverbanks has increased rapidly, causing flood-induced disasters more often than ever before. Flood defense systems have defaulted to gray infrastructure for many centuries. However, more recent storms such as Superstorm Sandy revealed the shortcomings of gray solutions, and therefore the notion of adaptability has been directed to the use of green infrastructure. In flood risk management, nature-based strategies have already proven considerable flood-reducing potential while effectively conserving the ecosystem. However, while nature-based approaches are extremely beneficial in preserving the ecological characteristics of the region, they cannot be solely relied on when it comes to rarely occurring events such as extreme floods. Best management practices (BMPs) are one of the most commonly used safeguards in which natural elements can be integrated into traditional infrastructure designs. In this paper, different strategies are proposed to highlight the immense effects of combining green and gray approaches on both flood mitigation and prevention cost. These strategies focus on flow through vegetation (dense plants), which could be patterned as flow through porous media; and were applied to Westchester Creek, New York. Suggested conceptual designs were then simulated in a hydrologic model. Flood inundation maps generated through the modeling process were then compared in five different scenarios including before and after BMPs. The results of this study showed how the combination of levee and vegetation could significantly lower surge effects while proving to be cost-effective. The methodology outlined in this paper can be used for other urban coastal settings to plan for flood preparedness.

AB  - Over the past decade, coastal communities and ecosystems in the Northeast United States have begun to face acute and chronic impacts of climate change. Extreme events such as Superstorm Sandy caused stakeholders in this region to examine what information is needed to implement adaptation and mitigation plans to prepare for the next major storm. The objective of this study was to determine research needs identified by stakeholders in the Northeast needed for decision-support and policy creation so that scientists can target future research efforts to fill gaps. Modeled after document analysis methods in Dilling et al. (2014), this study examines documents sourced from local and regional organizations in both the public and private sectors to determine gaps in information necessary for climate resilience planning. Stakeholders throughout the Northeast expressed a need for solution-based research, in particular natural and nature-based solutions such as wetlands. Additionally, there was a need to better understand the economic impacts of climate change on key industries in the region as well as cost-benefit analyses of different adaptation options. It was also determined that government organizations, such as Sea Grant, play a crucial role in supporting stakeholder needs assessments both in terms of funding and providing necessary expertise. This study provides a baseline of stakeholder-expressed research needs in the Northeast to start the conversation between communities and researchers interested in conducting useable science.

AB  - Over recent years, many coastal engineering projects have employed the use of soft solutions as these are generally less environmentally damaging than hard solutions. However, in some cases, local conditions hinder the use of soft solutions, meaning that hard solutions have to be adopted or, sometimes, a combination of hard and soft measures is seen as optimal. This research reviews the use of hard coastal structures on the foreshore (groynes, breakwaters and jetties) and onshore (seawalls and dikes). The purpose, functioning and local conditions for which these structures are most suitable are outlined. A description is provided on the negative effects that these structures may have on morphological, hydrodynamic and ecological conditions. To reduce or mitigate these negative impacts, or to create new ecosystem services, the following nature-based adaptations are proposed and discussed: (1) applying soft solutions complementary to hard solutions, (2) mitigating morphological and hydrodynamic changes and (3) ecologically enhancing hard coastal structures. The selection and also the success of these potential adaptations are highly dependent on local conditions, such as hydrodynamic forcing, spatial requirements and socioeconomic factors. The overview provided in this paper aims to offer an interdisciplinary understanding, by giving general guidance on which type of solution is suitable for given characteristics, taking into consideration all aspects that are key for environmentally sensitive coastal designs. Overall, this study aims to provide guidance at the interdisciplinary design stage of nature-based coastal defence structures.

AB  - Our world is a blue planet with extensive ocean areas providing ecosystem goods and services that are critical to our life on Earth. Yet historically we have utilised the oceans with scant regard for sustainability, on the understanding that resources were ever plentiful and that our activities could not materially impact on the oceans. We have known for some time that these beliefs are wrong. In some cases, the effects of human activities have been acute with extreme impacts affecting localised areas and regions; in other situations our impacts have been extreme because they are globally significant, caused by cumulative actions from multiple sources. In both cases the results are environmental degradation and ecosystem damage. Simultaneously, the oceans provide a range of natural extremes – deep seas, freezing waters and extreme weather events – with impacts exacerbated by climate change. If we are to achieve sustainable utilisation of our oceans and blue economy goals we must better understand and respond to these extreme environments, activities, events and impacts. This chapter outlines the background and justification for a focus on marine extremes, the impetus for this book and the breadth of the multi-disciplinary contributions.

AB  - Our planet is traversing the age of human-induced climate change and biodiversity loss. Projected global warming of 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial levels and related greenhouse gas emission pathways will bring about detrimental and irreversible impacts on the interconnected natural and human ecosystem. A global warming of 2 ºC could further exacerbate the risks across the sectors of biodiversity, energy, food, and water. Time- and cost-effective solutions and strategies are required for strengthening humanity’s response to the present environmental and societal challenges. Coastal seascape ecosystems including seagrasses, corals, mangrove forests, tidal flats, and salt marshes have been more recently heralded as nature-based solutions for mitigating and adapting to the climate-related impacts. This is due to their ability to absorb and store large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Focusing on seagrass habitats, although occupying only 0.2% of the world’s oceans, they can sequestrate up to 10% of the total oceanic carbon pool, all the while providing important food security, biodiversity, and coastal protection. But seagrass ecosystems, as all of their blue carbon seascape neighbors, are losing 1.5% of their extent per year due to anthropogenic activities. This has adverse implications for global carbon stocks, coastal protection, and marine biodiversity. Seagrass and seascape recession necessitates their science and policy-based management, protection, conservation which will ensure that our planet will remain within its sustainable boundaries in the age of climate change. The present PhD Thesis and research aim is to develop algorithms for seagrass mapping and monitoring leveraging the recent emergences in remote sensing technology―new satellite image archives, machine learning frameworks, and cloud computing―with field data from multiple sources. The main PhD findings are the demonstration of the suitability of Sentinel-2, RapidEye, and PlanetScope satellite imagery for regional to large-scale seagrass mapping; the introduction and incorporation of machine learning frameworks in the context of seagrass remote sensing and data analytics; the development of a semi-analytical model to invert the bottom reflectance of seagrasses; the design and implementation of multi-temporal satellite image approaches in coastal aquatic remote sensing; and the introduction, design and application of a scalable cloud-based tool to scale up seagrass mapping across large spatial and temporal dimensions. The approaches of the present PhD cover the gaps of the existing scientific literature of seagrass mapping in terms of the lack of spatial and temporal scalability and adaptability; the infancy in seagrass and seascape-related artificial intelligence endeavours; the restrictions of local server and mono-temporal approaches; and the absence of new methodological developments and applications using new (mainly open) satellite image archives. I anticipate and envisage that the near-future steps after the completion of my PhD will address the scalability of the designed cloud-native, data-driven mapping tool to standardise, automate, commercialise and democratise mapping and monitoring of seagrass and seascape ecosystems globally. The synergy of the developed momentum around the global seascape with the technological potential of Earth Observation can contribute to humanity’s race to adapt to and mitigate the climate change impacts and avoid cross tipping points in climate patterns, and biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Organic carbon stored in coastal vegetated habitats, such as salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses, is defined as blue carbon. The conservation of seagrasses is considered as a nature-based solution to mitigate climate change, and blue carbon assessments may support decision making. This study focuses on mapping and assessing blue carbon storage and sequestration by the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa in the oceanic region of the Canary Islands (eastern Atlantic). Particularly, this study: (1) mapped and assessed the past and current capacity of C. nodosa to store and sequester blue carbon with high spatial resolution (20 m/pixel), (2) mapped and assessed blue carbon under four plausible future scenarios (“No Net Loss”, “Intermediate”, “Business-as-usual” and “Collapse”), and (3) valued the economic implications of these scenarios. The seagrass C. nodosa has suffered ca. 50% area loss in the last two decades, and, if the current degradation rate continues, our estimations demonstrate that it could completely disappear in 2036 (“Collapse”). The impact of these losses in 2050 would reach 1.43 Megatonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted (45% from the current situation) with a cost of 126.3 million € (0.32% of the current Canary GDP). If, however, this degradation is slow down, between 0.11 and 0.57 MT of CO2 equivalent would be emitted until 2050 (“Intermediate” and “Business-as-usual” scenarios, respectively), which corresponds to a social cost of 3.63 and 44.81 million €, respectively. If the decline would be stopped, and the current seagrass extension maintained (“No Net Loss”), 0.75 MT of CO2 equivalent would be sequestered from now to 2050, which corresponds to a social cost saving of 73.59 million €. The main areas and human pressures that need to be tackled were identified to facilitate decision-making. This research proposes, therefore, a methodological strategy with potential applicability across coastal vegetated ecosystems.

AB  - Ongoing work on the ‘blue carbon’ has established that vegetated coastal ecosystems – mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes – are exceptionally powerful natural carbon sinks. Hence, there are important applied arguments for understanding the role of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation. Many gaps in knowledge remain, with seagrasses in particular being poorly understood. The overall aim of the present study was to understand the role of seagrass meadows of Gazi Bay, Kenya as carbon sinks. The specific objectives of the study were: (i) Carry out a comprehensive review on biomass and productivity studies of seagrasses in Africa. (ii) Estimate the carbon storage in the seagrass meadows of the bay (iii) Investigate the impact of seagrass canopy removal on sediment dynamics and on the benthic faunal communities (iv) Investigate productivity of the dominant seagrass species of the bay. (v) Highlight the implication of the knowledge and how it could be useful in the bundling of the ecosystem services of the seagrass meadows with that of adjacent mangrove ecosystem under the payment for ecosystem services (PES). The review work encountered 32 papers and 8 theses/reports on seagrass biomass and productivity at African sites, with the majority of the studies having been done along the E. African coast; however, there were no published reports of sedimentary Corg from Africa, revealing a major gap in knowledge. Results of carbon storage of the seagrass meadows of Gazi, Bay on biomass and sediment organic carbon (Corg) for the four dominant species, Thalassia hemprichii, Thalasodendron ciliatum, Syringodium isoetifolium and Enhalus acoroides, indicated that sediment organic carbon was highly significantly different between species, range: 160.7 – 233.8 Mg C ha-1 compared to the global range of 115.3 to 829.2 Mg C ha-1 . Vegetated areas in all species had significantly higher sediment Corg compared with un-vegetated areas and revealed a surprising degree of spatial consistency and longevity in relatively small patches of seagrass meadows and bare areas thus demonstrating an exceptionally powerful effect of seagrass on C sequestration. Through a seagrass removal experiment that simulated the impact of seagrass loss on biodiversity and ecosystem functions the study recorded positive elevation change of the sediment in the controls and negative elevation in the treatments with significant effect of treatment and time on surface elevation change. Similarly, there were significant weight losses on clod cards in seagrass removed areas compared to the controls, an indication of the role of seagrasses in the reduction of the speed of water current. Carbon density in surface sediment was significantly higher in the control areas as compared to the treatments while higher litter decay rates were observed in seagrass removed areas than in the controls. Seagrass removal areas had significant decline on the fauna. Productivity estimates of the dominant seagrass species of the bay through a combination of the leaf plastochrone, and ingrowth cores, showed inter-species variability with Thalassia hemprichii recording the highest above and below-ground productivity at 188.6±34.8 g DW m-2 yr-1 and 197.4±108.7 g DW m-2 yr-1 respectively. Knowledge on the role of seagrasses of the bay as carbon sinks is likely to open opportunities for bundling seagrass ecosystem services with that of the contiguous mangrove ecosystem as part of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES); an approach that makes economic and ecological sense, given the strong connections between the two ecosystems, and could provide a useful buffer against environmental shocks such as sea level rise and increasing storm surges.

AB  - One of the main consequences of our actions as humans is the ever increasing force of climate change and the many natural disasters that come as a result of it. A major threat to the stability of our cities and societies is that of rising sea level and the resulting coastal flooding. A city that has began to think of solutions is the city of Boston, pushing them to form an initiative known as “Climate Ready Boston”. The issue of both coastal and storm water flooding are highlighted by this initiative and are addressed with a proposed solution. This project explores the use of natural buffer systems as a source of knowledge to be applied to a coastal protection typology. The element of nature chosen to be studied in this thesis is the coral and more specifically, how the form and material of coral reefs are able to mitigate the damages of incoming waves as a result of storm surges. The form and materiality of the coral reefs are translated into a modular coastal protection typology that can be applied on any coast. However, the project places the typology on the coast of Dorchester, MA due to the high level of sea level rise and therefore, flooding events that will occur in the short, middle, and longer terms in the region. The area relies on a resilient harbor front to thrive, due to the saturation of the inland zones by residential areas. As a result, protection of the water front access pathways is crucial since they also align with the flooding inundation pathways. Hence, this project zooms in on one of the inundation pathways and places the typology in that region. The aims of the intervention are to not only mitigate flooding, but to also use the materiality of limestone in order to regrow a coral reef in the longer timescale. This in turn helps achieve the goal of increasing biodiversity. This thesis therefore translates a natural system to protect both humans, as well as promote healthier and protected habitats for the betterment of coastal marine life.

AB  - One of the geographical areas where the effects of climate change manifests itself clearly is the coastal zone. Cities and municipalities on the coastline assume that the current efforts to protect the coast from the impact of climate change in the short and medium term will be sufficient. There is a genuine problem concerning stakeholder awareness and durable partnerships. Apart from the (“imposed”) interventions, additional efforts are limited. The measures are primarily aimed at the “sea side” and implemented as grey infrastructure while measures should also be considered in the corresponding urban littoral area. We note that the need to make more use of climate adaptation, for example (fresh) water storage and retention areas, are rarely included in spatial plans and permits. Climate change is, unfortunately, not seen as an opportunity to progress new urban coastal landscapes and spatial innovations. In each of the ten cities and municipalities on the Flemish coastline (northern part of Belgium), there are ongoing projects on climate change adaptation and innovation. Nature based solutions (NBS) are essential when implementing a sustainable and resilient coastal area. These include hard and soft measures to raise the weakest areas of the coastline to a higher safety level, the possible adaptation of the morphological situation at the seaside, adaptive and robust town scaping. Due to the uniqueness of the urban zone, area-specific tailoring is preferable. These are the key elements of the INTERREG 2Seas project “Sustainable And Resilient Coastal Cities” (SARCC) in which nature based solutions (NBS) are demonstrated.

AB  - On a global scale, most of the coastal zones in the world are undergoing rapid and accelerating changes. This coastal syndrome combines two major trends: one linked to the growth of coastal populations, habitat, transport and industrial infrastructures (assets); the other linked to the influence of climate change and its effects in terms of sea-level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, acidification and increase in ocean surface temperature, both affecting the health of coastal ecosystems. This situation is also reflected in the increase in coastal engineering solutions, which have significant impacts on coastal hydrodynamics and natural ecosystems. This extremely dynamic context calls for an evolution in conservation and spatial planning strategies in order to better anticipate changes that may affect not only the sustainability of both the distribution and health of natural ecosystems, but also the relevance of conservation efforts. Marine and coastal protected areas help preserve ecological services, and reduce the risks faced by coastal communities. Therefore, it can be argued that the effectiveness of these conservation units will depend on the ability, (i) to take into account their territorial context, and also (ii) to base the management decisions on a prospective and sufficiently anticipated (future-oriented) approach. MPA management must be proactive to cope with such rapid changes. The Nexus approach, promoted by the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management - coastal ecosystem group (CEM/CEG), places marine and coastal spatial planning as a key integrative element linking conservation, adaptation to climate change and coastal risk reduction, and as a part of no-regret adaptation strategies. This paper highlights the main factors that characterize current coastal dynamics, and then briefly presents three future-oriented pilot operations, implemented in Western Africa at different scales. These operations illustrate how MPAs must become structuring elements for the organization and development of coastal territories if they are to contribute to the resilience of coastal systems and to ensure their own long-term sustainability.

AB  - On 10 September 2019 the Global Commission on Adaptation launched its Flagship report to accelerate adaptation by elevating the political visibility of adaptation and focusing on concrete solutions. In the report, the GCA has exemplified nature-based solutions, such as those pioneered in Indonesia, as an effective way of adapting to the impacts of climate change. The Global Commission on Adaptation is led by Ban Ki-moon, 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations, Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Kristalina Georgieva, CEO, World Bank. The flagship report highlights the Building with Nature initiative in Indonesia (Case study 4: Participatory Planning in Indonesia, page 33) as an example of participatory planning to reduce coastal erosion along its degraded mangrove coasts. Building with Nature involves an inclusive planning process comprising hydrologists, ecologists and engineers working jointly with local communities and government stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions that meet local needs. The approach integrates infrastructure design with the restoration of ecosystems that add value through coastal protection, flood regulation, as well as boosting fisheries, recreation and biodiversity. Building with nature solutions are more sustainable and adaptive than conventional infrastructure, typically cheaper to construct and maintain while enabling more productive and multi-functional land-use. As such the approach meets the triple dividend criteria as emphasised in GCA’s flagship report: avoided losses, positive economic gains and social and environmental benefits. The approach has the potential to become the dominant approach to tackle water challenges − sought by governments, cities, ports − and supported by planners and investors. In many vulnerable settings nature based solutions are the only possible way forward. As emphasised in the Flagship report, with the growing threat of climate change and hazards from the loss of wetlands and other ecosystems, it is vital we scale up these necessary adaptation measures as soon as possible. Indonesia which has taken leadership on Building with Nature in Indonesia since 2012 has therefore voiced its ambition to share their knowledge and experiences on Building with Nature with other countries in Asia which are also ranked highly vulnerable to impacts from climate change. In Indonesia a small scale experiment to reduce coastal erosion in Java has today grown into landscape scale implementation to increase protection from coastal flooding for 70,000 people through natural mangrove recovery and sustainable aquaculture. The approach has meanwhile been replicated in 14 districts and there may also be spin-off of Building with Nature approaches in adaptation plans of adjacent Semarang city. The Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, India, China have already expressed a keen interest in such collaboration on Building with Nature between countries and they have identified tangible opportunities for implementation at scale in different types of landscapes. This was voiced during an event in July 2019 organised by Indonesia, the Global Centre for Adaptation, EcoShape, Wetlands International and Deltares on ‘Accelerating Adaptation through Building with Nature in Asia’. The event convened a group of experts and representatives from Asia and the Netherlands along with international donors, financiers and private sector to stimulate proper investment, learning by doing and regional multisectoral collaboration on Building with Nature in the region. The joint ambition is to link Building with Nature in Asia to the GCA’s Action Track on Nature based Solutions which will mobilize national, local, and private sector leadership for nature-based solutions.

AB  - Offering remarkable biodiversity, coastal salt marshes also provide a wide variety of ecosystem services: cultural services (leisure, tourist amenities), supply services (crop production, pastoralism) and regulation services including carbon sequestration and natural protection against coastal erosion and inundation. The consideration of this coastal protection ecosystem service takes part in a renewed vision of coastal risk management and especially marine flooding, with an emerging focus on “nature-based solutions.” Through this work, using remote-sensing methods, we propose a novel drone-based spatial modeling methodology of the salt marsh hydrodynamic attenuation at very high spatial resolution (VHSR). This indirect modeling is based on in situ measurements of significant wave heights (Hm0) that constitute the ground truth, as well as spectral and topographical predictors from VHSR multispectral drone imagery. By using simple and multiple linear regressions, we identify the contribution of predictors, taken individually, and jointly. The best individual drone-based predictor is the green waveband. Dealing with the addition of individual predictors to the red-green-blue (RGB) model, the highest gain is observed with the red edge waveband, followed by the near-infrared, then the digital surface model. The best full combination is the RGB enhanced by the red edge and the normalized difference vegetation index (coefficient of determination (R2): 0.85, root mean square error (RMSE): 0.20%/m).

AB  - Oceans are an important source of wealth, at least 3 to 5 percent of global GDP is derived from the oceans, but their overall health is reaching a tipping point. Close to a third of fish stocks are fully fished or overfished, climate change is impacting coastal and marine ecosystems through a variety of vectors, unbridled development in the coastal zone is causing erosion, widespread desalination in semi enclosed seas is threatening fauna and flora alike, and marine pollution, particularly from land-based sources is reaching such a proportion that its impacts cannot even be accurately measured. The role of healthy oceans in stabilizing climate and keeping the planet cool is now better understood, and increasingly given the prominence and visibility it deserves in the global action arena. It is also known that business as usual in the different economic sectors associated with coastal and marine ecosystems will have great environmental and social impacts, which are expected to disproportionally affect vulnerable groups of the population, particularly women and girls. This is reflected in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 - Life Below Water, which calls to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. In this context, the concept of the Blue Economy is particularly relevant and applicable to STP. Different institutions have different definitions of the Blue Economy, which is understood by the Bank as the sustainable and integrated development of oceanic sectors in healthy oceans. There is growing recognition that overfishing, marine pollution, and coastal erosion, among other issues, are pushing oceans to a tipping point to the detriment of the millions who depend on healthy oceans for jobs, nutrition, economic growth, and climate regulation. Central to the Blue Economy approach is the recognition that social benefits should be maximized over the long-term, ensuring that the economic drivers that result from the sustainable use of ocean resources are maintained.

AB  - Ocean Cities are where landscapes and seascapes meet, where human behaviour and urban development have a profound impact on marine health and climate change. Marine and coastal ecosystems are the largest carbon sink in the world and a vital source of livelihood, employment, nutrition and economic growth in cities and islands. Yet, the capacity of these ecosystems to balance our climate, protect our coastlines, and sustain human development is acutely threatened. Marine pollution and urban run-off, unsustainable coastal development and poor marine governance, rising sea levels, ocean warming and acidification endanger the health of our ocean and erode the very foundation Ocean Cities are built on. For Pacific island settlements, the nexus between urban development, climate change and the ocean is of critical importance since most island communities are coastal, with some smaller island and atoll nations under five meters of elevation. Together with their regional partners, Ocean Cities of the Pacific islands can pioneer ocean-focused, climate resilient solutions for sustainable development. Recognizing and understanding the interconnections and interdependent futures between cities and the ocean will catalyse integrated responses to increase resilience, protect ecosystems, and meet the challenges of rapidly urbanizing island societies. This policy brief outlines the challenges of unplanned rapid urban expansion and deteriorating ocean health, urban resilience and climate impacts on Ocean Cities. Associated opportunities for ocean friendly climate responsive urban development in Pacific islands are discussed in policy briefs two and three of this series. Even if global warming is limited to 2°C, sea levels could continue to rise by over 5 meters over the following centuries, posing a serious threat to low-lying Ocean Cities of the Pacific islands as most urban areas are located ≤5 meters above sea level.

AB  - Ocean and cryosphere changes already impact Low-Lying Islands and Coasts (LLIC), including Small Island Developing States (SIDS), with cascading and compounding risks. Disproportionately higher risks are expected in the course of the 21st century. Reinforcing the findings of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, vulnerable human communities, especially those in coral reef environments and polar regions, may exceed adaptation limits well before the end of this century and even in a low greenhouse gas emission pathway (high confidence1). Depending on the effectiveness of 21st century mitigation and adaptation pathways under all emission scenarios, most of the low-lying regions around the world may face adaptation limits beyond 2100, due to the long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium confidence). LLIC host around 11% of the global population, generate about 14% of the global Gross Domestic Product and comprise many world cultural heritage sites. LLIC already experience climate-related ocean and cryosphere changes (high confidence), and they share both commonalities in their exposure and vulnerability to climate change (e.g., low elevation, human disturbances to terrestrial and marine ecosystems), and context-specificities (e.g., variable ecosystem climate sensitivities and risk perceptions by populations). Options to adapt to rising seas, e.g., range from hard engineering to ecosystem-based measures, and from securing current settings to relocating people, built assets and activities. Effective combinations of measures vary across geographies (cities and megacities, small islands, deltas and Arctic coasts), and reflect the scale of observed and projected impacts, ecosystems’ and societies’ adaptive capacity, and the existence of transformational governance (high confidence). In this Report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence.

AB  - Ocean acidification is a substantial emergent threat to marine biodiversity and the goods and services it provides. Although efforts to address ocean acidification have been taken under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a far greater potential to do so exists by finding synergies between biodiversity conservation efforts and ocean acidification action. The ongoing process to develop a post-2020 global biodiversity framework offers an opportunity to ensure that opportunities for addressing ocean acidification are capitalized on and not overlooked. I argue that to achieve this, the following are needed: a technical integration of ocean acidification across the targets to be included in the post-2020 framework and a reframing of the issue as a biodiversity problem so as to highlight the synergies between existing biodiversity work and action needed to address ocean acidification. Given that the post-2020 framework is intended to establish the global biodiversity agenda for the coming decades, integration of ocean acidification will set a precedent for the other biodiversity-related conventions and encourage greater uptake of the issue across the wider international community. My approach is of direct relevance to those participating in the negotiations, both from a CBD Party perspective and the perspective of those advocating for a strong outcome to protect marine biodiversity and marine socioecological systems. My discussion of framing is relevant to those working beyond the CBD within other biodiversity-related conventions in which goals to address ocean acidification are sorely lacking.

AB  - O‘ahu, Hawai‘i’s coastal hazards include accelerating erosion, sea level rise, and coastal storms that threaten to flood roadways and new rail infrastructure. Typical “hard” shoreline armoring for coastal protection results in detrimental erosion; this report presents alternatives, such as living shorelines and green infrastructure. When planning long term infrastructure for 3.2 feet of sea level rise by mid-century, the goal of living shorelines is to slow coastal erosion and reduce flooding so that coastal transportation ways may remain operational during the coming decades. This primer provides a literature review, project precedents, and design ideas for living shorelines and green infrastructure at three coastal sites on O‘ahu. The study sites, analysis, and design methods serve as prototypes for high, medium, and low wave energy sites for reference by policy makers and future design teams. The study site locations on O‘ahu are Sunset Beach, Waikiki Beach, and Waipahu Transit Oriented Development Area. At each site, potential living shorelines and green infrastructure strategies are evaluated based on the strategies’ function and effectiveness, quantitatively where possible. The international project precedents include built and unbuilt living shorelines and green infrastructure projects, often emphasizing their multiple uses and shared benefits. The design ideas at each study site integrate the potential living shoreline and green infrastructure strategies at a conceptual design level, communicated through drawings and physical models. The primer also demonstrates how student learning and multi-disciplinary collaboration enhance applied research.

AB  - Numerical modeling efforts in support of restoration and protection activities in coastal Louisiana have traditionally been conducted externally to any stakeholder engagement processes. This separation has resulted in planning- and project-level models built solely on technical observation and analysis of natural processes. Despite its scientific rigor, this process often fails to account for the knowledge, values, and experiences of local stakeholders that often contextualizes a modeled system. To bridge this gap, a team of natural and social scientists worked directly with local residents and resource users to develop a participatory modeling approach to collect and utilize local knowledge about the Breton Sound Estuary in southeast Louisiana, USA. Knowledge capture was facilitated through application of a local knowledge mapping methodology designed to catalog local understanding of current and historical conditions within the estuary and identify desired ecological and hydrologic end states. The results of the mapping endeavor informed modeling activities designed to assess the applicability of the identified restoration solutions. This effort was aimed at increasing stakeholder buy-in surrounding the utility of numerical models for planning and designing coastal protection and restoration projects and included an ancillary outcome aimed at elevating stakeholder empowerment regarding the design of nature-based restoration solutions and modeling scenarios. This intersection of traditional science and modeling activities with the collection and analysis of traditional ecological knowledge proved useful in elevating the confidence that community members had in modeled restoration outcomes.

AB  - New York City’s coastlines are a mosaic of natural and man-made habitats intermixed with housing and industry, all of which are extremely vulnerable to flooding, storm surge, and damaging wave action. Risks are projected to increase over time as sea levels rise, population grows, and the frequency and severity of extreme events increase. This paper investigates the potential role of green infrastructure (GI) as a risk reduction measure, using Hurricane Sandy as a case study. Specifically, this research examines whether the type, size, and configuration of GI played a role in determining the odds of building damages. Results suggest that proximity to different GI types did affect the odds of damage, both positively and negatively, and that the impacts of both small-scale and large-scale natural features varied geographically. Results suggest that nature-based solutions to coastal flooding must be tailored to specific local conditions in order to be effective.

AB  - New flume experiments with surrogate seagrass meadows are presented. The experiments included the creation of a full-scale and realistic Posidonia Oceanica model to evaluate the effect over wave attenuation, sediment transport and shoreline erosion. A hydrodynamic and morphodynamic comparison between cases with seagrass and without seagrass for two wave energy conditions was performed. Meadow density and submergence ratio were constant for tests under irregular waves. The wave height reduction, bar crest location, total sediment transport and shoreline position were used to evaluate the coastal protection efficiency of the meadow. The measured wave heights suffered a reduction due to the presence of the seagrass. These reductions were persistent in the area located between the onshore edge of the meadow and the depth of closure, being of greater magnitude in the more energetic case. All tests showed the development of a bar and the migration of the crest offshore over time. However, the dissipation of the incoming wave energy on the meadow made the bar crest stay closer to the shoreline and consequently generated a lower freeboard. In addition, the bar migration rate was reduced by the simulated meadow effect, in particular in the lower energetic case. A sediment volume significantly smaller was transported offshore when the seagrass meadow was present in both wave conditions. Additionally, in the higher energy case, a smaller shoreline retreat was observed when the meadow was present.

AB  - Nature‐based solutions (NbSs) have long recognized the value of coastal and marine ecosystem management and associated ecosystem services as useful tools for climate change mitigation (e.g., blue carbon) and adaptation (e.g., coastal protection against flooding and storm surges). However, NbSs remain poorly acknowledged and mostly absent from coastal planning for disasterrisk reduction policies in the Caribbean, as well as from ex‐post disaster reconstruction funds. With the increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the region, NbSs are now more needed than ever. Taking Mexico as a representative case study for the wider Caribbean, we here seek to identify and analyze the barriers and opportunities perceived by relevant stakeholders for mainstreaming coastal‐marine NbSs into coastal management and disaster risk reduction policies (e.g., mangroves as green infrastructure) to protect coastal societies and national economies against hurricanes. We conduct semi‐structured, in‐depth interviews with twenty stakeholders covering academic, governmental, tourism, NGO, coastal planning, and financial domains. Among the twenty‐three identified barriers, governance, institutional, financial, and human‐capacity aspects are the most dominant perceptions behind the current lack of NbS implementation. Future action for the policy integration of NbSs requires widespread political will and better quantification of both the provision of ecosystem services and their economic benefits under conventional markets.

AB  - Nature‐Based Solutions (NBS) are solutions to societal challenges that are inspired and supported by nature. The European Commission requested the EKLIPSE project to help building up an evidence and knowledge base on the benefits and challenges of applying NBS. In response to the request, the EKLIPSE Expert Working Group on Nature‐based Solutions to Promote Climate Resilience in Urban Areas (EWG) devised the following objectives: 1) To develop an impact evaluation framework with a list of criteria for assessing the performance of NBS in dealing with challenges related to climate resilience in urban areas; 2) To prepare an application guide for measuring how NBS projects fare against the identified indicators in delivering multiple environmental, economic and societal benefits; 3) To make recommendations to improve the assessment of the effectiveness of NBS projects, including the identification of knowledge gaps according to the criteria presented in the impact evaluation framework. This document reports on these three objectives. It is intended to be used as a reference document by members of current and future European projects with an interest in NBS in urban areas, and by practitioners seeking to compare the effectiveness of NBS design, implementation and evaluation. The EWG recognises that the type and intensity of NBS impacts may vary according to the characteristics of the NBS and the context in which they are applied. The intent of this report is not to define NBS, but rather provide examples of indicators and methods for assessing impacts of NBS that may be applied in a range of different ways across urban areas in Europe. As such, the report also identifies the scale at which the indicators are relevant, to guide an assessment of impacts.

AB  - Nature-based strategies, such as wave attenuation by tidal marshes, are increasingly proposed as a complement to mitigate the risks of failure of engineered flood defense structures such as levees. However, recent analysis of historic coastal storms revealed smaller dike breach dimensions if there were natural, high tidal marshes in front of the dikes. Since tidal marshes naturally only experience weak flow velocities (~0-0.3 ms-1 during normal spring tides), we lack direct observations on the stability of tidal marsh sediments and vegetation under extreme flow velocities (order of several ms-1) as may occur when a dike behind a marsh breaches. As a first approximation, the stability of a tidal marsh sediment bed and winter-state vegetation under high flow velocities were tested in a flume. Marsh monoliths were excavated from Phragmites australis marshes in front of a dike along the Scheldt estuary (Dutch-Belgian border area) and installed in a 10 m long flume test section. Both sediment bed and vegetation responses were quantified over 6 experimental runs under high flow velocities up to 1.75 ms-1 and water depth up to 0.35 m for 2 hours. These tests showed that even after a cumulative 12 hours exposure to high flow velocities, erosion was limited to as little as a few millimeters. Manual removal of the aboveground vegetation did not enhance the erosion either. Present findings may be related to the strongly consolidated, clay- and silt-rich sediment and P. australis root system in this experiment. During the flow exposure, the P. australis stems were strongly bent by the water flow, but the majority of all shoots recovered rapidly when the flow had stopped. Although present results may not be blindly extrapolated to all other marsh types, they do provide a strong first indication that marshes can remain stable under high flow conditions, and confirm the potential of well-developed tidal marshes as a valuable extra natural barrier reducing flood discharges towards the hinterland, following a dike breach. These outcomes promote the consideration to implement tidal marshes as part of the overall flood defense and to rethink dike strengthening in the future.

AB  - Nature-based solutions, such as living shorelines, have the potential to restore critical ecosystems, enhance coastal sustainability, and increase resilience to natural disasters; however, their efficacy during storm events compared to traditional hardened shorelines is largely untested. This is a major impediment to their implementation and promotion to policy-makers and homeowners. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated rock sill living shorelines as compared to natural marshes and hardened shorelines (i.e., bulkheads) in North Carolina, USA for changes in surface elevation, Spartina alterniflora stem density, and structural damage from 2015 to 2017, including before and after Hurricane Matthew (2016). Our results show that living shorelines exhibited better resistance to landward erosion during Hurricane Matthew than bulkheads and natural marshes. Additionally, living shorelines were more resilient than hardened shorelines, as they maintained landward elevation over the two-year study period without requiring any repair. Finally, rock sill living shorelines were able to enhance S. alterniflora stem densities over time when compared to natural marshes. Our results suggest that living shorelines have the potential to improve coastal resilience while supporting important coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Nature-based solutions to mitigate the impact of future climate change depend on restoring biological diversity and natural processes. Coastal foredunes represent the most important natural flood barriers along coastlines worldwide, but their area has been squeezed dramatically because of a continuing urbanisation of coastlines, especially in Europe. Dune development is steered by the development of vegetation in interaction with sand fluxes from the beach. Marram grass (Calamagrostis arenaria, formerly Ammophila arenaria) is the main dune building species along most European coasts, but also in other continents where the species was introduced. Engineering of coastal dunes, for instance by building dunes in front of dikes, needs to be based on a solid understanding of the species’ interactions with the environment. Only quantitative approaches enable the further development of mechanistic models and coastal management strategies that encapsulate these biomorphogenic interactions. We here provide a quantitative review of the main biotic and physical interactions that affect marram grass performance, their interactions with sand fluxes and how they eventually shape dune development. Our review highlights that the species’ spatial organisation is central to dune development. We further demonstrate this importance by means of remote sensing and a mechanistic model and provide an outlook for further research on the use of coastal dunes as a nature-based solution for coastal protection.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions that combine salt marshes with traditional coastal protection structures are gaining popularity in the face of ongoing climate change. Vegetation establishment is of major importance herein as it facilitates salt marsh growth in lateral and vertical direction. However, the effects of marshsupporting management measures (e.g. brushwood dams) on the establishment of pioneer vegetation on salt marshes are still understudied. To that end, this study quantifies hydrodynamic and morphodynamic thresholds for vegetation establishment based on observations from a constructed salt marsh. Bed level changes, inundation, and vegetation characteristics of the dominant pioneer species Salicornia were monitored during growing season 2021. Subsequently, the existing hydromorphodynamic DET-ESTMORF model was extended with the ability to predict vegetation establishment based on these thresholds. This extended model was then used to predict pioneer vegetation establishment on the short-term under different dam heights and on the long-term under expected sea level rise the coming 80 years. Increased dam height does not result in a significant increase in vegetation establishment. Sea level rise caused the vegetation boundary to retreat landward each decade until almost no vegetation was present anymore in the year 2100. The extended DET-ESTMORF model can hence be used to simulate the effects of different management measures on vegetation establishment on a constructed salt marsh.

AB  - Nature-based solutions represent a critical concept that harnesses natural systems to provide essential services for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. As a nature-based solution, blue-green infrastructure takes advantage of nature’s innate ability to substitute for or strengthen infrastructure systems by preserving, enhancing, or restoring a natural system's elements to build high quality, resilient and lower-cost infrastructure. The chapter describes how ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction, ecosystem-based adaptation, and blue-green infrastructure are implemented in the Philippines, including the policies that support them, the status of implementation, and through a case study in Polillo, Quezon, Philippines. Findings show that despite policies in place to support and advance the mainstreaming of nature-based solutions in the country, the environment's cross-cutting nature as a sector makes enforcement and implementation of programs, plans, and activities extremely challenging. Implementing nature-based solutions in the Philippines has so far been undertaken as a response to environmental challenges. More than being reactive, a proactive focus on nature-based solutions for prevention, mitigation, and rehabilitation is needed. The science and evidence for blue-green infrastructure would need to be strengthened to inform decision-making better, gain political commitment at all levels, secure funding and private sector engagement, and ultimately advance its implementation.

AB  - Nature-based solutions attract more and more interest due to increasing maintenance costs of grey infrastructure, increasing design conditions and growing environmental awareness. Integrating ecosystems in coastal engineering practice not only scores with societal and ecological benefits, such as biodiversity and cultural services, but also provides coastal protection services by attenuating waves and stabilizing sediments. Although nature-based solutions can already be found along many coasts around the globe, coastal engineers are still posed to challenges when evaluating, designing, implementing or maintaining nature-based solutions as guidance and in-depth investigations on efficiency, vulnerabilities and natural dynamics are often lacking. Current challenges for science and practice relate to the general requirements of nature-based solutions, the determination of fundamental data and insecurities and knowledge gaps. To overcome these challenges, close collaboration of engineers and ecologists is necessary.

AB  - Nature-based solutions are rapidly gaining interest in the face of global change and increasing flood risks. While assessments of flood risk mitigation by coastal ecosystems are mainly restricted to local scales, our study assesses the contribution of salt marshes and mangroves to nature-based storm surge mitigation in 11 large deltas around the world. We present a relatively simple GIS model that, based on globally available input data, provides an estimation of the tidal wetland’s capacity of risk mitigation at a regional scale. It shows the high potential of nature-based solutions, as tidal wetlands, to provide storm surge mitigation to more than 80% of the flood-exposed land area for 4 of the 11 deltas and to more than 70% of the flood-exposed population for 3 deltas. The magnitude of the nature-based mitigation, estimated as the length of the storm surge pathway crossing through tidal wetlands, was found to be significantly correlated to the total wetland area within a delta. This highlights the importance of conserving extensive continuous tidal wetlands as a nature-based approach to mitigate flood risks. Our analysis further reveals that deltas with limited historical wetland reclamation and therefore large remaining wetlands, such as the Mississippi, the Niger, and part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra deltas, benefit from investing in the conservation of their vast wetlands, while deltas with extensive historical wetland reclamation, such as the Yangtze and Rhine deltas, may improve the sustainability of flood protection programs by combining existing hard engineering with new nature-based solutions through restoration of former wetlands.

AB  - Nature-based solutions are increasingly suggested for mitigating coastal flood risks in the face of climate change. Managed realignment (MR), a coastal adaptation strategy that entails the landward realignment of coastal defences to restore coastal habitats (often salt marshes), plays a pivotal role in implementing nature-based solutions in the coastal zone. Across Europe, more than 130 sites have been implemented so far, often to harness their potential to mitigate coastal flood risks while restoring coastal habitats (ABPmer, 2021). However, local communities often oppose MR projects, not only because they are seen as returning hard-won land to the sea but also because their coastal protection function is less trusted than traditional hard engineering techniques. This scepticism has foundation. The proclaimed coastal protection function of MRs is based on a broad body of literature on the protective function of natural salt marshes. However, contrary to natural salt marshes, MRs are often semi-enclosed tidal basins with narrow breaches to the open sea/estuary. Recent studies indicate that MR-internal hydrodynamics may significantly reduce their coastal protection, depending on their engineering design. To successfully implement MR, a much-improved scientific knowledge base is needed, as well as a process for addressing community concerns and genuinely engaging stakeholders in decision-making beyond the usual obligatory consultancy approach. Here, we propose the co-production of scientific knowledge with local communities and stakeholders to optimize the success of coastal nature-based solutions and promote community acceptance.

AB  - Nature-Based Solutions (NbS), a concept introduced in the late 2000s, has developed rapidly during the last years and is now frequently appearing in a broad spectrum of policies developed within the European Union. Its role in marine policies and research programmes is however still limited, but is likely to increase as NbS are adopted as key terminology in both biodiversity strategies and the EU taxonomy for sustainable financing. This will enhance the need for scientific advisory institutions to provide evidence-based advice on potential impacts of various combinations of marine NbS. To facilitate a critical debate about the prospects and pitfalls related to the operationalisation of marine NbS in an EU context, this paper provides an analysis of core definitions, potential categories of marine NBS and a suite of case studies. Coastal waters, shelf and open oceans present multiple options for testing new and scaling up known NbS, which could support both environmental restoration simultaneously with addressing multiple societal challenges, paving the way for a new level of ecosystem-based management. However, as the acceptance of NbS types will depend on ecosystem state and thus history, it will be a significant task to consistently communicate why some solutions may count as a NbS in some areas, while not in others. To conclude, the paper therefore raises a set of research priorities and policy advice aimed at ensuring the successful advice and deployment of marine NBS in support of multiple societal goals.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to climate- and development-related challenges have recently gained attention in development cooperation. This Working Paper focuses on nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation, also known as Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). It provides an overview of selected lessons learnt from EbA in the context of development cooperation, with a particular emphasis on the opportunities and risks regarding poverty alleviation and rights. This Working Paper is based on a desk study of selected academic literature and policy- and project-related publications and reports. It has been prepared by DIIS as part of the project 'Research and Evaluation of Development Cooperation' with funding from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Working Paper seeks to generate learning for Danish development cooperation, including future programming under Denmark's 2021 development strategy, in which NbS approaches are emphasised. However, the paper can also be read as a general discussion of experiences with EbA in the development context.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) to climate change currently have considerable political traction. However, national intentions to deploy NbS have yet to be fully translated into evidence-based targets and action on the ground. To enable NbS policy and practice to be better informed by science, we produced the first global systematic map of evidence on the effectiveness of nature-based interventions for addressing the impacts of climate change and hydrometeorological hazards on people. Most of the interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems were reported to have ameliorated adverse climate impacts. Conversely, interventions involving created ecosystems (e.g., afforestation) were associated with trade-offs; such studies primarily reported reduced soil erosion or increased vegetation cover but lower water availability, although this evidence was geographically restricted. Overall, studies reported more synergies than trade-offs between reduced climate impacts and broader ecological, social, and climate change mitigation outcomes. In addition, nature-based interventions were most often shown to be as effective or more so than alternative interventions for addressing climate impacts. However, there were substantial gaps in the evidence base. Notably, there were few studies of the cost-effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and few integrated assessments considering broader social and ecological outcomes. There was also a bias in evidence toward the Global North, despite communities in the Global South being generally more vulnerable to climate impacts. To build resilience to climate change worldwide, it is imperative that we protect and harness the benefits that nature can provide, which can only be done effectively if informed by a strengthened evidence base.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) to climate change and other environmental challenges face a well-documented shortfall in financing and resource allocation. Economic evaluations of NBS that apply stated preference methods increasingly use time contributions instead of the traditionally used monetary contributions, especially in developing countries. These studies have focused on measuring the benefits of NBS and have not investigated the potential of freely provided community time contributions to reduce the financial needs of NBS. In this paper we investigate this potential through a systematic literature review and an analysis of four datasets from case studies in Ghana and Vietnam that apply similar questionnaires and discrete choice experiments with time contributions. We study a range of (de)motivating factors to contributing time to NBS and provide examples on the extent to which time contributions could reduce financial needs of NBS in developing countries. The results indicate that time contributions from households for the implementation and maintenance of NBS are motivated by social capital and coping appraisal. Time contribution schemes are therefore more likely to succeed in communities where social capital and coping appraisal are high and could be increased or maintained over time through the preservation and fostering of both these factors. The analysis also reveals that implementing time contributions would in general not lead to the exclusion of specific socio-demographic groups in society, such as lower income households. Finally, using two specific projects in Vietnam as examples, we calculate that time contributions can reduce 29% and 44% of the financial needs of NBS by covering the projects’ labour requirements. These results are of high importance to those working on NBS financing, awareness and behavior change campaigns, and practitioners that apply stated preference methods in developing countries.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) provide a promising means to a climate resilient future. To guide investments in NBS, stated preference (SP) studies have become a common tool to evaluate the benefits of NBS in developing countries. Due to subsistence lifestyles and generally lower incomes, SP studies in developing countries increasingly use time payments as an alternative to the traditionally implemented money payments. It remains unclear, however, how time values should be converted into money values, how the payment affects willingness to pay (WTP) estimates, and how this influence varies across settings with different levels of market integration. We compare the results of choice experiments that use either time or money payments and that are implemented in urban and rural Ghana. The choice experiments target to value different NBS aimed at erosion prevention and other ecosystem service benefits along the highly erosion prone Ghanaian coastline. Time payments are converted into monetary units using two generic wage-based conversion rates and one novel individual-specific non-wage-based conversion rate. We find higher WTP estimates for the time payments. Moreover, we find that the underlying implicit assumptions related to the currently commonly applied generic wage-based conversion rates do not hold. Finally, we find higher levels of market integration and smaller WTP disparities in the urban site, providing evidence that market integration allows for convergence of WTP estimates. These results provide guidance on the accurate estimation of NBS benefits through the implementation of stated preference studies with time payments.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) is the latest contribution to the green concept family. NBS is defined as actions based in nature addressing societal challenges. In this study, we lean on the concept boundary object, broken down into three analytical categories: use, core ideas and granularities, to explore the cohesive and fragmenting powers of the NBS concept, and discuss its future role in green space governance. The study is based on a structured, qualitative review of 112 scientific peer-reviewed publications that use the term NBS. Most publications are from 2017 or later, highlighting the novelty of the NBS concept. The concept has a strong footing in the European urban context. Flood mitigation and functional ecosystems and biodiversity conservation are the most targeted sustainability goals in the publications, and a diversity of solutions are considered. There is a close link between the NBS concept, green infrastructure, and the ecosystem service concept, indicating a path dependency in its uptake and use. The publications demonstrate a low level of integration of the NBS concept (i.e. it is commonly used as a buzz word). Most empirical studies focus solely on environmental benefits delivered by NBS, and few studies assess social, economic, and environmental benefits together, which is a central ambition of the concept. We conclude that the NBS concept is working on the boundaries between different scientific disciplines and between science and policy. Depending on how the research community deals with identified temporal, epistemological and ontological granularities, we conclude that the concept has three potential developmental pathways; broader and deeper, biased with stickiness to older green concepts and an empty buzz word.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have been advocated to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The uptake of NbS differs regionally with some countries exhibiting greater uptake than others. The success of NbS also differs regionally with varying environmental conditions and social-ecological processes. In many regions, the body of knowledge, particularly around the efficacy of such efforts, remains fragmented. Having an “inventory” or “tool box” of regionally-trialed methods, outcomes and lessons learnt can improve the evidence base, inform adaptive management, and ultimately support the uptake of NbS. Using Malaysia as a case study, we provide a comprehensive overview of trialed and tested NbS efforts that used nature to address societal challenges in marine and coastal environments (here referring to mangroves, seagrass, coral reefs), and detailed these efforts according to their objectives, as well as their anticipated and actual outcomes. The NbS efforts were categorised according to the IUCN NbS approach typology and mapped to provide a spatial overview of IUCN NbS effort types. A total of 229 NbS efforts were collated, representing various levels of implementation success. From the assessment of these efforts, several key actions were identified as a way forward to enhance the uptake of Nature-based Solutions for informing coastal sustainable development policy and planning. These include increasing education, training, and knowledge sharing,; rationalizing cooperation across jurisdictions, laws, and regulations; enhancing environmental monitoring; leveraging on existing policies; enabling collaboration and communication; and implementing sustainable finance instruments. These findings can be used to inform the improved application and uptake of NbS, globally.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) for hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs) reduction and management are becoming increasingly popular, but challenges such as the lack of well-recognised standard methodologies to evaluate their performance and upscale their implementation remain. We systematically evaluate the current state-of-the art on the models and tools that are utilised for the optimum allocation, design and efficiency evaluation of NBS for five HMRs (flooding, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion). We found that methods to assess the complex issue of NBS efficiency and cost-benefits analysis are still in the development stage and they have only been implemented through the methodologies developed for other purposes such as fluid dynamics models in micro and catchment scale contexts. Of the reviewed numerical models and tools MIKE-SHE, SWMM (for floods), ParFlow-TREES, ACRU, SIMGRO (for droughts), WRF, ENVI-met (for heatwaves), FUNWAVE-TVD, BROOK90 (for landslides), TELEMAC and ADCIRC (for storm surges) are more flexible to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of specific NBS such as wetlands, ponds, trees, parks, grass, green roof/walls, tree roots, vegetations, coral reefs, mangroves, sea grasses, oyster reefs, sea salt marshes, sandy beaches and dunes. We conclude that the models and tools that are capable of assessing the multiple benefits, particularly the performance and cost-effectiveness of NBS for HMR reduction and management are not readily available. Thus, our synthesis of modelling methods can facilitate their selection that can maximise opportunities and refute the current political hesitation of NBS deployment compared with grey solutions for HMR management but also for the provision of a wide range of social and economic co-benefits. However, there is still a need for bespoke modelling tools that can holistically assess the various components of NBS from an HMR reduction and management perspective. Such tools can facilitate impact assessment modelling under different NBS scenarios to build a solid evidence base for upscaling and replicating the implementation of NBS.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) build synergies between biodiversity conservation and societal challenges such as climate change. This paper derives a working definition of NbS based on an evaluation of existing definitions, in particular the IUCN (2016) definition. It comprises the key elements of the existing definitions that we believe to be important to inform the scope of this study. It critically assesses the global mitigation potential of NbS in relevant studies for forests, croplands, grasslands, terrestrial and coastal wetlands as well as settlements. Recommendations for international climate policy are derived. The study finds that it is likely that NbS potentials provided by scientific literature overestimate the realistic potential of NbS for climate change mitigation. This is due to a lack of integrated studies, overly optimistic assumptions on land availability as well as the quality of available information. Furthermore, the influence of measures on GHG fluxes, uncertainties related to carbon fluxes and quantification methodologies as well as climate impacts are not taken into account. The majority of studies evaluating the mitigation potential of NbS focus on the technical mitigation potential. General ecological constraints such as existing threats to ecosystems, and biodiversity impacts, land use conflicts and other social, cultural and political barriers as well as the risk of non-permanence further limit mitigation potentials. The success of NbS to mitigate climate change and deliver ecological and social co-benefits will very much depend on eliminating direct and indirect pressures on ecosystems caused by current patterns of production and consumption. Nevertheless, the uncertainties related to the quantification of mitigation effects of NbS should not be used as an argument against their implementation. Neither should they be used as an excuse to delay ambitious mitigation action to reduce emissions. In the UNFCCC negotiation process, information on NbS in biennial transparency reports may serve as a basis for technical discussion to improve methodologies and indicators to assess how NbS contribute to achieving NDCs and to make further financial support available. In implementing activities under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the specific risks related to NbS must be taken into account. In the development of processes or support schemes to foster NbS, social and environmental safeguards need to be put in place. Coherence with work under other international policy frameworks such as the other Rio Conventions is required to foster synergies.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are ways to tackle climate change while at the same time strengthening biodiversity and delivering ecosystem services to humans. The Nordic region aims to become the most sustainable in the world by 2030. That is why The Nordic Council of Ministers launched a research programme running from 2021-24, encouraging the Nordic countries to work together and enhance the knowledge base on nature-based solutions, restoration, climate mitigation and blue-green infrastructure. S-ITUATION is the first of five projects under this programme. The project report aims to synthesize and present existing research on NBS relevant in the Nordic context, including relevant projects and experiences, policies, knowledge gaps and cost-benefit analyses.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are promising strategies for protecting vulnerable coasts in the context of climate change, utilizing the coastal protection capabilities of natural ecosystems for engineering applications. The ability of coastal marsh vegetation to attenuate wave energy and prevent coastal erosion has been acknowledged for decades, however, consideration for their use in coastal protection strategies is presently limited, particularly in Canada due to a lack of engineering guidelines and limited available research considering region-specific variables. Physical modelling presents a useful tool for investigating the coastal protection function provided by marsh vegetation in a controlled, repeatable environment, which can ultimately inform the design of nature-based coastal protection strategies. To date, such studies have investigated the influence of plant biophysical parameters (stem flexibility, width, and height) and hydrodynamic conditions (wave height, wave period, and plant submergence) on wave attenuation. These studies have used either live vegetation, requiring full-scale wave testing, or surrogate vegetation, which allows simplified testing at either full- or reduced-scale. Overall, live vegetation studies have been limited in the variety of saltmarsh plants considered, with few studies considering plant species native to the Canadian coastline. Several physical modelling studies have been performed using surrogate plants, however, methods of surrogate development for flexible vegetation or reduced-scale testing are not yet well developed. This thesis aims to address knowledge gaps pertaining to the use of marsh vegetation in coastal protection strategies, particularly through the development of experimental methods with both live and surrogate plants. A full-scale flume study with live vegetation was performed to develop fundamental knowledge of wave-vegetation interactions for Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens, two salt marsh species native to Canada’s Atlantic coast. S. alterniflora was observed to demonstrate a resistance strategy in response to hydrodynamic forcing, versus the avoidance strategy of S. patens, supporting complementary functioning of the two species if utilized together in coastal protection schemes. Observations of plant properties and stem bending from live plant tests were subsequently applied in the development of a small-scale flume study, which examined wave attenuation associated with a downscaled S. alterniflora meadow in the configuration of a “living dyke” structure. Wave damping induced by surrogate vegetation was observed to be minimal for the tested wave conditions (0.073 m < Hm0 < 0.225 m, 2.0 < Tp < 3.2 s, 1:4 scale) and beach slope (1V:20H), with wave height evolution dominated by wave shoaling and breaking. Several methods were considered for modelling the S. alterniflora meadow at reduced scale, and results demonstrated a sensitivity to surrogate diameter but not flexibility. The development of robust experimental methods for investigating the performance of nature-based coastal infrastructure is essential for the establishment of appropriate design conditions. The scale series approach of this thesis supports such methodological advancements and is expected to make preliminary contributions to design guidance on coastal marsh-based NBS and provide critical direction for future studies.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognized as viable tools for sustainable urban water management. This article explores the implementation of NbS in two distinct cities, Singapore and Lisbon, to demonstrate that NbS can work in very different contexts and spark new thoughts on the urban–nature relationship and to identify commonalities that drive and enable the implementation of NbS in different context. Literature review-based research was conducted to examine the types of NbS implemented, the common drivers, the governance model, and the plural functionalities of the solutions. The research shows that, despite the differences, the two cities shared common drivers (including water supply, flood control, and resident demand for green space) and goals, such as improving water quality and overall quality of life, through the deployment of NbS. With rapid urban expansion, water use increase, and the impacts of climate change, NbS can be effective tools to deliver integrated benefits and improve the liveability of cities.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognized as sustainable approaches to address societal challenges. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) has benefited by moving away from purely 'grey' infrastructure measures towards NbS. However, this shift also furthers an increasing trend of reliance on public acceptance to plan, implement and manage DRR measures. In this review, we examine how unique NbS characteristics relate to public acceptance through a comparison with grey measures, and we identify influential acceptance factors related to individuals, society, and DRR measures. Based on the review, we introduce the PA-NbS model that highlights the role of risk perception, trust, competing societal interests, and ecosystem services. Efforts to increase acceptance should focus on providing and promoting awareness of benefits combined with effective communication and collaboration. Further research is required to understand interconnections among identified factors and how they can be leveraged for the success and further uptake of NbS.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognised for their potential to address both the climate and biodiversity crises. These outcomes are interdependent, and both rely on the capacity of NbS to support and enhance the health of an ecosystem: its biodiversity, the condition of its abiotic and biotic elements, and its capacity to function normally despite environmental change. However, while understanding of ecosystem health outcomes of nature-based interventions for climate change mitigation is growing, the outcomes of those implemented for adaptation remain poorly understood with evidence scattered across multiple disciplines. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of the outcomes of 109 nature-based interventions for climate change adaptation using 33 indicators of ecosystem health across eight broad categories (e.g. diversity, biomass, ecosystem functioning and population dynamics). We showed that 88% of interventions with positive outcomes for climate change adaptation also reported measurable benefits for ecosystem health. We also showed that interventions were associated with a 67% average increase in local species richness. All eight studies that reported benefits in terms of both climate change mitigation and adaptation also supported ecosystem health, leading to a triple win. However, there were also trade-offs, mainly for forest management and creation of novel ecosystems such as monoculture plantations of non-native species. Our review highlights two major limitations of research to date. First, only a limited selection of metrics are used to assess ecosystem health and these rarely include key aspects such as functional diversity and habitat connectivity. Second, taxonomic coverage is poor: 67% of outcomes assessed only plants and 57% did not distinguish between native and non-native species. Future research addressing these issues will allow the design and adaptive management of NbS to support healthy and resilient ecosystems, and thereby enhance their effectiveness for meeting both climate and biodiversity targets.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly being considered as an option to reduce societies’ vulnerability to natural hazards, creating co-benefits while protecting ecosystem services in a context of changing climate patterns with more frequent and extreme weather events. The reinsurance and insurance industries are increasingly cited as sectors that can play a role to help manage risks, by improving disaster risk reduction (DRR) and loss prevention. This paper investigates how the (re)insurance industry could support the transition from a paradigm focused on ex-post responses to ex-ante risk reduction measures including NBS, in line with the Sendai Framework. This paper presents the results of a series of 61 interviews undertaken with the (re)insurance sector and related actors under the EU H2020 Nature Insurance Value Assessment and Demonstration (NAIAD) project. Methods based on a Grounded Theory approach indicate how this sector can play different roles in loss prevention, including ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (eco-DRR). Results illustrate how the (re)insurance industry, under these roles, is gradually innovating by having a better understanding of hazards and mitigation. The findings of the study contribute to wider discussions such as the possibility of new arrangements like natural insurance schemes and evidence-based assessment of avoided damage costs from green protective measures, in Europe and beyond.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are actions inspired by, supported by, or copied from nature, that deploy various natural features and processes, are resource efficient and adapted to systems in diverse spatial areas, facing social, environmental, and economic challenges. The main goals of NBS are the enhancement of sustainable urbanisation (Figure ES.1), the restoration of degraded ecosystems, the development of climate change adaptation and mitigation, and the improvement of risk management and resilience. Moreover, NBS address global challenges, directly connected to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). NBS provide multiple benefits and have been identified as critical for the regeneration and improvement of wellbeing in urban areas, coastal resilience, multifunctional watershed management, and ecosystem restoration. They also increase the sustainability of matter and energy use, enhance the insurance value of ecosystems, and increase carbon sequestration. The vision of the European Commission is to position the EU as a leader in naturebased innovation for sustainable and resilient societies. Establishing an NBS evidence and knowledge base, developing a repository of best practices, creating an NBS Community of Innovators, and improving communication ' and NBS awareness are the main actions to achieve this vision. The added value of the NBS knowledge repository would be better dissemination and visibility, and better uptake and mainstreaming of NBS, as well as contributing to and establishing lively Community of Practice. The evidence for NBS includes NBS case studies, business cases, facts and figures supporting NBS effectiveness and NBS added value, and successes and failures.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) address socio-environmental challenges by sustainably managing ecosystems that offer and support the delivery of various services. NbS can integrate locally relevant options for maintaining ecosystems, thus, encourages the participation of local stakeholders. For instance, mangroves referred here as “blue carbon ecosystem infrastructures” (BCEIs), are being reforested by local stakeholders because of their role in coastal protection and, increasingly, for their contribution to global carbon sequestration. This study examined two mangrove eco-parks in Panay Island, Philippines using perception surveys to (1) offer empirical evidence of the impacts of well-implemented BCEIs, (2) obtain conceptual implications of NbS, and (3) provide practical prospects for BCEI applications in the country. Results show that respondents who access the eco-parks have higher awareness compared to people who did not use it, suggesting eco-parks can promote mangrove awareness. Local's utilization of provisioning and cultural services of the eco-parks indicates that mangroves can be a valuable income source. Engaging residents in the management of eco-parks boosts their participation and willingness to lead. The mutualistic relationship between locals and mangroves observed in this study implies the positive effect of BCEI in the country particularly on people’s well-being, coastal protection, and climate change mitigation if implemented and maintained successfully.

AB  - Nature-based solution (Nbs) is an empirical approach in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Coastal ecosystem–based Nbs is more proactive in reducing the risk of coastal hazards and thus assist communities in adapting to or mitigating climate change. This chapter aims to explore the role of coastal natural features as Nbs on increasing resilient food security for coastal climate–vulnerable people through providing food diversity. It also envisions to explore the role of coastal natural ecosystems such as coastal dunes, salt marshes, seagrass beds, how lagoons serve as natural buffers against cyclones, storm surges, sea waves, tidal surges, tidal floods, and protect the shoreline from coastal erosion and sea level rise. This chapter will also illustrate the performance of these ecosystems-based services, sand dunes, and other coastal ecosystem features on climate change adaptation and mitigation services through carbon storage and sequestration, groundwater storage, and land protection. The study was conducted in Kolapara of Patukhali district which is adjacent to Bay of Bengal and known as Kuakata beach. The study was conducted using RS and GIS, participatory research including household survey, focus group discussion, key informants interview, historical disaster loss analysis, and incorporating secondary information from different sources including scientific articles. The study illustrates that coastal natural features are most important Nbs to reduce hydrometeorlogical disaster and climate change adaptation and mitigating. But due to lack of consciousness, overexploitation, and lack of integrated coastal management approaches, most of these important ecosystem features are going to be lost or diminished.

AB  - Nature-based risk mitigation is increasingly proposed as a strategy to cope with global changes that increase flood risks in coastal areas. However, loss of coastal ecosystems reduces their mitigating effect on coastal flood risks in many places around the world. Here, we identify global urban hot spots exposed to storm surge flood risks, where conservation of existing coastal ecosystems can contribute to nature-based risk mitigation. We present a global procedure identifying the most likely pathways followed by storm surges from the open sea toward 136 cities around the world and quantifying the extent of mangrove forests, salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs along these storm surge pathways. Instead of being locally precise, our procedure aims to be globally applicable, in order to identify cities around the world where ecosystems can have a positive effect on storm surge risk mitigation and where further local-scale, more precise assessments are advised. Our results show that cities that combine large flood-exposed populations (> 400,000 people exposed to 1-in-100-year storm events) and large potential for nature-based risk mitigation (> 200 km2 of coastal ecosystems) are located in large river deltas and estuaries, such as Khulna (Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, Bangladesh), Guayaquil (Guayas delta, Ecuador), Ho Chi Minh City (Mekong delta, Vietnam), and New Orleans (Mississippi Delta, USA). Here, conservation of mangroves and salt marshes plays a key role. Cities with large flood-exposed populations and/or assets, but few ecosystems, are either located directly adjacent to coastlines or where former wetlands have been reclaimed, especially in European and Asian cities. Overall, 75% of the studied cities benefit from flood risk mitigation by present ecosystems and from additional ecosystem services. Hence, our study identifies global urban hot spots where more detailed local studies are advised on the effectiveness of conservation and (re-)creation of coastal ecosystems as a sustainable strategy for nature-based mitigation of increasing coastal flood risks.

AB  - Nature-based infrastructure (NBI) ties together ecology and planning. It is significant as an innovation and because it potentiates new and different humanenvironment relations. Drawing upon recent anthropological efforts to explore multispecies entanglements, this thesis considers the NBI work of the Massachusetts Oyster Project. It examines the ecological communities the organization joins in its efforts to restore the Eastern oyster, and it evaluates those relationships as indicators of potential shifts in state environmental policy. This thesis also elaborates multispecies planning as a concept. It incorporates evidence from ethnography, environmental science, philosophy, and political theory, and finds that the framework offers planners two lessons. First, it is now necessary to attend to many forms of knowledge in the planning process, not all of which are human. Second, entertaining such findings points to new ways of reasoning environmental matters of concern. Both lessons are given in the example of Massachusetts state shellfish policy.

AB  - Nature-based flood defences (NBFD) are receiving considerable attention in the coastal adaptation field. Advocates of NBFD point to their cost-effectiveness, flexibility and the range of co-benefits they produce beside flood risk reduction. However, NBFD are not yet common practice. One reason for this may be found in financial barriers. To date, there has been little attention for financial aspects of NBFD, as the literature has focused on design, effectiveness and socio-economic impact of such projects. We address this gap by analysing the financial attractiveness of real-world NBFD from the perspective of the public actor. We address the following research questions: through which mechanisms can public investments in NBFD projects be leveraged? and ii) what are the enabling conditions for these mechanisms? We find two types of revenue generating mechanisms: value capture, in which the public actor generates revenues from private beneficiaries through taxes; and co-investment, in which the project attracts in-kind or cash contributions from other actors. We illustrate the potential of these leveraging mechanisms in four case studies and find that NBFD can generate significant tax revenues in locations with high demand for certain co-benefits, whereas project size, type, timing and beneficiaries of co-benefits determine the potential for co-investment.

AB  - Nature-based flood defence is an innovative design alternative for achieving protection against flooding. Despite significant advancements in science, models and concepts, routine implementation beyond pilot projects remains limited. To better understand why, we have looked into the complexities of nature-based flood defence implementation and its resolutions, modelling decision-making situations using game theory in three nature-based flood defence cases: The Markermeer Dikes, the Afsluitdijk Dam and the Sand Engine. We observe that nature-based flood defence games are of a multi-level and nested nature. While the decision of whether to employ a nature-based flood defence is seemingly made at the project level, this can only happen when it is coherent with the institutional context that is determined at the policy level. A social dilemma is apparent: while a multi-functional nature-based solution is attractive to a coalition of actors, it is not the most beneficial option for individual actors. Hence, they are faced with the dilemma of opting for their maximum benefit or opting for the greater societal benefit which is less favorable to them. This social dilemma can be tackled by making ‘smart moves’, as inspired by the Sand Engine case. The nested nature of the problem requires structural change in the institutional context to enable favourable conditions for nature-based flood defence implementations.

AB  - Nature-based coastal protection is increasingly recognised as a potentially sustainable and cost-effective solution to reduce coastal flood risk. It uses coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests to create resilient designs for coastal flood protection. However, to use mangroves effectively as a nature-based measure for flood risk reduction, we must understand the biophysical processes that govern risk reduction capacity through mangrove ecosystem size and structure. In this perspective, we evaluate the current state of knowledge on local physical drivers and ecological processes that determine mangrove functioning as part of a nature-based flood defence. We show that the forest properties that comprise coastal flood protection are well-known, but models cannot yet pinpoint how spatial heterogeneity of the forest structure affects the capacity for wave or surge attenuation. Overall, there is relatively good understanding of the ecological processes that drive forest structure and size, but there is a lack of knowledge on how daily bed-level dynamics link to long-term biogeomorphic forest dynamics, and on the role of combined stressors influencing forest retreat. Integrating simulation models of forest structure under changing physical (e.g. due to sea-level change) and ecological drivers with hydrodynamic attenuation models will allow for better projections of long-term natural coastal protection.

AB  - Nature-based coastal defense schemes commonly value bivalve reefs for i) reducing coastal erosion in the intertidal and for ii) forming fringing reefs near salt marsh edges to protect them against lateral retreat. The capacity for a reef to reduce erosion increases at a higher position in the tidal frame as the lower over-lying water level magnifies the influence of the reef on wave attenuation. Unfortunately, ecological constraints on reef development typically limit their practical application in coastal protection schemes to the lower intertidal, as bivalves grow best with long inundation times. In micro-tidal areas this is a lesser problem, given the close proximity of lower and upper intertidal ecosystems in space. By contrast, in meso- and macro-tidal estuaries, bivalve reefs tend to form hundreds of meters away from existing marshes, nullifying any wave-protective benefits. In this study, we produce evidence that with the assistance of management measures, widespread reef formation is possible on open mudflats, including bordering the marsh edge in meso- and macro-tidal estuaries, where natural reef formation is normally strongly limited. In four locations throughout the meso- to macro-tidal Dutch Scheldt estuary, we observed the presence of individuals of two major intertidal reef-forming bivalves, Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), within low-lying Spartina anglica-dominated marshes. As these communities lie well outside of the expected range of reef formation, this observation suggests the existence of mechanisms that extend the habitable range of these bivalves. In a series of field experiments, we first demonstrate how the stabilization of shell-substrate within the marsh promotes successful establishment and adult survival. Secondly, by placing artificial stable substrate in transects from the subtidal up to the marsh edge, we demonstrate that bivalve establishment is possible throughout a much larger range of the intertidal than where natural reefs occur. The effectiveness of stable substrate in stimulating bivalve establishment is likely a consequence of bridging size-dependent thresholds that limit the effective range for natural reef formation on tidal flats. The success of this approach is tempered by a consistent decrease in reef size and growth at higher elevations, suggesting that the optimal reef position for utility in coastal defense lies at an intermediate tidal position, well above the observed range of natural occurrence, but below the maximum achievable upper limit of reef formation. Together this work provides a pathway forward concerning how artificial reefs may be fostered to increase their utility as a nature-based flood defense measure.

AB  - Nature embodies different concepts for different people, including biodiversity, ecosystems, Mother Earth, systems of life and other analogous concepts. Nature’s contributions to people embody different concepts such as ecosystem goods and services, and nature’s gifts. Both nature and nature’s contributions to people are vital for human existence and good quality of life (human well-being, living in harmony with nature, living well in balance and harmony with Mother Earth, and other analogous concepts).While more food, energy and materials than ever before are now being supplied to people in most places, this is increasingly at the expense of nature’s ability to provide such contributions in the future and frequently undermines nature’s many other contributions, which range from water quality regulation to sense of place. The biosphere, upon which humanity as a whole depends, is being altered to an unparalleled degree across all spatial scales. Biodiversity – the diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems – is declining faster than at any time in human history.

However, little still is known about the role that the many uncertainties associated with such projects play in the effectiveness of these solutions, and about how to cope with these uncertainties, considering the impacts NbS may have for our society. Here, we investigate, if and how, managing uncertainties via the cascades of interrelated uncertainties conceptual framework improves the governance capacity for implementing NbS coastal management projects. To this end, we conduct an ex-post analysis of the uncertainties in two NbS study cases: Sand Engine and Safety Buffer Oyster Dam BwN projects in The Netherlands, critically analyzing through the conceptual framework, how uncertainties were addressed and proposing better fit supporting alternatives. Our results indicate major benefits for uncertainty management, supporting project development and implementation: generating more flexibility in managing under unknown conditions, being able to anticipate conflict, providing opportunities of creating new supporting relationships and alternative solutions.

AB  - Nature Based Solutions (NBS) are currently gaining importance in the EU policy agenda as a promising approach to mitigate and adapt to environmental and climate change. The main advantage of NBS over other adaptation strategies is their capability to deliver multiple benefits. They support the resilience of natural processes and help in reducing adaptation costs. In this paper, we address the current gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive, easy-to-use classification scheme focussing on hydrological extreme events. The classification scheme is presented as a matrix and contains a portfolio of known NBS as well as the important criteria for their selection. Specifically, we have included disservices/ barriers, and the potential impacts of climate change on NBS. The matrix provides decision-makers with a tool that will guide them through the first phase of the complex process when choosing the most appropriative NBS for a specific challenge. In that way, we aim to support the spread of NBS in the scientific literature as well as their practical application.

AB  - Nature based coastal adaptation (NbCA) sustainably helps minimize sea-level rise impacts, using and enhancing the natural capacity of coastal ecosystems. Despite its relative advantages over conventional hard protection infrastructure, the implementation of NbCA is challenged by diverse barriers, many of which cannot be overcome in the absence of appropriate policy directives. This paper draws on organizational practitioners’ case study narratives collected from six NbCA projects planned and/or implemented in Nova Scotia, Canada, to answer how the implementation of NbCA approaches can be navigated through adoption barriers. Results reveal that institutional and psychological barriers dominate, and they also show path-dependency. In addition, barriers are often influenced by the biophysical properties of a restoration site. To navigate through barriers, it is important to identify policy opportunities and redistribute roles and responsibilities. Organizational knowledge creation through partnership and community engagement are two other strategies required for the successful implementation of NbCA.

AB  - Natural landscapes serve our well-being in a variety of ways including water purification, flood protection, hurricane protection, carbon capture, recreation and wildlife enhancement. Identifying and understanding the benefits of services provided by local ecosystems can lead to cost-effective solutions to infrastructural and environmental problems while also creating enhanced biodiversity in urban/suburban areas. For the storm-prone Greater Houston region, the critical need to better connect the ecosystem services (ES) provided by the diverse assemblages of forests, prairies, wetlands, riparian waterways and estuaries to long-term resilience and disaster protection is taking shape following four years of increased rain events, severe hurricane destruction and sea level rise. Adding to these challenges are the region's unique, clay-rich soil composition, made up largely of vertisols and alfisols which greatly influence infiltration and runoff, especially during heavy rain events. These same soils affect environmental enhancement and recovery efforts in the region's bays and estuaries, where the dynamics of various commercial industries intersect with fisheries, coastal wetlands and marine life. Greater knowledge and understanding of the region's soil composition, by both scientists and decision-makers, can help guide the discussion and implementation of billions of dollars in post-disaster projects targeting improvements in critical ecosystem services.

We tested this prediction for Mexico by performing regression models, with two dependent variables: the occurrence of deaths and economic damages, at a state and municipality levels. For each location, the explanatory variables were the Mexican social vulnerability index (which includes socioeconomic aspects, local capacity to prevent and respond to an emergency, and the perception of risk) and land use cover considering different vegetation types. We used the hydrometeorological events that have affected Mexico from 1970 to 2011. Our findings reveal that: (a) hydrometeorological events affect both coastal and inland states, although damages are greater on the coast; (b) the protective role of natural ecosystems only was clear at a municipality level: the presence of mangroves, tropical dry forest and tropical rainforest was related to a significant reduction in the occurrence of casualties. Social vulnerability was positively correlated with the occurrence of deaths. Natural ecosystems, both typically coastal (mangroves) and terrestrial (tropical forests, which are located on the mountain ranges close to the coast) function for storm protection. Thus, their conservation and restoration are effective and sustainable strategies that will help protect and develop the increasingly urbanized coasts.

AB  - Natural disturbances and environmental changes affect coastal communities around the world. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of many of these disturbances, members of affected communities will face greater threats to both their lives and livelihoods. And hence, there is a significant need for communities to adopt measures of protection. While traditional hard engineering structures are used by some countries, many developing countries face financial and/or technical difficulties in implementing these solutions. As such, soft engineering structures, like Nature-based Solutions (NbS), have been adopted as alternatives; mangroves have been especially popular due to their effectiveness and ecological co-benefits. This chapter, reviews the literature on the use of mangroves as an NbS strategy for coastal defense and pollution mitigation, and presents a community-based framework for mangrove DRR implementation.

AB  - Native oyster (Ostrea edulis) habitat has been decimated across the majority of its natural range as a result of human activity. In recent decades, oyster restoration projects have gathered increasing support due to their potential to provide ecosystem services that offset increasing pressure from human development, resource demand, and also climate change. These ecosystem services are reviewed here, so as to inform the potential benefit of restoration projects. Ecosystem services can be divided into four categories: provisioning services through direct utilisation of oysters and the species they support, regulating services that help maintain a healthy environment, habitat services that benefit biodiversity, and cultural services that can influence tourism and wider cultural values. Ecosystem services are often interlinked in complex networks, though these can be linked back to two overarching ecosystem functions, stemming from either the filter feeding activity of oysters, or the physical reef structure that they provide. The MARINEFF oyster enhancement reefs installed in the Solent, September 2020, are intended to support the extensive Solent Oyster Restoration Project initiated by the Blue Marine Foundation. The expectation is that they will facilitate both oyster settlement and the release of larvae for the repopulation of the Solent system. This may contribute to the recovery of ecosystem services mentioned in this review. It is important to note however that there is a lack of baseline data for native oysters, and the ecosystem service values they provide are poorly constrained, meaning that ecosystem service estimates are derived largely from other species of oyster. This inhibits our ability to accurately calculate and model natural capital provided by native oysters, highlighting the necessity for further research so as to inform management and restoration targets.

AB  - Nations of the world have, to date, pursued nature protection and climate change mitigation and adaptation policies separately. Both efforts have failed to achieve the scale of action needed to halt biodiversity loss or mitigate climate change. We argue that success can be achieved by aligning targets for biodiversity protection with the habitat protection and restoration necessary to bring down greenhouse gas concentrations and promote natural and societal adaptation to climate change. Success, however, will need much higher targets for environmental protection than the present 10% of sea and 17% of land. A new target of 30% of the sea given high levels of protection from exploitation and harm by 2030 is under consideration and similar targets are being discussed for terrestrial habitats. We make the case here that these higher targets, if achieved, would make the transition to a warmer world slower and less damaging for nature and people. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB  - National climate goals under the Paris Agreement (Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) are currently insufficient to address the climate crisis. Yet the promise of the Agreement is that it created not only an initial set of commitments but also a “ratchet” cycle, in which countries submit NDCs every five years. Until recently, the international climate effort and the ocean conservation effort have been largely siloed. Although a majority of countries referenced the ocean in their first round of NDCs, only a minority discussed ocean actions as climate solutions. Fewer than 20 percent of countries with coastal blue carbon ecosystems, for example, discussed their role as carbon sinks. 1,2,3 There is increasing recognition of the linkages between the ocean and climate change. As Parties to the Paris Agreement communicate their second round of national climate goals, this policy brief tracks the inclusion of concrete, ocean-based mitigation and adaptation actions. It sorts commitments first by ocean-based solution and then by country. Updates to this brief will post regularly, as countries submit further NDCs.

AB  - Much of the United States’ critical infrastructure is either aging or requires significant repair, leaving U.S. communities and the economy vulnerable. Outdated and dilapidated infrastructure places coastal communities, in particular, at risk from the increasingly frequent and intense coastal storm events and rising sea levels. Therefore, investments in coastal infrastructure are urgently needed to ensure community safety and prosperity; however, these investments should not jeopardize the ecosystems and natural resources that underlie economic wealth and human well-being. Over the past 50 years, efforts have been made to integrate built infrastructure with natural landscape features, often termed “green” infrastructure, in order to sustain and restore valuable ecosystem functions and services. For example, significant advances have been made in implementing green infrastructure approaches for stormwater management, wastewater treatment, and drinking water conservation and delivery. However, the implementation of natural and nature-based infrastructure (NNBI) aimed at flood prevention and coastal erosion protection is lagging. There is an opportunity now, as the U.S. government reacts to the recent, unprecedented flooding and hurricane damage and considers greater infrastructure investments, to incorporate NNBI into coastal infrastructure projects. Doing so will increase resilience and provide critical services to local communities in a cost-effective manner and thereby help to sustain a growing economy.

AB  - MPAs enhance some of the Ecosystem Services (ES) provided by coral reefs and clear, robust valuations of these impacts may help to improve stakeholder support and better inform decision-makers. Pursuant to this goal, Cost-Benefit Analyses (CBA) of MPAs in 2 different contexts were analysed: a community based MPA with low tourism pressure in Vanuatu, and a government managed MPA with relatively high tourism pressure, in Saint Martin. Assessments were made on six ES: fish biomass, scenic beauty, protection against coastal erosion, bequest and existence values, social capital and CO2 sequestration, which were quantified via different approaches that included experimental fishery, surveys and benefit transfer. Total operating costs for each MPA were collected and the benefit-cost ratio and return on investment based on 25-year discounted projections computed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on MPA impacts, and discount rates (5%, 7% and 10%). The investment indicators all showed positive results with the impact on the tourism ES being the largest estimated for all MPAs, highlighting the importance of this relationship. The study also demonstrated a relatively high sensitivity of the results to different levels of impacts on ES, which highlights the need for reducing scientific knowledge gaps.

AB  - Mozambique is one of the countries most exposed to coastal and river flooding in Africa. The majority of flood and erosion protection investments are still made in the rehabilitation and construction of grey infrastructure, such as drainage canals, retention basins, protection walls and their appurtenant infrastructures. While there are several reasons to consider for and against grey infrastructure including the degree of urbanization, existing infrastructure, local capacities (construction and operation), etc., nature-based solutions are becoming a preferred option by international financing institutions, national agencies as well as local stakeholders. Especially when looking at small-scale interventions (e.g. afforestation measures), nature-based solutions can be a more cost-effective option and may also be implemented and operated / maintained by local agents, including communities and NGOs (Non-governmental organization). INROS LACKNER SE is involved in several climate change adaptation projects in Mozambique. The primary outcomes of the recent project on nature-based coastal protection in the pilot city of Beira and consultancy work on upscaling nature-based flood protection in the cities of Quelimane and Nacala are described and discussed in the present paper.

AB  - Most studies addressing the future of atoll islands focused on ocean-climate drivers of risk, especially sea-level rise, and disregarded the role of local human disturbances. However, the future habitability of these countries will critically depend on the response of inhabited and exploited islands to ocean-climate pressures. Here, using the Maldives as a case study and based on a database including 608 islands (representing 56.8% and 86.0% of the country’s land area and population, respectively), we assess the influence of human disturbances on island natural response capacity over the last decade. We show that over the last decade, island change was rapid and primarily controlled by anthropogenic drivers. The great majority of inhabited and exploited islands now exhibit an altered-to-annihilated capacity to respond to ocean-climate pressures, which has major implications for future research and adaptation strategies. First, future studies should consider not only climate, but also anthropogenic tipping points (in contrast to climate tipping points). Second, adaptation strategies must be implemented without delay, despite climate uncertainties, in order to contain any additional detrimental path-dependency effects. This study provides critical information for better addressing the attribution issue under climate change, and a replicable rapid assessment frame.

AB  - Mitigation activities seek to lessen the impact of a hazard on a community, or eliminate the hazard altogether. Mitigation activities, techniques, and the policies that govern them have evolved over time as human populations learned from and anticipated future crises. Mitigation strategies in the early 1900s relied heavily on structural mitigation in the form of large public works projects, such as dams and sea walls, to control environmental systems and limit human exposure to environmental extremes. Yet these practices encouraged development in high-risk hazard-prone areas. Beginning in the 1950s and peaking in the 1990s, emphasis shifted to the use of non-structural mitigation techniques, including land use regulations and hazard insurance, to steer development away from high-risk landscapes. Policies enacted during this time period and large-scale disasters of the 21st century provide important lessons for mitigation and building resilience to future events. Studies of hurricane damage in the United States led to improved building codes, and underscore the importance of nature-based mitigation strategies. Nature-based solutions, such as ecological engineering, ecological restoration as well as blue and green infrastructure development, harness the environment’s own defenses to protect human populations. For example, after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and earthquake, research showed that strategically placed vegetation could slow and dissipate tsunami waves. The European Commission has also encouraged protecting, restoring, and enhancing environmental features to mitigate against hazards. Moreover, the emergence of the climate change crisis and its ongoing impacts have led environmental scientists, ecologists, and disaster scientists to associate mitigation with emerging concepts such as sustainability, adaptation, and resilience. This association has resulted in the incorporation of mitigation efforts in a variety of planning tools, including sustainability and climate adaptation plans. This shift has produced mitigation strategies that prioritize equity and justice in climate hazard mitigation policy and planning. The future of mitigation will rely on collaboration and cooperation across many allied fields to build sustainable and resilient communities that can adapt and respond to future crises.

AB  - Marshes, and tidal salt marshes in particular, are gaining recognition as critical elements in sustainable shoreline protection (Narayan, Beck, Reguero, et al. 2016; Narayan, Beck, Wilson, et al. 2016; Spalding, Ruffo, et al. 2014; Spalding, McIvor, et al. 2014). They contribute to coastal resiliency not only by attenuating wave energy in large storms (Gedan et al. 2011; M¨oller, Kudella, et al. 2014), but also by maintaining the existence of coastal land (Kirwan et al. 2016), supporting fisheries (Boesch & Turner 1984; MacKenzie & Dionne 2008), sequestering carbon (Ouyang & Lee 2014), and removing contaminants (Dhir et al. 2009; Windham et al. 2003). These benefits directly contribute to the sustainability of the growing populations in coastal regions (Sutton-Grier, Wowk, et al. 2015). With this recognition, there are many ongoing projects to preserve existing salt marshes, restore former marshes, and create hybrids of natural and engineered structures (Pontee et al. 2016). These projects require an understanding of the underpinning processes that lead to marsh sustainability. The projects presented in this dissertation are efforts to better understand marsh dynamics. The first project explores the impact of emergent vegetation on gas flux in marsh surface waters. Wind causes the stems of emergent vegetation to wave back and forth, stirring the water column and facilitating gas exchange. To understand the magnitude of this effect, a gas transfer velocity (k600-value) was measured via laboratory experiments. Measuring this transport pathway contributes to a mechanistic understanding of gas flux and can improve models of climatically important gases. The second project examines wave attenuation across a salt marsh. Salt marsh vegetation is effective at reducing wave energy. It is important to understand how this attenuation varies. Through field measurements, wave attenuation is explored as a function of hydrodynamic conditions, season, and vegetation type. The results showed that even fringe marshes, which are common in San Francisco Bay, are effective at reducing wave energy year-round. The last project investigates the viability of using biosolids as an amendment to dredged material in marsh restorations. Biosolids is a reliable and sustainable source of sediment, and more sources of sediment are needed for marsh restoration projects. Both the aboveground and belowground biomass increased when vegetation was grown in soil containing biosolids as compared to only dredged material. Taken together, the three projects discussed here can contribute to improving the success and efficiency of marsh restoration and preservation.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are promising examples of Nature-Based Solutions that can protect diversity while delivering ecosystem services. However insufficient funding for effective management and expansion of MPAs remains a challenge and one that particularly affects developing countries. During the last ten years, a community of investors seeking positive social and environmental impacts alongside financial returns, have stepped in to help fill this marine conservation financing gap. An innovative collaborative management approach has been recently implemented in the Dominican Republic for one of the largest MPAs in the Caribbean. Blended finance solutions mixing catalytic, development and impact finance have been used to cover the up-front capital needs. MPA revenues are being generated for MPA management and investor returns, via a range of sustainable finance tools including fees paid by visitors. The solution offers interesting outcomes that uses catalytic and development finance to mobilise commercial impact finance into MPAs. From a Government point of view, the approach provides empirical evidence of how non-public funding can become part of the financing options for a country’s MPA network, reducing the financial burden on Public Budgets. Scalability of the approach seems limited by the number of MPAs with tangible business models.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being promoted as an ocean-based climate solution. However, such claims remain controversial because of the diffuse and poorly synthesized literature on climate benefits of MPAs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of 22,403 publications spanning 241 MPAs and analyzed these across 16 ecological and social pathways through which MPAs could contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that marine conservation can significantly enhance carbon sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity, and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms as well as fishers’ catch and income. Most of these benefits are only achieved in fully or highly protected areas and increase with MPA age. Although MPAs alone cannot offset all climate change impacts, they are a useful tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation of social-ecological systems.

AB  - Marine ecosystems have been used, impacted by, and managed by human populations for millennia. As ecosystem degradation has been a common outcome of these activities, marine management increasingly considers ecosystem restoration. Currently, there is no coherent data recording format or framework for marine restoration projects. As a result, data are inconsistently recorded and it is difficult to universally track progress, assess restoration's global effectiveness, reduce reporting bias, collect a holistic suite of metrics, and share information. Barriers to developing a unified system for reporting marine restoration outcomes include: reaching agreement on a framework that meets the needs of all users, funding its development and maintenance, balancing the need for ‘ease of use’ and detail, and demonstrating the value of using the framework. However, there are opportunities to leverage arising from the United Nation Decades of Ecosystem Restoration and Science for Sustainable Development and with existing processes already developed by restoration groups (e.g. Global Mangrove Alliance, Society for Ecological Restoration). Here we provide guidelines and a roadmap for how such a framework could be developed and the potential benefits of such an endeavor. We call on practitioners to collaborate to develop such a framework and on governing bodies to commit to making detailed reporting a requirement for restoration project funding. Using a standardized marine restoration monitoring framework would enable the application of adaptive management when projects are not progressing as expected, advance our understanding of the state of worldwide marine restoration, and generate knowledge to advance restoration methodologies.

AB  - Marine and coastal ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. Coastal and marine EbA involves governing and managing ecosystems to enhance their resilience to climatic stresses in the coastal zone. This entails maintaining and, where possible, improving the quality and quantity of ecosystem services provided to society; and in so doing supporting communities to adapt to current and future climate risks. As a result more sustainable forms of development will be achieved, strengthening livelihoods in ways that reduce poverty and environmental degradation.

AB  - Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

AB  - Many coastal peri-urban and urban populations in Oceania are heavily reliant on terrestrial and marine ecosystem services for subsistence and wellbeing. However, climate change and urbanisation have put significant pressure on ecosystems and compelled nations and territories in Oceania to urgently adapt. This article, with a focus on Pacific Island Oceania but some insight from Aotearoa New Zealand, reviews key literature focused on ecosystem health and human health and wellbeing in Oceania and the important potential contribution of nature-based solutions to limiting the negative impacts of climate change and urbanisation. The inextricable link between human wellbeing and provision of ecosystem services is well established. However, given the uniqueness of Oceania, rich in cultural and biological diversity and traditional ecological knowledge, these links require further examination leading potentially to a new conceptualisation of wellbeing frameworks in relation to human/nature relationships.

AB  - Many coastal peri-urban and urban populations in Oceania are heavily reliant on terrestrial and marine ecosystem services for subsistence and wellbeing. However, climate change and urbanisation have put significant pressure on ecosystems and compelled nations and territories in Oceania to urgently adapt. This article, with a focus on Pacific Island Oceania but some insight from Aotearoa New Zealand, reviews key literature focused on ecosystem health and human health and wellbeing in Oceania and the important potential contribution of nature-based solutions to limiting the negative impacts of climate change and urbanisation. The inextricable link between human wellbeing and provision of ecosystem services is well established. However, given the uniqueness of Oceania, rich in cultural and biological diversity and traditional ecological knowledge, these links require further examination leading potentially to a new conceptualisation of wellbeing frameworks in relation to human/nature relationships. Rapidly urbanising Oceania has a growing body of rural, peri-urban and urban nature-based solutions experience to draw from. However, important gaps in knowledge and practice remain. Pertinently, there is a need, potential—and therefore opportunity—to define an urban design agenda positioned within an urban ecosystem services framework, focused on human wellbeing and informed by traditional ecological knowledge, determined by and relevant for those living in the islands of Oceania as a means to work towards effective urban climate change adaptation.

AB  - Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses are conspicuous and important features of the Sri Lankan coastline, playing an important role in delivering multiple ecosystem services including carbon sequestration (the so-called blue carbon ecosystems). Together, they support coastal biodiversity, provide habitat and nutrition for numerous plant and animal species, protect vulnerable coastlines and support millions of human beings. Sri Lanka is now placing itself at the forefront of marine conservation by becoming the first nation to legislatively protect all its remaining mangrove forests. The current area of mangrove forest in Sri Lanka (19,500 ha) is less than that of salt marsh (33,573 ha) and seagrass meadows (23,819 ha). There is, however, considerable uncertainty in these estimates, particularly in some regions, which hampers policy development and conservation goals. While knowledge of the value of ecosystem services provided by mangrove forests is improving (e.g. value to fisheries, national estimates of carbon stocks and sequestration rates), comparable studies on saltmarsh and seagrass ecosystems are rare and this is reflected in their governance and legal protection. Further, while there are considerable efforts to restore lost mangrove forests (i.e. more than 1200 ha restored, with ambitious plans for 10,000 ha), restoration of seagrasses and salt marshes remains largely unattempted. The current disparity in the state of knowledge of blue carbon ecosystems must be addressed through application of robust science that extends descriptive data and theoretical assumptions to generate deeper knowledge on the structure, function and socio-economic value of each of these important ecosystems. Overall, this review seeks to summarise the state of these important higher-plant-dominated coastal ecosystems in Sri Lanka. We seek to help set a research agenda to ensure the nation becomes a regional leader with respect the protection, conservation and restoration of its coastal zone, thereby ensuring continued delivery of important ecosystem services, especially blue carbon sequestration.

AB  - Mangroves have demonstrated the potential to provide engineering services to shorelines through wave attenuation, inland load reduction, and erosion mitigation. However, to confidently leverage these and other natural and nature-based features as coastal protection alternatives, their performance must be quantified over a broad range of environmental conditions that may interact with these systems in nature, ranging from daily stressors to extreme events. This paper examines the attenuation of 236 vessel-generated wakes through red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) using high-frequency pressure sensors positioned at the fringe (X = 0 m), middle (X = 6.8 m), and sheltered edge (rear, X = 12.6 m) of a narrow mangrove stand near Key West, FL. We observed average characteristic wave height reductions of 38% and 65% at the middle and rear positions, respectively. At the rear of the mangrove stand, wave height attenuation increased with increasing incident relative wave height and increasing incident wave steepness for the range of characteristic wave heights, periods, and water depths observed. A subset of wake events for which water particle velocity measurements were available suggests proportionality between wave height and water particle velocity, which may indicate that transmission coefficients calculated for wave heights may be representative of water particle velocity attenuation as well. This work provides quantitative data to expand the parameter space assessing the performance of natural and nature-based infrastructure in mitigating chronic stressors such as vessel-generated wakes, which may be major drivers of erosion in developed coastal and estuarine regions.

AB  - Mangroves have been converted and degraded for decades. Rates of loss have declined over the past decades, but achieving resilient coastlines requires both conservation and restoration. Here, we outline the challenges for the global restoration of mangroves and what actions could enhance restoration. Ambitious global targets for mangrove restoration, if successful, could deliver global benefits of carbon sequestration, fisheries production, biodiversity, and coastal protection. However, large-scale mangrove planting efforts have often failed, and smaller projects may not deliver landscape-scale benefits, even though they are more suited to community management. Solutions to achieving global targets include reducing risks of large projects and increasing the uptake and effectiveness of smaller projects. Sustainable mangrove restoration requires investment in capacity building in communities and institutions, and mechanisms to match restoration opportunities with prospective supporters and investors. Global reporting standards will support adaptive management and help fully understand and monitor the benefits of mangrove restoration.

AB  - Mangroves can provide coastal protection by attenuating waves, currents, and trapping sediment (Menéndez et al., 2020; Bao, 2011). The effect of mangroves on the hydrodynamics depends on their size, location, density, distribution and morphology of the vegetation (Mendez and Losada, 2004). Mangrove loss during storm events will therefore impact the coastal protection. The soil-root interaction and influences of soil properties in the resistance of a mangrove tree against failure is neglected in most studies of flood protection by mangroves, due to a lack in understading. This thesis improves the understanding of the soil-root interaction by deriving the schematization for multiple failure mechanisms in comparison with field observations. Firstly, the wind and wave forces are modelled to determine the different loads in the forest. Secondly, a novel schematization was developed of different failure mechanisms considering the soil properties and root system. All results are developed for a case study of a fringe forest in Demak, existing of Avicennia marina rooted in a silty, saturated soil. To be able to determine the difference between the seaward and landward edge of the forest, the width of the forest is increased to 500 meter. Also, due to a lack of information on the mechanical strength of Avicennia m., the mechanical properties of Rhizophora m. are used, which will overestimate the resistance due to the higher wood density of Rhizophora m. (Manguriu et al., 2013). The results show that the drag forces were largely influenced by the tree architecture (such as vegetation width and height), forest density and inundation of the tree. Larger wind and wave forces, and therefore a larger moment occured if the width of the vegetation increased. If the height of the tree increases, a smaller part of the canopy is submerged. This leads to a decreased area that is exposed to waves and therefore a declined wave force. A higher tree does enlarge the area subjected to wind forces, resulting in an increased total moment. Overall, the 2.8-meter tree analysed in this thesis experienced the largest horizontal forces and moment at the seaward edge of the forest due to the relatively large water depth at this location. Furthermore, the maximum horizontal force and moment shift to the landward edge for larger trees due to the increase of wind contribution. To investigate the stability under these loads, the different failure mechanisms need to be inspected. The failure mechanisms of root breakage and slippage are not important because of the high safety factors and no observations in the field. The failure mechanism trunk breakage also showed a high safety factor, contradictiory to field observations pulling willow trees. The model results and field observations showed that a combination of upwind soil uplift and bending of roots was found most likely to occur. For this failure mechanism, the roots are schematized as beams with a spring-support on the leeward side of the trunk. The roots are exposed to the weight of the overlying soil and the overturning moment. The model showed that an increase in the participation angle α or root diameter, or increase in root length results in larger stresses in the windward roots. The amount of uplift enlarges when the root diameter or root length increases or the participation angle decreases. The modulus of subgrade reaction and modulus of elasticity influence the distribution of the overturning moment over the leeward and windward roots. The largest difference between the moment inside the leeward and windward roots is found with a high modulus of elasticity or high modulus of subgrade reaction. This difference is in agreement with the contrasting reaction between soil types as stated in literature (Dupuy et al., 2007). The results show the dependence of the different failure mechanisms on soil and root properties, but also on the forest architecture. This research shows that the incorporation of mangrove stability in wave attenuation models cannot be neglected. Using an effective stress a proach, instead of a total stress approach as in this thesis, would provide extra information, such as soil behaviour in time during loading. It is therefore recommended to measure pore pressures under static or cyclic loading, resulting in the progression of the effective stress over time. The inclusion of more accurate soil descriptions would enable reducing uncertainty in nature-based solutions and enables to describe the soil-root reaction to loading over time.

AB  - Mangroves are well-recognized for their very high carbon sequestration potential. However, studies on their role in global carbon cycling and climate change are hindered due to lack of operational methodologies to model and map their biophysical properties. This study establishes a robust methodological protocol for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation using i) field measurements, ii) a generic (in the absence of species-specific) allometric equation, iii) multi-sensor/polarization SAR data and derived variables thereof, and iv) machine learning models; that demonstrated high prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.93) and low uncertainty (mean ≤ 3% and median ≤ 1.5%) for a mangrove forest. Following stratified random sampling and on-field accessibility criteria, we laid out 314 elementary sampling points of 0.04 ha each at Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary (BWS), India and measured circumference at breast height (CBH) and canopy tree height for 18 species. The estimated AGB range of a generic allometric equation was 9–474 Mg/ha for BWS, with a major representation of 9–347 Mg/ha. We utilized Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and derived their variables for AGB prediction. Compared to single sensor-based model, we observed higher prediction accuracy for combined sensor data (R2 = 0.63, 0.87, 0.93; RMSE = 66.75, 39.95, 28.35 Mg/ha; MAE = 52.63, 24.21, 19.55 Mg/ha; and Bias = 3.42, 0.22, 2.15 Mg/ha for C, L and C & L bands respectively using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) over Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The higher uncertainty pixels represented seasonal grassland and scrubs in the swampy areas and along the fringes of the creeks that experience diurnal tidal fluctuations. This robust methodology can be replicated for AGB estimates in other mangrove ecosystems to meet the operational carbon accounting requirements of various entities.

Although they are rarely the subject of tailored legal protection, there are some jurisdictions where the ecosystem services provided by mangroves are recognised in law and policy frameworks. This article focuses on Indo-Pacific island states to highlight the ways in which mangroves have been treated in law in these nations, and to make suggestions for how Indo-Pacific island states could enhance their conservation and management.

AB  - Mangroves are known to provide many ecosystem services, however there is little information on their potential role to cap and immobilise toxic levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). Using an Australian case study, we investigated the capacity of planted mangroves (Avicennia marina) to immobilise TPH within a small embayment (Stony Creek, Victoria, Australia) subjected to minor oil spills throughout the 1980s. Mangroves were planted on the oil rich strata in 1984 to rehabilitate the site. Currently the area is covered with a dense mangrove forest. One-meter-long sediment cores revealed that mangroves have formed a thick (up to 30 cm) organic layer above the TPH-contaminated sediments, accumulating on average 6.6 mm of sediment per year. Mean TPH levels below this organic layer (30–50 cm) are extremely toxic (30,441.6 mg kg−1), exceeding safety thresholds up to 220-fold which is eight times higher when compared to top layer (0–10 cm).

AB  - Mangroves are increasingly recognized for their role in supporting adaptation to climate change and variability. However, knowledge about how climate change and variability affect mangrove ecosystem services (MES) and their role in supporting coastal communities to adaption is limited in Tanzania. We used participatory rural appraisal methods and field observations to explore local communities' perceptions of climate change and variability, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies in the mangroves of the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania. Decrease in rainfall, increased temperatures, coastal flooding, and the incidence of sea level rise were identified as key variables associated with a changing climate in the delta. Perceived climatic stresses included damaged fish breeding sites, altered climate regulation and a decrease in coastal protection and flood control. Decline in crop, fish and honey production were perceived as the main impacts on community livelihoods, although there were significant differences across occupational groups. Dependence on MES in times of shocks, such as when agriculture production fails, switching of occupation, crop diversification, fishing in deep waters and migration to other areas provided potential adaptation options. Although the reported perceptions related to climate change or variability are not explicit, they both have negative consequences to mangrove dependent communities' livelihoods.

AB  - Mangroves are increasingly being degraded in West Africa. We explored local utilization, threats and assessed existing conservation practices in Ghana through field visits, mapping, laboratory analyses and interviews. The study reports three species of mangroves along Ghana’s coastline; white (Avicennia germinans), red (Rhizophora racemosa), and black (Laguncularia racemosa) mangroves. White mangrove is the most dominant, with black mangroves being the least. The current mangrove cover of Ghana was estimated at 72.4 km2 with over 18 million trees (average = 2284.21 trees per hectare), both naturally occurring and planted mangroves. The Volta Region had the most abundant mangroves, with the Central region recording the least. Notable flora within the mangrove forests included Acrostichum aureum, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Paspalum vaginatum, Sporobolus maritima and Conocarpus erectus. Mangrove wetland in Ghana provides suitable nursery habitats for several important fish species, including Sarotherodon melanotheron, Mugil cephalus, Callinectes amnicola, Cardiosoma armatum, Crassostrea sp, Periophthalmus papilio, Coptodon spp. Ghana’s mangrove forest is declining at a rate of 8.1 km2 per annum due to over-cutting, land conversion, wildfires, pollution, overgrazing and natural death from disease. Over cutting mangrove for fish smoking and housing construction were significant threats to mangroves nationwide. Continuous education, law enforcement, nature-based methods and local control mechanisms effectively protect mangroves.

AB  - Mangroves are globally recognized for their ecological, economic, social, and cultural importance. They provide a variety of goods and services to humanity. Mangroves are a group of trees and shrubs sheltered in the intertidal zones of tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions of the planet. They are adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions such as salinity, waterlogging, and inundation. They also are one of the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems on earth as they support the existence of a large number of organisms. Despite multiple goods and ecological services they deliver, mangrove ecosystems are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems because of several threats such as overexploitation, conversion, and encroachment of mangrove habitats for agricultural and settlement purposes, a decline in freshwater and silt deposition, heavy metal pollution, global warming, and sea level rise. This chapter provides important recent developments in the mangrove distribution, species diversity, diverse goods and services that they provide, threats to their survival, policies and global initiatives for their conservation, and challenges associated with conservation and restoration programs.

AB  - Mangroves are essential for reducing the vulnerability of many coastal communities to the impacts of climate change and increasingly intense and frequent extreme weather events. Yet climate change itself presents a significant threat to mangroves that could undermine their value in reducing this vulnerability. To maximize opportunities for disaster risk reduction (DRR), conservationists and disaster risk managers must pay careful attention to the threats that are driving the rapid loss of mangroves globally and their capacity to survive in a changing climate. This article presents the factors that should be considered when evaluating the value of mangrove ecosystems for DRR in a changing climate. It recommends further research, collaboration and coordination among the humanitarian, land use planning, conservation, climate change adaptation, development, and disaster management sectors to enable better-informed decisions on the use of mangroves for DRR.

AB  - Mangroves are a very diverse group of specialized coastal trees or shrubs that are adapted to the marine environment and inhabit highly productive inter-tidal ecosystems in the tropics and subtropics providing critical goods and services to coastal communities and contributing to global climate change mitigation owing to substantial carbon stocks. The inter-tidal areas are harsh environments between land and sea, subject to both high and low rainfall, hot and cold temperatures, variable amounts of freshwater oxygen and salt, and soils that can be pure clay or mixed with sand, silt, coral rubble or rock. These variations in chemical and physical factors influence mangrove ecosystems to display extreme diversity in plant composition, forest structure and growth rates (Manivawie (1998) An introduction manual on the biology and restoration of mangrove ecosystem. MIRC).

AB  - Mangrove-mud coasts across the world erode because of uninformed management, conversion of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds, development of infrastructure and urbanization, and/or extraction of groundwater inducing land subsidence. The accompanied loss of ecosystem values, amongst which safety against flooding, has far reaching consequences for coastal communities, exacerbated by sea-level rise. To halt erosion various nature-based solutions have been implemented as an alternative to hard infrastructure sea defenses, including mangrove planting and erection of low-tech structures such as bamboo fences, permeable brushwood dams, etc. These structures have been designed on the basis of best-engineering practice, lacking sufficient scientific background. This paper investigates the use and success of permeable dams over a period of about 15 years, describing their application in Guyana, Indonesia, Suriname, Thailand and Vietnam, summarizing the lessons-learned, and analyzing their functioning in relation to the physical-biological coastal system. Also an overview of relevant costs is given. The basic philosophy behind the construction of permeable dams is the rehabilitation of mangrove habitat through re-establishment of the (fine) sediment dynamics – we refer to Building with Nature as the overarching principle of this approach. Our main conclusions are that a successful functioning of permeable dams requires (1) a thorough understanding of the physical-biological system and analysis of the relevant processes, (2) patience and persistence, including maintenance, as the natural time scales to rehabilitate mangrove green belts take years to decades, and (3) intensive stakeholder involvement. We give a list of conditions under which permeable dams may be successful, but in qualitative terms, as local site conditions largely govern their success or failure.

AB  - Mangrove has high primary productivity, which supports land or sea ecosystems, especially in a protected area. Therefore, mangrove management is needed to maintain mangrove quality and productivity. The objective of the research is to evaluate the mangrove ecosystem, thus from the evaluation, we may build the strategy for environmental protection. The Evaluation Mangrove ecosystem on Leuweung Sancang Forest in Garut Regency West Java based on Species Importance Value and Diversity Index according to Minister of Environment Regulation Number 201/2004. Based on the results, we found two types of mangrove vegetation. True mangrove vegetations were Avicennia sp and Rhizophora sp. and associated mangroves include Thespesia sp, Mangifera sp. and Pandanus sp. Based on Minister of Environment Regulation Number 201/2004, the true species of mangroves that are Avicennia sp. and Rhizophora sp. are classified as destructing (rare). According to the Species Importance Index, we found that the highest was Rhizophora sp. and the least was Pandanus sp. Total Diversity Index was 0.33, which mean that the mangrove community is unstable. Strategy for environmental protection including building regulation, community development, mangrove rehabilitation and management.

AB  - Mangrove forests, that often act as natural coastal defences, enormously suffered due to ongoing climate change and human disturbances. Thus, it is necessary to have a countermeasure to mitigate the loss of mangroves. Wooden fences are becoming a viable nature-based solution to protect vulnerable replanted mangrove forests. However, the wooden fence's hydraulic characteristics are not yet fully understood due to the complication of branches arrangement. In the present study, a small-scale fence was tested in a wave flume to investigate the wave damping by wooden fences. The inner branches of the fence had the same inhomogeneous arrangement as used in earlier flow-resistance experiments. The physical model results indicate that the wooden fence is highly effective on wave transmission and that the effectiveness in wave reduction depends on the relative fence thickness, ??/???? . To understand the scale effect on wave transmission further, the numerical model SWASH was used with the laboratory wave data. By applying the prior experiments' drag coefficient on steady flow, the uncalibrated numerical model gave a good agreement with the wave model results, with a root-meansquare error for the total transmitted wave heights of 4.7%. After validation, potential scale effects for small scale tests were determined from scaling simulations at both full scales and the applied 1:5 model scale. These simulations were performed for a fence porosity of 0.81, and different fence thicknesses to understand scale effects between model- and full-scale. Both wave reflection and transmission at model-scale are about 5% higher than full-scale results due to the increased drag coefficient and viscous effects. The effects of fence thickness and porosity were the same in large and small scale, and much larger than the error due to scale effects. Hence testing fence efficiency at physical small scale is regarded as a useful tool, together with numerical modelling.

AB  - Mangrove forests with complex root systems contribute to increased coastal protection through drag effects. Previous flume studies proposed a predictive model of drag in Rhizophora mangrove forests based on quadratic drag law. However, its general applicability on mangrove forests in the field has not been tested. To fill this knowledge gap, this study quantified drag in a 17-year-old planted Rhizophora mangrove forest using a comprehensive measurement of hydrodynamics and vegetation morphology. The vegetation projected area density, a, showed an approximate exponential increase towards the bed, mainly due to root branching. This vertical variation led to enhanced vegetation drag per unit water volume relative to velocity with decreasing water depth. Alternatively, the drag per vegetation projected area solely depended on the square of velocity, indicating association with the quadratic drag law. The derived drag coefficient (CD) was 1.0 ± 0.2 for tide-driven currents, consistent with previous flume studies. By using the mean value of derived CD (1.0), it was confirmed that the quadratic drag model expresses well the field-measured drag. We also presented a method for predicting a value for a, another unknown parameter in the drag model, using an empirical Rhizophora root model, and confirmed a successful prediction of a and drag. Therefore, the drag in a Rhizophora mangrove forest can be accurately predicted only using the input parameters of the Rhizophora root model – stem diameter and tree density. This provides insights into effectively implementing the drag model in hydrodynamic models for better representation of mangroves’ coastal protection function.

AB  - Mangrove forests provide a multitude of ecosystem services, many of which contribute to Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) along tropical coastlines. In the face of rapid deforestation, Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been heralded as a potential avenue for financing conservation, although PES schemes remain in an embryonic state for mangroves. Several challenges must be overcome if mangrove PES is to advance. Firstly, challenges exist in quantifying multiple ecosystem services, especially those that contribute to DRR, such as wave attenuation and the control of coastal erosion. Secondly, the permanence of quantified ecosystem services is a central tenet of PES, but is not guaranteed in the dynamic coastal zone. Mangroves are affected by multiple stressors related to natural hazards and climate change, which are often outside of the control of a PES site manager. This will necessitate Financial Risk Management strategies, which are not commonly used in coastal PES, and introduces a number of management challenges. Finally, and most importantly, PES generally requires the clear identification and pairing of separate service providers and service users, who can potentially overlap in the context of DRR. This chapter reviews and discusses these emerging issues, and proposes potential solutions to contribute to the more effective implementation of mangrove PES. Ultimately however, difficulties in pairing separate and discreet service providers and users may render PES for DRR unfeasible in some settings, and we may need to continue traditional modes of DRR finance such as insurance and donor support.

AB  - Mangrove forests are remarkably diverse and productive ecosystems, with distinctive biophysical environments in intertidal coastal regions of the tropics and subtropics. In these regions, shrimp cultivation is identified as a profitable business and one of the main reasons for clearing of mangroves to construct shrimp farms. Against this backdrop and based on the first author's previous PhD research and other relevant scholarly works, in this commentary we discuss the aspects and contexts of the mangrove-based integrated shrimp farming system. Then, we recommend a model of co-management and a set of policy option towards sustainable silvo-aquaculture to protect/restore the mangrove forests and sustain shrimp production in coastal areas of Bangladesh. Mangroves and shrimp culture are not necessarily incompatible. Many mangrove species have been identified as beneficial for shrimp culture for a number of possible reasons. Most importantly, the nutrients in the leaf litter of several mangrove species have been found to enhance natural food production for shrimp. Besides the nutrient input, the leaf litter also provides surface area for biofilm development, on which different life stages of shrimp can graze. In addition, the combination of mangrove leaf litter and feed has been shown to enhance shrimp production synergistically. Additional economic benefits from mangrove-shrimp co-management include the production of timber (e.g. buildings, boats and fuel woods) and non-timber products (e.g. fruits, honey, fibers, firewood, resins and bark). Thus, mangrove-based aquaculture or silvo-aquaculture system can be considered as a nature-based solution to sustainably revitalize the economy in coastal areas where shrimp has been the economic mainstay. Though there are positive effects, we point out some potential negative impacts of mangrove-based shrimp culture, like the anti-nutrients content in the leaf litter, which might impact shrimp production. In addition, the long term use of mangrove leaf litter might degrade the water quality. Therefore, the co-management policy recommends a controlled practice of mangroves in shrimp culture to balance conservation of mangrove-based ecology and profitable shrimp production. The approach promotes nature-based solutions and fosters sustainable pathways for food production, considering socio-economic and environmental dynamics.

AB  - Mangrove forests are among the most productive ecosystems with important services such as food and livelihood provisions, recreations, and regulations (e.g., coastal protection) in local scales. At global scale, they are gaining salience for their carbon sequestration capacities, currently conceptualized as “blue carbon.” However, their essential benefits are reduced or lost when degraded. There is, therefore, a need to explore long-term mangrove cover change (MCC) and its underpinning drivers to develop sustainable management strategies. MCC has been analyzed extensively, including satellite images and field surveys, with drivers of changes frequently embedded in local contexts. Thus, in this study, MCC and the causal factors are evaluated at the local scale by gathering community perceptions in Eastern Samar, a typhoon-prone province in the Philippines, with a timeframe since the 1970s until the present. Results show that mangrove cover loss was observed following the occurrence of Typhoon Agnes in 1984 and Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 while conversion of mangrove areas to residential spaces was identified as a recurring driver of mangrove depletion from the early 1970s to 1990s. Study participants perceived that natural threats and lack of law enforcement were the leading proximate and underlying drivers of degradation, respectively. Respondents perceived that mangrove cover is increasing mainly due to successive reforestation programs coupled with stricter implementation of local ordinances in the sites. The results indicate the increased role of mangrove forests in disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation strategies, while the perceptions of drivers change in long terms.

AB  - Mangrove forests are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. However, there is still insufficient information available for strategic prediction of conservation and management intervention, particularly in the case of Mozambique. This country has the longest coastline and mangrove forests of Eastern Africa, but is prone to global climate hazards. Using recent field data and environmental parameters subjected to the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) collinearity test (bioclimatic variables, slop, salinity, land cover, and elevation), we ran MaxEnt to model the distribution of mangrove forests based on occurrence data of the most emblematic and representative mangrove species in Mozambique (Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata). Moreover, in order to understand which areas should be prioritized for management interventions on mangroves and costal dunes, an Exposure Index (EI) to climate hazards and erosion was compared with the potential distribution of these species. Our results showed that average wind speed of summer season, land surface elevation, Mean Diurnal Range, and saltwater exposure (salinity) were determinant on the distribution models of both species. The central coastal region of Mozambique (so-called swamp coast) presents the largest potentially suitable areas for mangroves species occurrence, having the highest levels of exposure. We also found that A. marina presents a higher EI than R. mucronata. The scarcity of studies concerning the central region of Mozambique; which was recently devastated by cyclone Idai (category four, 2019), which hit Mozambique and the neighbouring countries, reinforce the urgency for management intervention. The findings of this study should be used by managers and decision makers to promote best practices to safeguard lives and people's livelihoods and assets threatened by coastal climate hazards and anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems represent one of the most effective natural environments for fixing and storing carbon (C). Mangroves also offer significant co-benefits, serving as nurseries for marine species, providing nutrients and food to support marine ecosystems, and stabilizing coastlines from erosion and extreme events. Given these considerations, mangrove afforestation and associated C sequestration has gained considerable attention as a nature-based solution to climate adaptation (e.g., protect against more frequent storm surges) and mitigation (e.g. offsetting other C-producing activities). To advance our understanding and description of these important ecosystems, we leverage Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data to provide a current assessment of mangrove extent within the Red Sea region and also explore the effect of spatial resolution on mapping accuracy. We establish that Sentinel-2 provides a more precise spatial record of extent and subsequently use these data together with a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach to: i) map the distribution of Red Sea mangrove systems, and ii) identify potential areas for future afforestation. From these current and potential mangrove distribution maps, we then estimate the carbon sequestration rate for the Red Sea (as well as for each bordering country) using a meta-analysis of sequestration values surveyed from the available literature. For the mangrove classification, we obtained mapping accuracies of 98 %, with a total Red Sea mangrove extent estimated at approximately 175 km2. Based on the MaxEnt approach, which used soil physical and environmental variables to identify the key factors limiting mangrove growth and distribution, an area of nearly 410 km2 was identified for potential mangrove afforestation expansion. The factors constraining the potential distribution of mangroves were related to soil physical properties, likely reflecting the low sediment load and limited nutrient input of the Red Sea. The current rate of carbon sequestration was calculated as 1034.09 ± 180.53 Mg C yr−1, and the potential sequestration rate as 2424.49 ± 423.26 Mg C yr−1. While our results confirm the maintenance of a positive trend in mangrove growth over the last few decades, they also provide the upper bounds on above ground carbon sequestration potential for the Red Sea mangroves.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are widely distributed across Indonesia's shores and benefit coastal societies through their valuable ecosystem goods and services. These coastal forests sequester and store large amounts of atmospheric carbon as forms of biomass, necromass, and organic soil or sediment. This substantial carbon storage capacity is now being recognized and promoted in nature-based climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Over the past decade, we have conducted extensive assessments of mangrove carbon storage across the archipelago to understand mangrove's natural variation and response to various management regimes. Approximately 3 million ha of mangroves in Indonesia store more than 3 billion tons of carbon, however these ecosystems also face tremendous conversion pressure. Indonesian mangroves must therefore be managed innovatively to minimize further degradation and optimize ecosystem functions. Here, we summarize carbon stocks and sequestration across four different mangrove management regimes, namely protected, degraded, converted, and restored mangroves. Mangroves in Indonesia are able to recover from degradation, and sequester substantial amounts of carbon, between 1 and 10 tons (metric) C/ha/yr. Sediment accretion rates (SAR) between 4 and 6 mm/yr were also observed, potentially protecting low-lying coastal zones from susceptibility to contemporary sea-level rise and flooding. Existing information on the total economic valuation (TEV) of mangroves, which at the landscape scale can be up to USD 29 million, suggests that management regimes should also focus on the ecosystem goods and services provided by mangroves. Here we discuss a variety of management regimes that respond to the unique characteristics of the local mangrove setting, optimizing carbon sequestration and storage functions, and promoting conservation and restoration, so as to achieve sustainable livelihoods.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are made up of 70 species of salt tolerant plants1 covering more than 14 million hectares of tropical and subtropical coastal areas worldwide, in 123 countries and territories2. Although making up only 0.1% of the global landmass3, mangrove forests are some of the most productive and biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet. Occupying the intertidal zone between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, mangroves support a high diversity of flora and fauna of marine, estuarine, freshwater, and terrestrial species. Mangroves also deliver substantial ecosystem services that play a critical role in supporting human well-being through climate regulation, disaster risk reduction, food security, and poverty reduction. However, despite the benefits mangroves provide, they are being degraded and deforested at an alarming rate. In the past century, two-thirds of mangrove forests globally have been lost due to drivers including coastal development, aquaculture, agriculture, and climate change. The critical need to conserve, manage, and restore functioning mangrove forests and related coastal ecosystems is recognized in multiple international cross-cutting conventions and policy agreements including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are among the most economically and ecologically valuable marine environments in the world. Mangroves are effective at long-term carbon storage within their sediments and are estimated to hold 12 billion metric tons of carbon worldwide. These ecosystems are therefore vitally important for carbon sequestration and, by extension, climate change mitigation. As part of the Paris Agreement, participating countries agree to provide plans to reduce their carbon emissions, or nationally determined contributions (NDCs). However, despite mangroves being recognized as important nature-based solutions, many countries still lack national data on carbon stocks and must use global or regional averages, which may not be sufficiently accurate. Here, we present the national carbon stock estimate of mangrove ecosystems for the NDC of Belize, acquired through a collaborative approach involving government agencies and NGOs. We conducted a comprehensive sampling of mangroves across the country, including a range of mangrove ecotypes. The mean total ecosystem carbon stock (TECS) for the nation was 444.1 ± 21.0 Mg C ha−1, with 74.4 ± 6.2 Mg C ha−1 in biomass stocks, and 369.7 ± 17.7 Mg C ha−1 in sediment stocks. Combining these data with a recent mapping effort, we provide the first national comprehensive mangrove carbon stock estimate of 25.7 Tg C. The national mean from this study varies from previous global analyses, which can under- or overestimate TECS by as much as 0.6 Tg C and 16.5 Tg C, respectively, depending on the study. These data supported the NDC update of Belize, and can be used to inform the country's mangrove protection and restoration commitments. The collaborative approach of this work should serve as a blueprint for other countries seeking to conserve natural blue carbon sinks as a strategy to achieve their climate targets.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystem provides important services for coastal communities. Unfortunately, this ecosystem has undergone physical pressures for decades, including land conversion for shrimp aquaculture. Rehabilitation of the degraded mangroves offers an effective solution for bringing back mangrove functions, including carbon sequestration capacity. This study aims to quantify carbon stock (CS) and sequestration rate of a rehabilitated mangrove ecosystem in Indonesia, particularly in Banten Province. We compared sediment CS and carbon accumulation rate (CAR) of a rehabilitated mangrove in Ciseukeut, Panimbang, with a natural mangrove in Cilintang, the Ujung Kulon National Park. The sediment CS to a depth of 1 m in a rehabilitated mangrove in Ciseukeut was higher than in a natural mangrove in Cilintang, constituting 364 Mg C ha−1 and 126 Mg C ha−1, respectively. However, CAR showed the opposite pattern, in which a natural mangrove showed an almost two-fold higher rate (0.50 ± 0.42 Mg C ha−1 year−1) than that of a rehabilitated mangrove (0.27 ± 0.20 Mg C ha−1 year−1). Local hydrogeomorphological conditions play a role in affecting sediment CS and CAR in both sites. Enhancing hydrological modification can promote CAR, especially in an abandoned pond like in Ciseukeut. This study provided a knowledge base for suitable mangrove rehabilitation in the future that supports the Indonesian government's commitment to rehabilitating ca. 600,000 ha of degraded mangroves in Indonesia. Furthermore, the study also provides the first investigation of potential blue carbon for the world's natural heritage of the Ujung Kulon National Park.

AB  - Mangrove deforestation by land use conversions is the greatest threat to the conservation of coastal ecosystems, ranking Brazil as a country with high gross annual CO2 emissions. Despite the recognized socio-ecological importance in providing essential ecosystem services (e.g., erosion prevention, protection against extreme weather events, provision of habitats for estuarine species, and blue carbon storage), mangroves have been converted from blue carbon sinks to sources. Here, we modelled and evaluated the spatial-temporal changes in blue carbon stocks and net sequestration potential in mangrove forests in Santos and São Vicente, Brazil, from 1988 to 2050. We used classified images obtained from MapBiomas and the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon model, which quantifies the potential carbon sequestered in the study area based on changes in the land use and land cover over the determined study period. We found an increased trend in carbon stocks and net sequestration of mangroves in both municipalities. Over the analysis period, carbon stocks in the mangroves of the city of Santos increased 29% in total, while we found a smaller rise (14%) in São Vicente. We found that land use changed substantially during 1988 until 2018, with mangrove extent varying in the region from 3,375 ha in 1988 to 3,764 ha in 2018 within the entire study region. Overall, the net carbon sequestration was approximately 925,393 Mg CO2e and 287,130 Mg CO2e, in Santos and São Vicente, respectively, over a period from 1988 to 2050. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify soil carbon stock and accumulation in mangroves along an urban coastal landscape in Brazil and emphasizes the current and future role of mangroves in climate change mitigation. Our findings can support the development of public policies for mangrove conservation and restoration actions to mitigate climate impacts.

AB  - Managing and adapting to climate change in urban areas will become increasingly important as urban populations grow, especially because unique features of cities amplify climate change impacts. High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider disservices and co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB  - Mainstreaming coastal biodiversity certainly brings nature-based solutions for the conservation of offshore and onshore resources. Being an island, the long-term shoreline change of Sri Lanka is particularly important for management of the island’s coastal resources. This study was carried out at the southwestern and southern coasts of Sri Lanka to investigate the protective capacity of mangroves against coastal erosion, and coastal inundation hazards due to the climate associated sea-level rise. Structural diversity of mangrove stands was assessed in terms of alpha-diversity, plant species richness, basal area, tree height, density, and structural complexity index. Analysis of aerial photographs and the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model was used to identify shoreline changes along the southwestern and the southern coasts of Sri Lanka. Results revealed that by and large, the southwestern coast is highly vulnerable to coastal erosion and inundation hazards whereas the southern coast manifests a tendency to retreat. The average annual rate of shoreline change however varies within the two coastal areas, as there were accreting as well as eroding segments on both southern and southwestern coasts, nevertheless, all retreating beach segments were the sites of improper maritime developments. Segments with lower rates of shoreline erosion and coastal inundation hazards were found to be located close to the mangrove and other coastal vegetation with varying structural complexity and diversity. Reforestation and restoration of vegetation in coastal lagoons and estuarine habitats are evidently effective strategies not only to protect the low-lying coastal hinterlands but also to preserve coastal biodiversity.

AB  - Low-lying coastal zones are increasingly exposed to flood risks due to global change including sea level rise, increasing storm intensity and growing coastal population densities. Nature-based risk mitigation, by conservation or restoration of ecosystems, such as tidal wetlands (salt marshes and mangroves) that have the natural capacity to mitigate storm surge related flood risks, has been demonstrated by local to regional-scale studies, but yet, we currently lack globalscale assessments of where hotspots are located of large flood-exposed coastal areas and populations that can receive nature-based risk mitigation from tidal wetlands. Here we present the results of a global-scale GIS model assessing the worldwide contribution of tidal wetlands to coastal flood risks mitigation. It identifies the inland surface areas and population numbers receiving storm surge mitigation by mangrove forests and salt marshes, and it quantifies the distance travelled by a storm surge through tidal wetlands as a measure of the magnitude of storm surge mitigation. Results show that on a worldwide scale, about 30 % of the flood-exposed low-lying coastal plain benefit from nature-based storm surge mitigation by tidal wetlands, with the largest areas located in deltas, estuaries and lagoons (e.g. Mississippi delta, Elbe estuary, Venice Lagoon). About 40 % of the global flood-exposed coastal population receives nature-based storm surge mitigation. The majority of that population (80 %) is located in five countries, i.e. China, Vietnam, the Netherlands, India and Indonesia. Areas more exposed to extreme storm surges (Eastern America, Caribbean Sea, Eastern Asia) include hotspot areas where storm surges are travelling through wider tidal wetlands generating higher mitigation, as for example in the Mississippi delta, Chesapeake bay, Ganges-Brahmaputra delta or Yangtze delta. Our global scale assessment aims to increase general awareness on the high capacity of nature-based flood risk mitigation, and to inspire further local scale analyses in support of the wider application of nature-based risk mitigation as a sustainable strategy to mitigate increasing coastal flood risks around the world.

Local to regional-scale studies have demonstrated that conservation or restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems, such as salt marshes and mangroves, provides nature-based risk mitigation, as these wetlands have the natural capacity to mitigate the impacts of storm surges and related flood risks. Yet, it is unknown how important this nature-based mitigation of coastal flood risks is on a global scale. Here we present the results of a global-scale GIS model assessing the global distribution of inland surface areas and population numbers exposed to storm surges that would first propagate through tidal wetlands before they reach the inhabited land, and hence that would receive storm surge mitigation by the mangrove forests and salt marshes. Further our model quantifies the distance travelled by a storm surge through the tidal wetlands as a measure of the magnitude of storm surge mitigation. Results show that on a worldwide scale, about 30% of the flood-exposed low-lying coastal plain benefits from nature-based storm surge mitigation by tidal wetlands, with the largest areas located in deltas (e.g. Pearl River, Yangtze, Mekong) and estuaries (e.g. Elbe). Areas protected by large wetlands, where a storm surge would first propagate through >5 km of tidal wetlands before it reaches vulnerable land and people, are located in river deltas such as of the Guayas (Ecuador), Mississippi (USA) and Ganges-Brahmaputra (India and Bangladesh). About 35% of the global flood-exposed coastal population receives nature-based storm surge mitigation. The majority of that population (80%) is located in five countries, i.e. China, Vietnam, the Netherlands, India and Germany. Areas more exposed to extreme storm surges (Eastern America, Caribbean Sea, Eastern Asia) include hotspot areas where storm surges are travelling through wider tidal wetlands generating higher risk mitigation, as for example in the Mississippi delta, Chesapeake bay, Ganges-Brahmaputra delta or Yangtze delta.

AB  - Living shorelines are nature-based solutions to coastal erosion that can be constructed as salt marshes with fringing oyster reefs. Each of these habitats can decrease the potential for eutrophication through increased nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification. However, the development of N cycling over time has not been studied in living shorelines. This research measured denitrification rates in a chronosequence of living shorelines spanning 0–20 years in age in Bogue Sound, NC. Analyses were conducted seasonally from summer 2014 to spring 2015 along an elevation transect through the salt marsh, oyster reef, and adjacent sandflat at all sites. Gas fluxes (N2 and O2) from sediment core incubations were measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) to assess denitrification and sediment oxygen demand. Fluxes of dissolved nutrients and the greenhouse gas N2O were measured. Sediment properties, inundation frequency, oyster filtration rates, and marsh grass stem density were also quantified. There was no significant difference in denitrification rates among habitats. N removal consistently increased from the 0- to 7-year-old sites. Denitrification efficiency was always greater than 50% and positive N2O fluxes were negligible. Our results suggest that living shorelines increase net N removal within a relatively short time period following construction, without introducing deleterious greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that living shorelines can play an important role in estuarine N cycling and management.

AB  - Living shorelines and other nature-based solutions have become more widely accepted as a cost-effective, multi-functional, and sustainable approach to coastal resilience. However, in spite of growing stakeholder support, a planning-level understanding of the hydrodynamic impact of living shorelines is not well-developed. Not only do these features vary in size, shape, and structural characteristics, but the wave environment in which they exist can be quiescent or extreme. The work presented in this paper explores the hydrodynamic effects of living shoreline features in such a way that can be generalized across a range of varying physical environments. In a series of Simulation WAves Nearshore (SWAN) simulations, we investigate the effect of wave period, wave height, bed slope, living shoreline feature length in the cross-shore direction, and feature friction coefficient on wave attenuation. Results showed that higher wave period, higher wave height, milder slopes, longer feature lengths, and higher feature roughness largely correlated with higher wave attenuation. However, only on mild slopes did additional feature lengths result in appreciable additional attenuation. Characteristic lengths were thus computed to better illustrate the cost-effectiveness of additional feature lengths given a particular wave environment. These characteristic lengths provide one way to evaluate the hydraulic efficacy of proposed living shoreline projects. In this way, regardless of the particularities of individual project sites, we aim to help planners screen potential living shoreline projects before pursuing more detailed, costly analyses.

AB  - Limited time and resources remain to constrain the climate crisis. Natural climate solutions represent promising options to protect, manage and restore natural lands for additional climate mitigation, but they differ in (1) the magnitude and (2) immediacy of mitigation potential, as well as (3) cost-effectiveness and (4) the co-benefits they offer. Counter to an emerging preference for restoration, we use these four criteria to propose a general rule of thumb to protect, manage and then restore lands, but also show how these criteria explain alternative prioritization and portfolio schemes. This hierarchy offers a decision-making framework for public and private sector actors to optimize the effectiveness of natural climate solutions in an environment in which resources are constrained, and time is short.

AB  - Leaf litter and its breakdown products represent an important input of organic matter and nutrients to mangrove sediments and adjacent coastal ecosystems. It is commonly assumed that old-grown stands with mature trees contribute more to the permanent sediment organic matter pool than younger stands. However, neither are interspecific differences in leaf decay rates taken into account in this assumption nor is our understanding of the underlying mechanisms or drivers of differences in leaf chemistry sufficient. This study examines the influence of different plant species and ontogenetic stage on the microbial decay of mangrove leaf litter. A litterbag experiment was conducted in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Malaysia, to monitor leaf litter mass loss, and changes in leaf litter chemistry and microbial enzyme activity. Four mangrove species of different morphologies were selected, namely the trees Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera parviflora, the fern Acrostichum aureum and the shrub Acanthus ilicifolius. Decay rates of mangrove leaf litter decreased from A. ilicifolius to R. apiculata to B. parviflora to A. aureum. Leaf litter mass, total phenolic content, protein precipitation capacity and phenol oxidase activity were found to decline rapidly during the early stage of decay. Leaf litter from immature plants differed from that of mature plants in total phenolic content, phenolic signature, protein precipitating capacity and protease activity. For R. apiculata, but not of the other species, leaf litter from immature plants decayed faster than the litter of mature plants. The findings of this study advance our understanding of the organic matter dynamics in mangrove stands of different compositions and ages and will, thus, prove useful in mangrove forest management.

AB  - Large, complex coastal regions often require a combination of interventions to lower the risk of flooding to an acceptable level. In practice, a limited number of strategies are considered and interdependencies between interventions are often simplified. This paper presents the Multiple Lines of Defence Optimization System (MODOS)‐model. This quick, probabilistic model simulates and evaluates the impact of many flood risk reduction strategies while accounting for interdependencies amongst measures. The simulation includes hydraulic calculations, damage calculations, and the effects of measures for various return periods. The application and potential of this model is shown with a conceptual and simplified case study, based on the Houston‐Galveston Bay area. The analyses demonstrate how the MODOS‐model identifies trade‐offs within the system and shows how flood risk, cost, and impact respond to flood management decisions. This improved understanding of the impact of design and planning choices can benefit the discussions in finding the optimal flood risk reduction strategy for coastal regions.

AB  - Large parts of the Australian coastline are surrounded by nearshore aquatic vegetation, such as kelp or seagrass. Although it is widely accepted that vegetation plays an important role in dissipating wave energy and reducing current magnitudes, there is a limited understanding on how this affects coastal morphology. Consequently, most coastal models can currently not account for this effect. The aim of this work is to assess the effect of flexible aquatic vegetation, kelp in particular, on sand dune erosion using a process-based model, XBeach. The model is validated with experimental data obtained from literature, showing that XBeach can accurately model the measured wave evolution. Moreover, the model is able to reproduce dune erosion volume reasonably well. To investigate the effectiveness of kelp in mitigating storm-induced erosion, a series of synthetic storm events were simulated for a beach in northern Tasmania (Australia) that has suffered from erosion in the past. Model scenarios were focused on climate change effects, such as sea level rise and change in kelp forest cover. The results of this modelling study suggest that, across a range of climate change scenarios and storm intensities, the presence of kelp may have a significant effect on coastal stability during storm events.

AB  - Large aquaculture systems may have the potential to damp wave energy for coastal protection. The performance of these systems are influenced by the dynamics of components such as flexible kelp blades and mussel droppers. In this thesis, the dynamics of kelp blades and mussel droppers were investigated with a consistent-mass cable model with focus on understanding the asymmetric motion of kelp blades. The results showed the asymmetric blade motion in symmetric waves is caused by the spatial asymmetry of the encountered wave orbital velocities due to blade displacements and the asymmetric action on the blade by vertical wave orbital velocities. For the kelp grown from the bottom, the asymmetry of blade motion provides ‘shelter’ that could inhibit sediment suspension and coastal erosion. For suspended kelp attached to a longline, the asymmetric motion would induce the kelp to roll over the attachment in large wave conditions. With understanding the blade dynamics, physical model experiments using the morphological and mechanical properties of the cultivated Saccharina latissima at Saco Bay, Maine in the USA were conducted to investigate the wave attenuation characteristics of suspended kelp farms. The results indicated that 20 longlines with 100 plants/m could reduce up to 23% energy of 6.3 s waves. To predict wave attenuation under wider conditions, numerical and analytical wave attenuation models coupled with blade motion were developed for regular and irregular waves. With the analytical model, a case study at a site in Northeastern US showed the potential of suspended aquaculture farms to dissipate wave energy in a storm event. Compared to naturally occurring submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), suspended aquaculture farms were found to perform better at attenuating shorter waves and less impacted by water level changes due to tides, surge and sea level rise. Implementing offshore aquaculture structures in conjunction with SAV-based living shorelines that can enhance the coastal defense of SAV-based living shorelines. This research is useful for the design of suspended aquaculture structures for nature-based coastal protection. The analytical wave attenuation models are also convenient to implement in large-scale models to analyze the influences of wave attenuation on coastal morphology.

AB  - Lack of public support for coastal adaptation can present significant barriers for implementation. In response, policy makers and academics are seeking strategies to build public support for coastal adaptation, which requires a deeper understanding of peoples’ preferences for coastal adaptation and what motives those preferences. Here, we conduct a systematic literature review to understand preferences for coastal adaptation options and the factors influencing these preferences. Ninety peer-reviewed publications meet the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that hard protection options were often the most frequently preferred, likely due to a desire to maintain current shoreline, for the protection of recreational spaces and private property, and a perceived effectiveness of hard protection options. Soft protection, including nature-based approaches, accommodation, and no action were the next most preferred options. Finally, retreat options were the least preferred, often due to strong place attachment. We identify twenty-eight factors that could influence preferences, with risk perception, place attachment, and financial considerations occurring most frequently in the literature. In the conclusion, we outline the most significant research gaps identified from our analysis and discuss the implication for adaptation research and practice.

AB  - La protection côtière est un service écosystémique (SE) des récifs coralliens extrêmement important, en particulier avec les impacts négatifs imminents et croissants du changement climatique mondial (GCC). Le SE de protection côtière n'a cependant pas retenu la même attention que celle portée à des SE plus « évidents » peut-être parce que les avantages du SE ne sont visibles que sur terre (pas en mer) et sont couplés à des défis dans son évaluation tels que la détermination précise du rôle du corail vivant dans la fourniture du service. Malgré ces défis, la contribution des récifs à la prestation des SE a été scientifiquement prouvée. Les récifs coralliens sont en déclin à l'échelle mondiale à cause des impacts locaux et mondiaux, exacerbés par un financement inadéquat et non durable de leur protection et gestion. Il est impératif que nous déterminions les méthodes les plus adaptées pour améliorer la santé des récifs, dans un monde où la situation est à la fois désastreuse et sensible au temps ; avec un délai estimé à moins de 50 ans pour agir. Un élément essentiel de toute solution est de savoir comment payer pour ces améliorations, à un moment où les méthodes de financement traditionnelles semblent insuffisantes et où un financement inadéquat est identifié comme un obstacle majeur au succès de la conservation. L'objectif de cette thèse est d'étudier des solutions à la fois écologiques et financières pour améliorer la santé des récifs coralliens et son SE de protection des côtes. Nous concentrons l'analyse sur la viabilité et le financement de récifs artificiels “gris-verts” avec des solutions de restauration des récifs coralliens visant à protéger les plages de l'érosion. Le chapitre 2. Du paper pose le « décor » des chapitres suivants. Les interventions écologiques et financières interviennent dans le cadre d'une Aire Marine Protégée (AMP). Le document a analysé les données de 2 nations insulaires et via des analyses coûts-avantages a fourni des preuves de l'attractivité de l'investissement dans les AMP pour protéger les SE. Le chapitre prochaine passe en revue ce que l'on sait de la protection côtière des récifs coralliens et détermine sa faisabilité pour un système de paiement pour les services écosystémiques (PSE). Au cours du processus, le rôle du corail vivant a été analysé et les actions de gestion identifiées qui pourraient améliorer la santé des récifs pour la prestation de services ont été identifiées. Ce document identifie la restauration des coraux comme une intervention clé pour la protection côtière et fournit la justification du chapitre 5. Le chapitre 5 explore plus en détail les moyens non publics de financement de la conservation marine via des investissements à impact et des financements mixtes. Ayant identifié qu'il est logique d'investir dans les AMP au chapitre 1, nous identifions le type de financement et proposons un mécanisme de financement pour l'investissement. Les sorties sont utilisées dans le chapitre 5Le chapitre 6 utilise les résultats des chapitres 4 et 5 et développe des solutions écologiques et financières pour la protection côtière. Dans cet article, nous démontrons l'impact positif de la restauration des récifs, proposons des options pour le faire et montrons l'additionnalité obtenue en utilisant de telles solutions basées sur la nature par rapport aux infrastructures grises traditionnelles pour atténuer l'érosion côtière. Le chapitre 7 synthétise les résultats des chapitres précédents et conclut que si la restauration n'est pas une solution « parfaite », c'est peut-être notre meilleure chance d'améliorer la santé des récifs pour la protection côtière. Le fardeau du financement de telles solutions - dont le coût varie considérablement - ne devrait pas incomber uniquement aux gouvernements et devrait être partagé avec le secteur privé, en particulier ceux qui bénéficient directement de la protection côtière.

AB  - Korean tidal flats are one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet, but their value has not been properly recognized. Thus, since the late 1970s, about 40% of Korea’s tidal flats have been converted through land reclamation. Some converted tidal flats have led to negative consequences, such as deteriorating water quality, diminished livelihoods of fishing communities, and inefficient use of national budgets. These are types of market failure. Knowing the potential market value of ecosystem services may correct these market failures. Recently, as the importance of blue carbon has increased, it is expected that coastal ecosystems that store carbon can better receive their full social value, including possible access to carbon markets. This report presents a methodology for estimating the economic value of tidal flats as a coastal carbon repository and its application to tidal flat conservation policies. Korea’s tidal flats store carbon that accounts for 8% of Korea’s annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. To estimate the net benefit of tidal flat conservation, a cost-benefit analysis that included carbon dioxide reduction values was conducted for Ganghwa tidal flat. With a 25-year time horizon, the break-even point between benefit and cost occurs when the carbon price is $ 4 – 6/tCO 2 e. Given the average carbon market price in 2018 in Korea is $20.62/tCO 2 e, the ‘blue carbon’ valuation is high enough to incentivize coastal wetlands conservation, and climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Based on this blue carbon ‘viability,’ this paper examines some related issues and legislative improvements, as well as future considerations to increase participation by the private sector.

AB  - Kenya has made several initiatives to support restoration of lost and degraded mangrove forest areas along the coast. The initiatives have involved both mangrove reforestation and natural regeneration. This study investigated the effectiveness and the outcome of mangrove restoration programs along the Kenyan coast. It mapped the location of the project sites, areal extent, and evaluated success indicators, underlying challenges, and community perception towards mangrove restoration. The study adopted vegetation and social survey methods. Square plots of 10 x 10m were randomly established on reforested areas in order to assess the growth performance of replanted mangroves. Purposive sampling was used in questionnaire administration for social surveys. Arc GIS software was used to develop a geolocation map; whilst MINITAB software and Shannon Wiener diversity index (H) formula were used for statistical and diversity analysis, respectively. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software was employed for analysis of social survey data through descriptive statistics. A total of 107 respondents including 7 key informants were interviewed. A total of 19 project areas with a total of 53 replanted sites were surveyed; translating to an estimated area of 93.5 ha of replanted mangroves. Rhizophora mucronata and Ceriops tagal were the most preferred mangrove species reforestation. The survival rate of surveyed plantations ranged from 0 – 97.8% (mean 55.4±31.2%). Sites with high survival rates (>80%) included Mikindani, Jomvu Kuu, and Pate, while some sites in Mwache, Kiwegu, Jimbo recorded more than 90% mortality. Failure of restoration success was attributed to species mismatch, change in site conditions as well as biophysical disturbances while successes saw the application of best practices and good governance. Stocking rates of 5 – 24-year-old mangrove plantations ranged from 3575 – 7825 stems/ha; with Mean Annual Increment (MAI) of height, diameter and biomass estimated of 0.34m/yr (range: 0.11 – 0.57m/yr), 0.35cm/yr (range: 0.12 – 0.52cm/yr) and 5.96t/ha/yr (range: 2.02 – 15.67t/ha/yr) respectively. Natural recruitment in reforested areas ranged from 175 – 7150 saplings/ha (mean: 2081 saplings/ha) while the biodiversity index (H) of macrofauna (crabs and mollusks) was between 1.60 – 1.87. Ecological and economic benefits were the main factors that motivated local communities to participate in restoration activities. To ensure future restoration success, this study emphasizes the need to apply principles of ecological mangrove restoration, strengthen stakeholders’ participation, incentivize restoration activities as well as promote long-term monitoring of replanted mangrove sites. This will accelerate the achievement of the local and national priorities of the United Nations Decade (2021-2030) on Ecosystem Restoration.

AB  - Kelp forests line a quarter of the world’s coastlines and provide diverse ecosystem services. While kelps are a harvested resource themselves, they are also foundation species that form the basis of productive ecosystems. Globally, kelps are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic impacts, including overharvesting, overgrazing, invasive species, poor water quality, and the direct and indirect effects of climate change. To address these threats and preserve the services provided by these foundation species, we show that Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) approaches are well-suited for kelp forest management. To define and illustrate key EBM-inspired approaches for kelp forest management and conservation, we combined key concepts from the EBM literature, the literature on the biology and ecology of kelp forests, and primary information we gathered on case studies of ongoing kelp forest management at regional levels in British Columbia (Canada), California (United States), and northern Chile. Using these three sources of information, we identify six key principles for kelp forest EBM: 1) monitoring at biologically relevant temporal and spatial scales, 2) assessing and addressing cumulative impacts, 3) managing across spatial and institutional scales, 4) co-management with users, 5) employing rapid adaptive management and/or the precautionary principle, and 6) managing food web connections. We explore and illustrate these principles using examples from multiple regions to provide concrete guidance on EBM-inspired strategies that are likely to improve kelp forest management outcomes.

AB  - Kelp forests and seagrasses are important carbon sinks that are declining globally. Rewilding the sea, through restoring these crucial habitats, their related biodiversity and ecosystem contributions, is a movement and concept, gathering pace in the United Kingdom and globally. Yet understanding of the economic costs and benefits for setting areas of the sea aside—and removing some human impacts from them—is not well understood. The potential benefits and distributional impacts on marine users and wider society is critical to make evidence based decisions. Ensuring that areas of the sea recover, and that the impacts (both positive and negative) are understood, requires targeted research to help guide decisions to optimize the opportunity of recovery, while minimizing any negative impacts on sea users and coastal communities. We approach the problem from an ecosystem services perspective, looking at the opportunity of restoring a kelp bed in Sussex by removing fishing activity from areas historically covered in kelp. Development of an ecosystem services valuation model showed restoring kelp to its highest mapped past extent (96% greater, recorded in 1987) would deliver a range of benefits valued at over £ 3.5 million GBP. The application of an ecosystem services approach enabled the full range of benefits from habitat restoration to be assessed. The results and the gaps identified in site specific data and values for this area, have broader implications in fisheries management and natural resource management tools for restoring marine habitats and ecosystems in the United Kingdom.

AB  - Jamaica, like other Caribbean and island nations is at high risk from coastal flooding and related hazards. Vulnerable coastal communities in Jamaica receive significant flood protection benefits from natural habitats like mangroves and coral reefs, even though these habitats are threatened by human development and activity and by natural stressors such as sea-level rise and climate change. As coastal flooding and habitat loss increase, there is great imperative among national disaster risk reduction agencies, conservation agencies and international aid institutions in Jamaica, to quantify the economic value of conserving and restoring mangrove habitats for risk reduction and to thereby inform national risk reduction, climate adaptation and conservation plans. This technical report provides an ecological, economic and social assessment of the habitat status, risks, costs and flood protection benefits of mangroves in Jamaica with a focus on their role in coastal flood risk reduction. This work aims to support decisions for sustainable and cost-effective approaches for mangrove management and flood risk reduction. First, authors assess the current status and recent trends in the distribution of mangroves in Jamaica. We then review the costs of restoration mangrove projects across Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. Using connected assessments, authors consider the nationwide restoration potential for mangroves. The authors then focus on a rigorous nationwide assessment of flood risk and the risk reduction benefits of mangroves to people and property across Jamaica.

AB  - Jamaica, like most Small Island Developing States around the world, is at high risk of coastal hazards due to its exposure to tropical storms, high levels of coastal development, vulnerable coastal communities, and the predicted impacts of climate change. Environmental degradation has been linked to increased vulnerability to disasters. Nature-based Solutions, although not formally present in the literature, are being implemented at various scales in Jamaica. This paper presents an overview of three marine and coastal Nature-based Solutions being utilised in the country: protected area management (Special Fishery Conservation Areas); mangrove restoration; and coral restoration. The paper briefly reviews their current application in Jamaica before arguing that these conservation projects that traditionally focused on biodiversity have co-benefits as Nature-based Solutions for disaster resilience. The paper closes by outlining several research objectives that should be explored in the future to further the implementation of Nature-based Solutions for disaster resilience in Jamaica.

AB  - IUCN today unveiled a Global Standard providing the first-ever set of benchmarks for nature-based solutions to global challenges. The new IUCN Global Standard will help governments, business and civil society ensure the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and maximise their potential to help address climate change, biodiversity loss and other societal challenges on a global scale. “The world is looking for durable and effective options to tackle global challenges such as climate change, food and water security, and now, economic recovery from the global pandemic. To this end, the new IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions is ideally placed to harness and accelerate the sustainable use of nature,” said IUCN’s Global Director for the Nature-based Solutions Group Stewart Maginnis. “For nature-based solutions to fulfil their potential, we must ensure that the actions put in place today bring about the desired benefits for society and biodiversity. This Global Standard offers a rigorous, consistent and accountable framework that will help avoid any misuse and take nature-based solutions from the local to global scale.” The concept of nature-based solutions (NbS) – actions addressing key societal challenges through the protection, sustainable management and restoration of ecosystems, benefiting both biodiversity and human well-being – is increasingly being applied around the world. More than 130 countries have already included NbS actions – such as reforestation, green infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and aquaculture, or coastal protection – in their national climate plans under the Paris Agreement. However, not all actions labelled as “nature-based solutions” provide the anticipated benefits to both society and biodiversity, and the global potential of NbS is far from being fully realised. “Until now, there has been neither consensus nor coherent guidance on how to design and implement nature-based solution interventions that are capable of consistent delivery of benefits for people and nature,” said Angela Andrade, Chair of the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management, which helped lead the development of the Global Standard. “The contribution of the Commission, in addition to input from over 800 experts and practitioners from 100 countries, has been to guide the development of the IUCN Global Standard, ensuring that it is scientifically robust and applicable across a wide range of regions and scenarios.” “There is no shortage of evidence of the impacts of climate on our natural systems, as well as the consequences of nature loss for climate. So the launch of a global standard for nature-based solutions is a very welcome development," said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Global Leader of Climate & Energy at WWF. "We believe it will not only help spotlight nature’s many contributions to societal challenges, including the climate crisis, but also strengthen confidence in the concept of nature-based solutions. We expect the standard will no doubt help with more effective on the ground implementation and link finance to the most valuable projects. It will also facilitate the much needed connection of international and domestic climate and nature commitments and processes in order to mainstream nature-based solutions.” The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions has eight criteria and associated indicators that allow the user to assess the aptness, scale, economic, environmental and social viability of an intervention; consider its possible trade-offs; ensure transparency and adaptive project management; and explore possible linkages to international targets and commitments. It consists of a user guide and self-assessment tool, which identifies areas for improving and learning.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly clear that Caribbean islands are very vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as sea level rise, longer periods of droughts, loss of biodiversity, more extreme weather events (flooding and hurricanes), and increased freshwater demands. Addressing these issues encourages good climate change adaptation governance. So far, however, the literature has not discussed what good governance could mean in this context. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to address this knowledge gap by developing an assessment framework and showing its usefulness. The framework is based on a review of the literature and is applied in an assessment of adaptation practices in Curaçao. The assessment is based on a review of Curaçao policy documents and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. We found that the developed framework was useful for obtaining a better insight into the quality of adaptation governance on Caribbean islands, and that in the Curaçao practices, the good governance principles of transparency and inclusiveness are better elaborated in comparison to connectivity, accountability and government effectiveness. We conclude the paper with some reflections on the potential of the framework and some suggestions for further research.

AB  - It has been widely documented that coral reefs play a very important role in the dissipation of wave energy. Observations of beach morphology, made before and after a major hurricane that hit SE Mexico in October 2005 (Wilma), show widespread erosion at an exposed beach (Cancun), but unexpected beach accretion 25 km south at a beach fronted by a fringing reef (Puerto Morelos). The DELFT 3D morphodynamic model is used at a regional scale to explain the divergent morphological behavior of both beaches and explore the processes involved at both sites. A combination of offshore transport at the exposed beach, large scale southward sediment transport and onshore transport along the reef protected beaches seems to be the main explanation for the observed morphological behavior. Dune erosion and beach face sand relocation are also partially responsible for the beach progradation at the reef protected site.

AB  - Island nations and islands in Oceania and the Asia Pacific rely heavily on coastal and marine ecosystem services. Systems such as coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves are intrinsically important, vital to many people’s livelihoods, and in many cases intertwined with cultural systems. Some, such as the reefs of the Coral Triangle, are seriously threatened by fishing pressures, including destructive fishing practices, pollution and environmental change. Governments, and concerned coastal communities, each try to work to protect or manage the exploitation of important ecosystems, yet apart from the limited cases with endorsed systems of co-management or community based management, communities and governments can find themselves working separately and not necessarily in harmony. A participatory diagnosis on the island of Selayar, Eastern Indonesia, highlights opportunities for communities and government to improvement alignment of their efforts towards sustainable management of marine ecosystems. The findings from this study can inform strategies in Oceania and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific towards improved management of marine and coastal ecosystems, from the standpoints of communities, government and civil-society actors. We highlight issues of policy alignment between communities and government; aligning customary and science-based knowledge; and navigating inter-community conflict.

AB  - Introduction: Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) was devastated by Hurricane Michael in October 2018. Due to its critical geographic position on the Gulf of Mexico and its value as an economic engine in Northwest Florida, the Air Force vowed to rebuild the base as the Installation of the Future. Improved standards for flood elevation and wind speed are guiding new construction. The landscape master plan elements in Tyndall AFB’s Installation Facilities Standards promote sustainable development, multimodal mobility, and enhanced stormwater management. Nature-based coastal resilience pilot projects have been conceived and funding is being secured from an engaged stakeholder community. Restoring a dynamic coastline after a shock as severe as Hurricane Michael is complex and takes time, energy, and resources. Recovery solutions require both human intervention (such as dune restoration, living shoreline construction, and marsh enhancement) and natural processes. This guide provides an overview of the frameworks and strategies intended to improve the area’s natural coastal defenses against extreme weather threats, reduce exposure of surrounding infrastructure, and protect surrounding infrastructure from crippling storm surge and flooding. This document presents concepts and strategies for achieving coastal resilience and sustainability at Tyndall AFB. The strategies in this document are predecisional and address elements of resilience beyond coastal storm surge, and including erosion mitigation, rainfall-driven flooding, water quality and integration of all these elements achieving resilience and sustainability outcomes. Although the strategies don’t represent recommendations for specific locations, they do point to areas of opportunity for resilience and sustainability

AB  - Introduction: To accelerate progress and delivery of Nature-Based Solutions for application in navigation, flood risk management, water operations, and ecosystem restoration the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), through its Engineering With Nature® (EWN) initiative, has engaged in a collaborative effort with The Water Institute of the Gulf (the study team) to conduct policy research for fully evaluating the benefits of Nature-Based Solutions (inclusive of Natural Infrastructure, Natural1 and Nature Based Features (USACE, 2021) and related terms). Throughout this document, these techniques are referred to using the umbrella term “Nature-Based Solutions” (NBS). This document is the second in a series of reports produced as part of this collaborative effort. This report describes the process used to inventory a set of completed water resources planning studies. These studies were scored by USACE subject matter experts based, in part, on the level of consideration of NBS included as a part of the plan formulation and evaluation process. A subset of six planning studies (“case studies”) were ultimately identified through this process to be carried forward and used to evaluate other potential technical approaches for evaluating benefits from NBS. This report summarizes results of the scoring process and describes key steps and decisions that informed the final case study selection.

AB  - Introduction: This study focuses on the policy response of six study states—California, Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington—to restore or protect four critical and threatened habitats: oyster reefs or beds, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses. These coastal ecosystems, which exist in salt, fresh, and brackish waters along coastlines, provide structurally complex nurseries, shelters, and habitats for a myriad of commercially and culturally significant aquatic species, and other important ecosystem services (Barbier 2013). The study examined the selected six states to capture the diversity of geography, restoration and protection policies, and sources of environmental degradation across the country. The study examined the four coastal habitats because of their historic and current extent along the coastal United States, economic and cultural relevance, and importance in maintaining key ecosystem services including food provision, recreation, coastal resilience, and more.

AB  - Introduction: This compendium presents nature-based and ‘grey’ solutions to address climate- and water-related challenges in European cities. It focuses on the six challenges that are most common across European cities and which can be addressed through nature-based solutions: heat stress, river flooding, surface water (or pluvial) flooding, coastal flooding, water scarcity, and poor water quality. The solutions were identified through a review of existing databases and collections – such as the Natural Water Retention Measures (NWRM) catalogue1 , Climate-ADAPT2 , the Danish portal for Climate Change Adaptation3 , and the (draft) RESIN Adaptations Options Library4 – as well as various reports and scientific publications. Tables 1 and 2 overleaf present the set of solutions identified and the corresponding climate and water hazards they can tackle. The remainder of the compendium consists of solution-specific fact sheets explaining what each solution entails, the problems – or hazards – it can address, its typical co-benefits, and a brief review of evidence regarding the solution’s effectiveness and costs. Table 3 provides an overview of the main functions and co-benefits of the 36 nature-based solutions examined, based on literature review and expert judgement.

AB  - Introduction: The oceans absorb around 30% of anthropogenically produced carbon globally, as well as converting between 50-70% of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) into oxygen via algal photosynthesis1,2,3. United Kingdom (UK) waters (not including overseas territories) are ~3.5 times greater in area than the land mass4 , meaning NbS in the ocean could play a very significant role as a carbon sink in the UK’s carbon budget. This chapter reviews the carbon sequestration potential of marine habitats (often referred to as Blue Carbon), alongside the benefits to adaptation and biodiversity that they bring. It considers threats and appropriate management measures to ensure these benefits are maintained and maximised in the future.

AB  - Introduction: The ocean is a fundamental economic and environmental engine providing the services that are critical for the success of every economy and the very survival of life on our planet. And yet, it is seriously neglected with little formal value placed on the complex web of those life-giving ecosystem services. Should we choose to credit these services with their true value, we would find that the ocean is worth orders of magnitude more than the amount we are currently investing in it. Today, the majority of marine investments fail to effectively target a transition to a sustainable ocean economy, focusing instead on a predominantly extractive model which includes infrastructure projects, energy provision, commercial fishing and tourism. Despite the ocean’s scale and importance, climate finance is unfairly skewed away from nature-based solutions – and the little investment in nature that occurs is generally directed towards better understood or more visible terrestrial ecosystems. Of the very limited capital that is mobilised for sustainable ‘Blue Carbon’ projects, the evidence suggests that it is exclusively spent on protecting and restoring coastal saltmarshes, seagrasses and mangroves, with deep and open ocean ecosystems entirely overlooked.

AB  - Introduction: The ocean as a foundation of resilience: The ocean and all ecosystems composing it are the foundation for resilient life on earth. The ocean host vast reservoirs of biodiversity and provide crucial services to human well-being, such as global food security and the blue economy. Over a billion people worldwide depend on fish as a source of protein, over three billion people depend on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods, and all seven and half billion people on the planet depend on the ocean for half of the oxygen they breathe. The ocean serves large parts of the world’s economy, supporting sectors including tourism, international shipping, mineral resource extraction and renewable energy. Some national economies and prosperity mostly depend on ocean economy, especially in Small Island Developing States and low-lying delta countries. Economic activity in the ocean is expanding rapidly and is projected to double its contribution to global economy in 2030 on a “business-as-usual” scenario-basis, reaching conservatively over USD 3 trillion1 . Marine and coastal resources are particularly important for livelihoods of poor and vulnerable coastal communities. In addition to the role the ocean plays in economies, the cultural importance of the ocean is also recognised.

AB  - Introduction: Southeast Asia is considered as a ‘hotspot’ for multiple geophysical, weather and climate-related disasters where environmental risks are exposing the region’s poor socio-economic conditions, critical infrastructures and fragile natural resources, forging regional and national vulnerabilities [1–3]. A 2019 study by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) [4] revealed the quadrupled Average Annual Losses (AAL) due to these disasters in the region in past two years, indicating intensification of complex and imminent risks and a ‘new climate reality’. In this chapter, we analysed the potential impacts of climate change in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries to evaluate the implications on the region’s population, economy and environment. The analysis consists of reviewing and synthesizing relevant past and recent journal articles, technical reports, policy briefs, book chapters, and assessing contemporary initiatives on climate change adaptation (CCA). The chapter discussed the social and economic impacts of different disasters and climate change across the geographic region on several sectors such as water, environment, food security, livelihood, biodiversity and natural ecosystems, and development growth and plans. Collective efforts to address ASEAN’s response to these impacts with notable manoeuvres by different member states are sifted alongside relevant policy stocktaking on regional and national CCA and climate change mitigation (CCM) plans, programs and initiatives. The chapter provided further insights into the scenarios with relevant case studies from ASEAN and neighbouring countries to investigate potential opportunities for strategic plans and program development. Finally, the chapter draws a set of suggestions highlighting multi-sectoral approaches, regional strategies and programs on trans-boundary issues with proactive cooperation and innovative funding mechanisms towards developing adaptation actions for the ASEAN region. The chapter provides specific suggestions on locally-led adaptation actions (LLA) and nature based solutions (NbS) to meet the needs of those at the frontline to promote and ensure balanced socio-economic development and environmental sustainability in the ASEAN region.

AB  - Introduction: More than 200 countries have a coastline, and this forms the basis for their claims to territorial waters and exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Globally, about 40 percent of the world’s population live within the “near coastal zone”—the area below an elevation of 100 metres (m) and closer than 100 kilometres (km) from the coast (Kummu et al. 2016). The vast majority of resources for current and emerging sectors that comprise the “ocean— or blue—economy” are concentrated along coastal areas within these EEZs and must operate within a complex, multiple-use and often space-constrained context. The near coastal zone is also where the majority of many coastal nations’ commercial, residential, transport and national defence infrastructure is situated, and it is the backbone to domestic and international supply chains that deliver the marine goods and services upon which we increasingly rely

AB  - Introduction: Healthy marine and coastal ecosystems, and their services, are essential to maintain the earth’s life support system. Blue economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and ocean ecosystem health. It largely depend on marine and coastal ecosystems and the resources these ecosystems offer, but one that employs ecosystem-based and environmentally-sound technologies and practices. In order to sustainably use our coasts and oceans and to protect the health, livelihoods and welfare of people, it is increasingly recognized that at the same time we should also protect our coasts and oceans and reduce environmental risks and biodiversity losses. Furthermore, marine and coastal ecosystems are essential for future climate change mitigation and adaptation and measures should be implemented in such a way that these services are not jeopardized but strengthened. In this contribution the authors, researchers at Wageningen Marine Research (The Netherlands), highlight their vision and present their expertise within the field of Blue Economy, focusing on naturebased solutions (Building with Nature) and food security.

AB  - Introduction: Climate change presents one of the greatest challenges to society today. Effects on nature and people are first experienced in cities with extreme temperature gradients, and by now, about half of the human population globally lives in urban areas. Climate change has significant impact on ecosystem functioning and well-being of people. Climatic stress leads to a decrease in the distribution of typical native species and influences society through health-related effects and socio-economic impacts by increased numbers of heat waves, droughts and flooding events. In addition to climate change, urbanization and the accompanying increases in the number and size of cities are impacting ecosystems with a number of interlinked pressures. These pressures include loss and degradation of natural areas, soil sealing, pollutants diffusion and the densification of built-up areas, which pose additional significant challenges to ecosystem functionality, the provision of ecosystem services and human well-being in cities around the world.

AB  - Introduction: As the world witnesses and experiences the impacts of climate change, turning to nature could be a pragmatic way to adapt. Governments are being urged to implement ecosystembased approaches, including conservation, restoration, and improved land management, in both adaptation and mitigation (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2022; Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [IPBES], 2021). Such approaches, framed under the umbrella concept of nature-based solutions (NbS), are expected to be a key component of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and are already integrated into many countries’ National Adaptation Plans. However, controversy remains about what constitutes as NbS and how to achieve equitable outcomes while enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. Compounding this challenge is the unprecedented scale of biodiversity loss as a result of climate change and other interrelated drivers of change. This guidance note aims to clarify the concepts of NbS and Nature-Based Climate Solutions (NBCS) with an emphasis on climate adaptation. These adaptation-focused NbS are captured using the widely known term Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). Beyond awareness and knowledge of these terms, it is vital to unpack the social and biodiversity safeguards necessary for NbS to ensure that solutions are gender responsive and socially inclusive while delivering biodiversity benefits. This guidance note is a knowledge product of the Nature for Climate Adaptation Initiative (NCAI) (see Box 1).

AB  - Interest in the role that ecosystems play in reducing the impacts of coastal hazards has grown dramatically. Yet the magnitude and nature of their effects are highly context dependent, making it difficult to know under what conditions coastal habitats, such as saltmarshes, reefs, and forests, are likely to be effective for saving lives and protecting property. We operationalize the concept of natural and nature-based solutions for coastal protection by adopting an ecosystem services framework that propagates the outcome of a management action through ecosystems to societal benefits. We review the literature on the basis of the steps in this framework, considering not only the supply of coastal protection provided by ecosystems but also the demand for protective services from beneficiaries. We recommend further attention to (1) biophysical processes beyond wave attenuation, (2) the combined effects of multiple habitat types (e.g., reefs, vegetation), (3) marginal values and expected damage functions, and, in particular, (4) community dependence on ecosystems for coastal protection and co-benefits. We apply our approach to two case studies to illustrate how estimates of multiple benefits and losses can inform restoration and development decisions. Finally, we discuss frontiers for linking social, ecological, and physical science to advance natural and nature-based solutions to coastal protection.

AB  - Interest and investment in constructing living shorelines rather than harder engineering structures are on the rise worldwide. However, the performance of these interventions in rejuvenating coastal habitats, depositing fine sediments with elevated organic content, and reducing erosion varies widely and is often low along energetic shorelines. In this study, we test the efficacy of a living shoreline design that couples breakwalls and oyster restoration structures, in protecting coastal estuarine ecosystems and their services along energetic shorelines. A field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 along a section of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in northeast Florida, which experiences commercial and recreational vessel traffic. We discovered that organic matter, silt and clay content all increased in sediments collected in the living shorelines compared to paired control treatments. In addition, oysters established and developed into robust reefs on the gabions – wire cages filled with seasoned oyster shells - that were used to facilitate oyster recovery within this living shorelines design, although oyster growth was highest where the gabions were placed at lower intertidal elevations. Additionally, salt marsh cordgrass along shoreline margins protected by the living shoreline structures remained stable or began advancing toward the Intracoastal Waterway channel at rates of ~1 m per year, whereas cordgrass in control treatments retreated at rates approaching 2 m per year. This study provides powerful evidence that vessel wake stress is indeed driving ecosystem loss and that simple nature-based living shoreline structures designed to dissipate this energy can slow or reverse ecosystem decline. More research is needed to optimize these nature-based solutions for shoreline protection in coastal and estuarine settings, and to improve their durability.

AB  - Inter- and transdisciplinary place-based learning by international groups of students formed an integral component of the Partnerships for International Research and Education Coastal Flood Risk Reduction (PIRE-CFRR) program “Integrated, multiscale approaches for understanding how to reduce vulnerability to damaging events.” The program aimed to create “authentic learning environments” that supported and benefitted from ongoing research on flood risk management. Accordingly, an eight-step transdisciplinary, collaborative design workshop method was developed and applied to two problem situations: (i) the erosion hotspot of the southwest coast of Texel island and (ii) the future noncompliance of the old Hondsbossche Pettermer Sea Dike with Dutch flood defense standards. The effects of the workshop method were evaluated in terms of the process of co-design, the substantive outcomes, and the learning outcomes of individual students. Findings indicate that the co-design process created an open and authentic environment in which students from different disciplinary backgrounds could experience undertaking integrated, nature-based design. Wide-ranging nature-based solutions were produced with diverse biogeophysical and social features in all designs. This indicated that the students were equipped to work collaboratively to produce novel designs that incorporated multiple perspectives. Survey results affirmed the success of the transdisciplinary co-design workshop method as a means of teaching integrated, nature-based infrastructure design.

AB  - Integration of mangroves in projects to reduce coastal ﬂood risk is increasingly being recognised as a sustainable and cost-effective alternative. In addition to the construction of conventional hard ﬂood protection infrastructure, mangroves not only contribute to attenuating ﬂood events (functionality), they also recover in, and adapt to, a changing climate (persistence). The implementation of mangroves in ﬂood risk reduction, however, remains complex. This is because the innate functionality and persistence of mangroves depend on a range of environmental conditions. Importantly, mangroves may collapse when environmental impacts or climatic changes exceed key system thresholds, bringing uncertainty into a situation where failure could endanger lives and livelihoods. The uncertainties in mangrove functionality and persistence can be dealt with by (1) improving insights in how ecological and physical processes affect mangrove functionality and persistence across scales, (2) advancing tools to accurately assess and predict mangrove functionality and persistence, and (3) adopting an adaptive management approach combined with appropriate engineering interventions to enhance mangrove functionality and persistence. Here, we review existing evidence, monitoring techniques and modelling approaches from the viewpoint of mangrove functionality and persistence. Inspired by existing guidelines for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to reduce flood risk, we provide an operationalization for this new approach. In addition, we identify where further research efforts are required for the practical application of mangroves’ functionality and persistence in coastal flood risk management. Key aspects in the variability and uncertainty of the functionality and persistence of mangroves are their failure and recovery mechanisms, which are greatly site- and storm-speciﬁc. We propose ﬁve characteristic damage regimes that result in increasing reductions of mangrove functionality as well as post-storm recovery periods. Further research on the quantification of these regimes and their thresholds is required for the successful integration of mangroves in coastal flood risk management. Ultimately, the key challenge is the development of adaptive management strategies to optimise long-term mangrove functionality and persistence, or their resilience. Such adaptive strategies should be informed by continued mangrove functionality and persistence assessments, based on continued monitoring and modelling of key mangrove thresholds, and supported through well-established guidelines.

AB  - Insular environments have long been recognized as sensitive to issues linked to natural forces that occur every day (swells, currents, and winds) or that are exceptional (storms and cyclones). However, over the past few decades, additional pressure has arisen throughout many already-fragile islands: anthropization, the modification of natural areas by humans and for human usage. Since the 1970s, the number of tourists visiting Guadeloupe Island has strongly increased, driving coastline modifications (building of houses, hotels, diving clubs, etc.). Using panchromatic and high-resolution aerial imagery, the evolution of the coastline from 1950 to 2017 of 19 Guadeloupean beaches was assessed. This evolution was compared with a coastal vulnerability index to determine the sensitivity to morphological, hydrodynamic, and anthropic factors of each studied beach. The results showed that the Guadeloupe coast has become increasingly urbanized since the 1950s, with a transition from 4% of manmade structures along the shoreline in 1950 to 18% in 2017 across the study sites. Across all beaches, coastal erosion was noted and was caused by the simultaneous action of natural factors (hydrodynamics, storms, etc.) or anthropogenic factors (mass tourism, economic development, etc.). Overall, this study highlights the issue of coastal artificialization in Guadeloupe. To avoid irreversible detrimental effects of coastal degradation on the local population and the country's economy, new decisions favoring natural coastal environment buffers must be made rapidly.

AB  - Instead of using a classical engineering design approach, the inclusion and enhancement of public, recreational and ecosystem services were the focal point of the design. A unique and dynamic nature reserve with dunes, salt marsh and beach in front of the current dike was designed, with the goal of upgrading some 200 hectares of the Wadden Sea coastal area (UNESCO World Heritage Site). Central to the design are the interactions between ecology and sediment dynamics. In traditional hydraulic engineering, there is a trade-off between safety and ecological value, and between sediment stability and dynamics. Coarse sand resists erosion better, but provides a less suitable habitat for benthos, which makes the area less attractive to wading birds. Therefore, the target species and habitats were analysed, and sediment characteristics chosen accordingly. A specific strategy of including fine sands to stimulate benthos growth was applied. Other strategies for habitat creation included salt marsh recuperation and seashell patches. The design further dealt with the trade-off between recreational opportunities and the natural habitat disturbance, and between the dynamics of soft coastal protection and the lifetime of public functions. Project specific key performance indicators are assigned and monitored during construction and a five-year maintenance period. This paper presents a nature-based solution for enhancing a coastal defence system while maximizing the ecological value of the area. A soft design is laid out, where safety, nature, recreation, agriculture and public services come together.

AB  - Innovative solutions to improve the condition and resilience of ecosystems are needed to address societal challenges and pave the way towards a climate-resilient future. Nature-based solutions offer the potential to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems while providing multiple other benefits for health, the economy, society and the environment. However, the implementation of nature-based solutions stems from a discourse that is almost exclusively derived from a terrestrial and urban context and assumes that risk reduction is resolved locally. We argue that this position ignores the importance of complex ecological interactions across a range of temporal and spatial scales and misses the substantive contribution from marine ecosystems, which are notably absent from most climate mitigation and adaptation strategies that extend beyond coastal disaster management. Here, we consider the potential of sediment-dwelling fauna and flora to inform and support nature-based solutions, and how the ecology of benthic environments can enhance adaptation plans. We illustrate our thesis with examples of practice that are generating, or have the potential to deliver, transformative change and discuss where further innovation might be applied. Finally, we take a reflective look at the realized and potential capacity of benthic-based solutions to contribute to adaptation plans and offer our perspectives on the suitability and shortcomings of past achievements and the prospective rewards from sensible prioritization of future research. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB  - Infrastructure is necessary to protect and provide the goods and services required by humans. As coastal green infrastructure (CGI) aims to respect and work with natural processes, it is a feasible response to mitigate or avoid the consequences of coastal squeeze. The concept of CGI is receiving increased attention of late due to the challenges facing us, such as climate change, population growth and the overexploitation of natural resources on the coast. Terms which may be applied to encourage the construction of infrastructure, or to minimize the responsibility for poorly made decisions, often induce misunderstanding. In this paper, the concept of CGI and its use in solving coastal problems is reordered. Four categories are proposed, according to the degree of naturalness of the project: Nature reclamation, Engineered ecosystems, Ecologically enhanced engineering, and De-engineering/Relocation. Existing coastal risk evaluation frameworks can be used to design many types of CGI. Key concepts, challenges and good practices for the holistic management of coastal squeeze are presented from the analysis of successful and unsuccessful CGI projects worldwide.

AB  - Indus River Delta, Pakistan, is under continual threat of coastal erosion due to natural and anthropogenic activities. The variations in the shoreline position have significantly degraded agricultural lands, increased tidal floodplain areas, and subsequently affected the livelihood of the coastal communities under changing climatic scenarios. The present study was conducted to quantify the Indus delta shoreline variations using satellite data and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS 4.3) integrated with ArcGIS software. The statistical parameters End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear regression rate (LRR) were used for estimation of the shoreline change rate, while Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) was used to estimate the net change in the shoreline from 1972 to 2017. The analysis of results revealed that the erosion of the shoreline was dominant over the accretion, which ranged between 1 to 160 m/year with a net erosion rate of 18.87 ± 2.22 m/year. The net shoreline erosion rate was higher, i.e., 30.12 ± 3.13 m/year on the left bank side of the river Indus, compared to that of on the right bank side, i.e., 6.34 ± 2.85 m/year. The net landward shift in the shoreline of the delta from 1972 to 2017 was 860 ± 92 m. The DSAS software integrated with ArcGIS could successfully be used for shoreline change analysis for similar river deltaic areas of the World. The study recommends the employment of mitigation measures for the protection of the shoreline of the Indus delta.

AB  - Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world and has vast natural resources. In the maritime sector, efforts to realize the sustainability of natural resources in coastal ecosystems have focused on mangroves and seagrass meadows, also known as blue carbon ecosystems, that have an important role in regulating the Earth's climate. The need for ecosystem-based climate change mitigation combined with economic recovery and improved environment conditions has shifted the motivation and escalated mangrove restoration efforts in Indonesia. As the richest mangrove nation with the greatest mangrove carbon stocks in the world, recently Indonesia has taken significant steps in the land use sector to reduce emissions by acknowledging the ‘true’ value of mangrove carbon and setting priorities for mangrove conservation and restoration within Indonesia’s climate actions. This paper reviews opportunities and challenges in mainstreaming mangrove blue carbon into policy in Indonesia. We evaluate the gaps in regulations and policies and propose pathways for the national blue carbon action. As mangroves are embedded in both forestry and marine sectors and the responsibilities for management lies within several government ministries, an integrated framework is suggested to support the national blue carbon strategy. The Indonesia Blue Carbon Strategy Framework (IBCSF) encompasses three main elements that should be considered in order to address challenges and seize opportunities in blue carbon: coordination, policy and funding.

AB  - Increasing sea level rise and frequency and intensity of storms, paired with degrading ecosystems, are exposing coastal areas to higher risks of damage by storm events. Coastal natural habitats like dunes or saltmarshes, can reduce exposure of coastlines to these events and help to reduce the impacts and the potential damage to coastal property. The goal of our study was to evaluate the current vulnerability of the Portuguese northern coast to erosion and flooding caused by extreme events, and to assess the contribution of natural habitats in reducing both vulnerability and property damages considering sea level rise scenarios. The InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model was used to produce an Exposure Index for the Northern Portuguese coastline, for the current situation and for future IPCC scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, considering the presence and absence of coastal habitats. Results showed an increase in exposure with rising sea levels and expansion of high vulnerability areas. Coastal habitats contributed to a 28% reduction of high exposed segments for the current scenario, corresponding to a potential reduction of coastal property damage of 105 M€ during extreme events. For the sea level rise scenarios, coastal habitats could potentially reduce the amount of property damage by 190 M€ in 2050 and 285 M€ in 2100, considering RCP8.5 projections. This study highlighted the importance of natural habitats in protecting vulnerable coastlines and reducing the potential damages to properties from flooding. Such results can be incorporated in management plans and support decision making towards implementing an ecosystem-based approach to increase coastal communities resilience to cope with future environmental changes.

AB  - Increasing human population, urbanisation, and climate change have resulted in the proliferation of hard coastal infrastructure such as seawalls and breakwaters. There is increasing impetus to create multifunctional coastal defence structures with the primary function of protecting people and property in addition to providing habitat for marine organisms through eco-engineering - a nature-based solutions approach. In this study, the independent and synergistic effects of physical complexity and seeding with native oysters in promoting diversity and abundances of sessile organisms were assessed at two locations on Penang Island, Malaysia. Concrete tiles with varying physical and biological complexity (flat, 2.5 cm ridges and crevices, and 5 cm ridges and crevices that were seeded or unseeded with oysters) were deployed and monitored over 12 months. The survival of the seeded oysters was not correlated with physical complexity. The addition of physical and biological complexity interacted to promote distinct community assemblages, but did not consistently increase the richness, diversity, or abundances of sessile organisms through time. These results indicate that complexity, whether physical or biological, is only one of many influences on biodiversity on coastal infrastructure. Eco-engineering interventions that have been reported to be effective in other regions may not work as effectively in others due to the highly dynamic conditions in coastal environment. Thus, it is important that other factors such as the local species pools, environmental setting (e.g., wave action), biological factors (e.g., predators) and anthropogenic stressors (e.g., pollution) should also be considered when designing habitat enhancements. Such factors acting individually or synergistically could potentially affect the outcomes of any planned eco-engineering interventions.

AB  - Increasing anthropogenic pressure on the sea and alteration of coastscapes challenge the functioning of marine ecosystems and long-term reliance on blue economies, especially for developing southern economies. The structural hardening of shores can result in ecological disruptions, with cascading effects on the wellbeing and livelihoods of marginalised groups who depend on marine resources. Mitigation, adaptation and rehabilitation options for coastal developments should include innovative, socially responsible solutions to be used to modify shorelines and ensure long-term functionality of metropolitan coastal ecosystems. Nature-based innovations are being developed to improve surrogacy for natural marine ecosystems. The co-creation of nature-based structures, entailing partnerships between scientists and a local rural community is currently being considered in South Africa and we present this regional case study as a transdisciplinary framework for research in nature-based, ecological engineering of coastal systems. Novel transdisciplinary approaches include ecomusicological interventions, where traditional cultural expressions (TCEs) create opportunities for transgressive pedagogy. This step aims to ensure that the knowledge gathered through nature-based scientific research remains a part of community developed Indigenous knowledge systems. The merging of innovative, eco-creative approaches and TCEs has the potential to sustainably and ethically improve the functioning and diversity of coastal urban habitats. This review tackles the potential of transdisciplinary settings to transform urban coastlines using “low-tech” engineering and Indigenous eco-creative innovations to pedagogy, to benefit the people and biological communities as well as reduce social and gender inequalities.

AB  - Increased intensity of extreme climatic events and natural hazards, combined with sea level rise due to global warming, has increased the vulnerability of nearshore and coastal regions to extreme flooding and erosion. The existing hard-engineered infrastructures for flood protection are mainly built from concrete with very high carbon emissions throughout their life cycle. In recent years, the application of nature-based solutions to tackle adverse climatic events has received attention. Nearshore vegetations such as salt marshes and mangroves have proven to attenuate incoming wave energy, thereby reducing wave runup and overtopping at coastal defences. The effectiveness of seagrass vegetation on wave runup attenuation remains less studied. The aim of this physical modelling study was to investigate the performance of prototype seagrass vegetations on wave runup reductions, for a wide range of wave conditions. Results of this study showed that the seagrass vegetation was effective at reducing wave runup. It was found that the location of the vegetation patch within the surfzone and inner-surf zone can play a key role in wave energy dampening. The vegetation type, and packing density also play a significant role in determining the effectiveness of seagrass in wave energy mitigation.

AB  - Inclusion of ecosystem services (ES) information into national-scale development and climate adaptation planning has yet to become common practice, despite demand from decision makers. Identifying where ES originate and to whom the benefits flow–under current and future climate conditions–is especially critical in rapidly developing countries, where the risk of ES loss is high. Here, using Myanmar as a case study, we assess where and how ecosystems provide key benefits to the country’s people and infrastructure. We model the supply of and demand for sediment retention, dry-season baseflows, flood risk reduction and coastal storm protection from multiple beneficiaries. We find that locations currently providing the greatest amount of services are likely to remain important under the range of climate conditions considered, demonstrating their importance in planning for climate resilience. Overlap between priority areas for ES provision and biodiversity conservation is higher than expected by chance overall, but the areas important for multiple ES are underrepresented in currently designated protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas. Our results are contributing to development planning in Myanmar, and our approach could be extended to other contexts where there is demand for national-scale natural capital information to shape development plans and policies.

AB  - In this work we pilot a methodology to value the annual coastal protection benefits provided by mangroves in the Philippines and identify where these natural coastal defenses deliver the greatest protection. This is the first rigorous, engineering-based, nationwide evaluation of the effectiveness of mangrove habitats as natural defenses. By comparing flood damages for scenarios with and without mangroves, the study estimates the socioeconomic benefits for protecting people and property, to inform conservation and disaster risk reduction policies. Without mangroves, flooding and damages to people, property and infrastructure in the Philippines would increase annually around 25%. These habitats reduce flooding to 613,500 people/year, 23% of whom live below the poverty line. They also avert damages to 1 billion US$/year in residential and industrial property. If mangroves were restored to their 1950 distribution, there would be additional benefits to 267,000 people annually, including 61,500 people below poverty and an additional 453 mill. US$ in avoided damages. Currently, mangroves prevent more than 1.7 billion US$ in damages for extreme events (1-in-50-year). Ultimately, rigorous economic estimates of critical ecosystem services like this will help the national government to integrate the value of mangroves to people, into their national accounting systems.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce and test a framework to qualitatively assess the environmental impact of climate adaptation innovations with the ambition to facilitate the implementation of these adaptations. The framework was designed to enable continuous environmentally conscious benchmarking based on three environmental performance indicators: sustainable design, environmental impact and ecological impact. It was pilot tested by uninvolved experts and key-persons for two large-scale nature-based flood adaptation innovations in the Netherlands and discussed with environmental assessment professionals. Our findings indicate how the inclusion of our framework helps to identify important knowledge gaps regarding environmental co-benefits and trade-offs, and can be beneficial to both those developing the innovation and the local authorities charged with assessing the suitability of innovations. We conclude by noting how the incorporation of environmental impact assessment from the design stage of adaptations could supplement existing environmental assessment regulations pre-empting concerns rather than reacting to them.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the determinants of economic growth in countries with blue carbon, i.e. countries with open access to the sea and high mangrove mitigation potential, to explore the effects of potential anthropogenic pressures on these coastal ecosystems. For this purpose, we build a data set with 23 countries with blue carbon across different regions in the world for the period 1960-2009. We estimate the augmented Solow model including new growth theories, under a Bayesian moving average methodology that accounts for uncertainty. We find evidence that the neoclassical theory (the initial income and the investment in physical capital variables) as well as the demography, the macroeconomic policy and the natural capital theories are the robust determinants of economic growth in countries with blue carbon. In contrast, the investment in physical capital variable, and the macroeconomic policy and the natural capital theories are not relevant when using a worldwide sample of countries. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, natural capital exploitation, together with the high fertility rates in countries with blue carbon, highlight the potential anthropogenic pressures that coastal areas with blue carbon can be subject to such as land conversion for agriculture or aquaculture, farming run-offs, over-exploitation of blue carbon resources, urbanization, uncontrolled sewage and public works which, in turn, can degrade blue carbon ecosystems. Given these findings, we highlight the role of central governments to provide incentives for the protection of these nature-based solutions at the level of local policy makers and communities, and of international financial institutions to provide financial support for such initiatives in the developing countries that are represented in our data set. Secondly, our results on the role of natural capital on economic growth is largely consistent with the findings in the empirical literature on the economic growth determinants in developing countries. Indeed, compared to an average country the value of national natural capital per capita is reduced by more than half and there is evidence in the empirical literature that this is limiting factor for economic growth. In addition, there is also empirical evidence that a too strong economic dependence on national natural capital, almost two times higher than in an average country in our case, has a negative impact on economic growth.

AB  - In this paper, protection options for a high-value, industrial area along the coast of West Bengal (India) are investigated. The options are designed to protect against cyclone surges with a probability of 1/100 per year. Two alternatives are compared, a classical solution of a dike with a revetment and a solution with a mangrove belt in front of the dike. The results reveal that from a pure infrastructural cash-flow point-of-view, the mangrove solution is at least 25% cheaper than the classical solution with a rock revetment. An important finding is that this conclusion does not need the financial evaluation of the obvious additional ecological advantages that mangroves offer. It is postulated that these results are generally valid for high-value coastal areas under the attack of waves during storm surges.

AB  - In this paper we demonstrate a novel framework for assessing nature-based solutions (NBSs) in coastal zones using a new suite of numerical models that provide a virtual “replica” of the natural environment. We design experiments that use a Digital Twin strategy to establish the wave, sea level and current attenuation due to seagrass NBSs. This Digital Twin modelling framework allows us to answer “what if” scenario questions such as: (i) are indigenous seagrass meadows able to reduce the energy of storm surges, and if so how? (ii) what are the best seagrass types and their landscaping for optimal wave and current attenuation? An important result of the study is to show that the landscaping of seagrasses is an important design choice and that seagrass does not directly attenuate the sea level but the current amplitudes. This framework reveals the link between seagrass NBS and the components of the disruptive potential of storm surges (waves and sea level) and opens up new avenues for future studies.

AB  - In this chapter, we place ourselves in the year 2051 and reflect on how we used the lessons learned from past partnership efforts to successfully restore marine biodiversity throughout the preceding three decades. In 2020, 3.5 billion people depended on the ocean for their source of protein. By 2050, with an estimated population of 9.7 billion, the need for healthy marine ecosystems, with species and habitat biodiversity to support global food security, was paramount. This meant aggressively protecting and rebuilding the marine species populations and habitats necessary to restore marine ecosystem structure, function, and resilience, in tandem with mitigating the impacts of climate change and providing a sustainable means for coastal communities dependent on the ocean for their livelihoods. The partnering lessons learned over many decades and their associated impact on the national policies of many nations led to an increased number of collaborations across the globe, including initiatives from the United Nations in the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.

AB  - In the United States, extensive investments have been made to restore the ecological function and services of coastal marine habitats. Despite a growing body of science supporting coastal restoration, few studies have addressed the suite of societally enabling conditions that helped facilitate successful restoration and recovery efforts that occurred at meaningful ecological (i.e., ecosystem) scales, and where restoration efforts were sustained for longer (i.e., several years to decades) periods. Here, we examined three case studies involving large-scale and long-term restoration efforts including the seagrass restoration effort in Tampa Bay, Florida, the oyster restoration effort in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia, and the tidal marsh restoration effort in San Francisco Bay, California. The ecological systems and the specifics of the ecological restoration were not the focus of our study. Rather, we focused on the underlying social and political contexts of each case study and found common themes of the factors of restoration which appear to be important for maintaining support for large-scale restoration efforts. Four critical elements for sustaining public and/or political support for large-scale restoration include: (1) resources should be invested in building public support prior to significant investments into ecological restoration; (2) building political support provides a level of significance to the recovery planning efforts and creates motivation to set and achieve meaningful recovery goals; (3) recovery plans need to be science-based with clear, measurable goals that resonate with the public; and (4) the accountability of progress toward reaching goals needs to be communicated frequently and in a way that the general public comprehends. These conclusions may help other communities move away from repetitive, single, and seemingly unconnected restoration projects towards more large-scale, bigger impact, and coordinated restoration efforts.

We highlight some of these advances here, particularly for coastal (various hazards), riverine (floods), and mountain (landslides) environments. We also highlight that many international agreements reached in 2015 can facilitate the uptake of these approaches whereas ecosystem-based solutions can facilitate the achievement of many goals and targets related to DRR, CCA, and/or sustainable development enclosed in these agreements. Finally, the chapter provides an overview of the rest of the book.

AB  - In the last two decades, the concept of nature-based solutions (NbS) has emerged in the field of coastal flood risk management, where natural structures are used to attenuate the physical effects of waves. While the physical reach of this concept has been explored, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding its public perception and acceptance. Due to the importance of water in Dutch history and the change in water management in the 1980s, it is hypothesised that the Dutch perspective reflects this in the form of values and norms and thus a positive tendency for NbS can be observed. Thus, a case study approach was applied to the coastal regions of the province of Groningen, aiming at finding societal proof (values and norms) for the transition from ‘keeping the water out’ to ‘living with water’. Further organizations on the international, national, and regional levels were investigated based on their influence in shaping public opinion. Data collection consisted of a literature review, participation in a symposium and a questionnaire (n=67) completed in six municipalities in the province of Groningen. In line with the expectation, high biospheric values and awareness of climate stressors and low risk and cost evaluation appeared to be significantly related to NbS acceptance. A quantifiable determination of the level of acceptance on site can guide spatial planners in designing and modifying the design of NbS as a sole or additional method of flood protection. Based upon the socio-cultural background, acceptance can be raised through addressing perceived risks and costs, as well as broadening the educational capacity of coastal actors.

AB  - In the last few decades, hard coastal protection structures, such as seawalls and groynes, have become increasingly commonplace around the world. Conventionally, the effects of such structures have been considered within a modernist framework that evaluates the degree of human control over the land–sea interface. However, this dominant viewpoint overlooks the central role that sea defences play in the ongoing production of coastal communities, particularly in small island states. This paper responds to these issues by revealing how coastal protection structures, as contingently performed material configurations, are devised and come into being and the social relations that these structures create and influence. Drawing on empirical research undertaken on a small island in the Maldives over a period of 6 years, the paper demonstrates not only the challenges that coastal communities face in attempting to exert control over the unruly sea but also the thing-power of the protection measures themselves that are made and unmade as part of this process. These findings suggest the need for sensitivity towards the social roles and effects of hard coastal protection structures when devising approaches and policies that might see the decommissioning of such structures in favour of softer, ‘nature-based’ responses to the vitality of the non-human world. As structures with their own unique material complexities, hard defence measures are deeply involved in the production of multinatural island futures.

AB  - In the face of uncertainties around coastal management and climate change, coastal engineering interventions need to be able to adapt to changing conditions. Nature-based solutions and other non-traditional, integrated interventions are gaining traction. However, system-based views are not yet embedded into coastal management strategies. Moreover, the differences in coastal interventions, ranging from hard (‘grey’) to nature-based (‘green’) infrastructure remain understudied. In coastal management it is therefore challenging to work with the grey-green spectrum of interventions with clarity and focus, and to produce results that can be evaluated. The objective of this paper was to examine whether there is a common understanding of: the characteristics and differences between grey and green infrastructure, where interventions sit on this spectrum, and the resilience of grey versus green infrastructure. We conducted an integrative literature review of the grey-green spectrum of coastal infrastructure. We examined 105 coastal protection case studies and expanded the double-insurance framework to ensure an integrative approach, looking at both external and internal factors of resilience. Our review showed that external factors are typically used to characterise the grey-green spectrum. However, although useful, they do not facilitate a holistic comparison of alternative interventions. The additional consideration of internal factors (response diversity, multifunctionality, modularity and adaptive, participatory governance) bridges this gap. The review showed that dikes, reefs, saltmarshes, sand nourishment and dunes span a wider segment of the grey-green spectrum than they are generally categorised in. Furthermore, resilient solutions for adaptation are unlikely to be exclusively engineered or natural, but tend to be a mix of the two at different spatial scales (micro, meso, macro and mega). Our review therefore suggests that coastal planners benefit from a more diverse range of options when they consider the incorporation of grey and green interventions in the context of each spatial scale. We propose that internal resilience should be accounted for when infrastructure options are comparatively evaluated. This consideration brings attention to the ways in which the grey-hybrid-green spectrum of infrastructure enhances value for people.

AB  - In the context of climate change, coastal areas around the world face multiple interrelated challenges. A range of ‘international best practice’ approaches have been proposed to address these, including concepts such as integrated coastal zone management, ecosystem-based management and managed retreat. However, such supposedly mobile and transferable approaches often fail to properly account for the differences between local contexts, leading to implementation failures. In response, this paper mobilises the conceptual lenses of ‘situated practices’ and ‘path dependencies’ to demonstrate how the emergence and evolution of approaches to planning in coastal communities can generate policy trajectories that constrain the latitude for alternative options. The paper explores the trajectories of coastal planning on the island of Sylt in Germany and Castlemaine Harbour in Ireland. It identifies important path dependencies associated with institutional inertia, collective memories of past hazards and management strategies, the legacies of previous coastal management measures and of coastal development, and the importance of property relations. Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of appreciating the local and historical distinctiveness of coastal areas and communities. It shows that critical attention to context and creating inclusive fora for debate is required to advance climate change adaptation measures that offer opportunities to unlock historically anchored path dependencies which hamper flexibility and reduce resilience.

AB  - In the Belgian Part of the North Sea, the Coastbusters projects aim to develop nature-based coastal protection by favouring mussel bed establishment through dropper lines in situ installation. This was tested in a first finished project, and a mussel bed was formed during summer-autumn. In the second ongoing project, different hydrodynamic conditions were tested (sheltered area versus exposed area), as the successful development of this type of biogenic reef is dependent on the environmental conditions. Mussel beds are known to influence the structure and functioning of underlying macrofaunal communities. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to determine the effects of the newly created mussel bed and differences in hydrodynamic conditions on the biodiversity and functioning of macrobenthic communities. To detect these effects, a BACI (Before/After Control/Impact) approach was followed. Macrobenthic community structure was characterized by looking at density, biomass, and diversity. Functioning was assessed using secondary production estimates, biological trait analysis and functional diversity indices. Linear mixed models were used to determine statistical influences of the mussel bed and hydrodynamic conditions on those parameters. The mussel bed had no significant effect on the secondary production of associated macrofauna but minor shifts in lifespan, feeding behaviour and development mode were indicated by the biological trait analysis. The functional diversity indices suggested a better utilization of the different niches and higher productivity in the mussel bed compared to bare sediments but also lower traits differentiation, probably due to the higher abundance of oligochaetes in the mussel bed. As changes in associated communities are triggered by changes in mussel density, patch size and bed thickness (Koivisto et al., 2011), the results of this thesis cannot be extended to a year-round persistent mussel bed. Further studies are needed to understand the influence of newly created mussel beds on structural and functional characteristics of associated benthic communities. It is also important to encompass other components of biodiversity, such as epifauna and fish, to have a global overview on the impacts of the mussel bed on the surrounding biodiversity. The baseline characterization of the two Coastbusters 2.0 areas under different hydrodynamic conditions showed higher values of density, species richness and biomass in the sheltered area and high dissimilarity in community composition between the two areas. Important differences in feeding, mobility, development mode and bioturbation were found between the two hydrodynamic conditions in response to different flow and food flux conditions. The functional diversity indices revealed a better resource-use efficiency in the sheltered area, indicating a more valuable ecosystem functioning. Although no mussel bed developed in 2020, this baseline characterisation assessed the potential differences between sites. No differences between control and impacts sites could be found for any of the structural and functional characteristics investigated previously. These results are reassuring because the absence of initial differences between the two types of sites will make it possible to better determine the influence of the mussel bed on the benthos in comparison with a control site not influenced by the latter.

AB  - In response to the environmental damage caused by urbanisation, nature-based solutions (NbS) are being implemented to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem processes with mutual benefits for society and nature. Although the field of NbS is flourishing, experiments in different geographic locations and environmental contexts have produced variable results, with knowledge particularly lacking for the subtidal zone. This study tested the effects of topographic complexity on colonising communities in subtidal habitats in two urban locations: (1) Plymouth, UK (northeast Atlantic) and (2) Tel Aviv, Israel (eastern Mediterranean coast) for 15- and 12-months, respectively. At each location, topographic complexity was manipulated using experimental tiles that were either flat or had 2.5 cm- or 5.0 cm-crevices and ridges. In Plymouth, biological complexity was also manipulated through seeding tiles with habitat-forming mussels. The effects of the manipulations on taxon and functional richness, and community composition were assessed at both locations, and in Plymouth the survival and size of seeded mussels and abundance and size of recruited mussels were also assessed. Effects of topographic complexity differed between locations. Topographic complexity did not influence richness or community composition in Plymouth, while in Tel Aviv, there were effects of complexity on community composition. In Plymouth, effects of biological complexity were found with mussel seeding reducing taxon richness, enhancing larger recruited mussels, and influencing community composition. Our results suggest the that outcomes of NbS experiments are context-dependent and highlight the risk of extrapolating the findings outside of the context in which they were tested.

AB  - In response to shoreline erosion and potentially more severe storm damage due to climate change and sea level rise, armouring of shorelines using traditional hard structures is likely to increase. An emerging alternative to seawalls and other hard structures is to create ‘living shorelines’ where natural habitats are incorporated into a resilient shoreline stabilization design. Research has shown that functional, multiuse living shorelines provide options for reducing erosion rates and sustaining shoreline stability while supporting intertidal and nearshore habitat. Drawing upon the scientific literature, shoreline management best practices, and the results from an expert opinion survey, we propose a spatial decision framework for multiclass suitability analysis of generic shoreline stabilization options with a focus on the unique challenges and opportunities of South Florida. The results have been incorporated into a web application that can facilitate decision-making in support of nature-based stabilization infrastructure.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition that green, nature-based, infrastructure provided by coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs, can mitigate the impacts of climatic hazards in an efficient and cost effective manner. Coral reefs act as low-crested, submerged breakwaters reducing wave action and thus providing flood reduction benefits for coastal communities. This paper focuses on using coral reef restoration for coastal resilience purposes. In the absence of universally accepted guidelines for coral reef structures and a lack of direct measures of their effect in wave energy at relevant scales, the study focuses on a series of experiments in the University of Miami’s Surge-Structure-Atmosphere-Interaction (SUSTAIN) facility. Preliminary results revealed that wave heights, and thus wave energy, reduce after the coral reef with the decrease being wave-frequency dependent. Current studies focus on a series of tests including parameters related to the wave spectrum as well as the reef characteristics, such as reef length, width, slope and composition, through measurement of the wave height, water velocity and pressure on an auxiliary structure.

AB  - In recent years, nature-based solutions have gained recognition for their capacity to reduce flood hazard on coastal communities. These coastal threats range from waves and tides, to future storm variability and predicted sea level rise. Vegetated foreshores are one of the measures that fall under this palette of solutions, and are the focus of this thesis. While vegetated foreshores can be colonized by several plant species (mainly mangroves or marshes), this thesis presents the study of phenomena occurring at salt marshes in an attempt to determine which are relevant indicators that can predict the presence or absence of this ecosystem at a given location. Moreover, the wave height attenuation capacity of such vegetated foreshores under different conditions is also assessed for different effectiveness indicators, in a way that provides insight into whether this habitat is not just feasible, but also effective as a coastal protection measure, with respect to wave height attenuation. Results suggest that within a water system with similar sediment composition, inundation-free period and daily-occurring hydrodynamics can explain the presence/absence of vegetation at most sites, while storm conditions can the determining condition for vegetation absence in other locations. For comparison between systems, the dimensionless wave-induced excess bed-shear stress factor may serve as a relevnat proxy. These conclusions indicate the occurrence of sediment re-suspension during approximately 20% of the assessed time, at the most. From the wave attenuation effectiveness assessment, considerations for tidal regime, surge height, and type of wave forcing were used to determine the degree of effectiveness of salt marshes in the studied water systems, while defining effectiveness in terms relative to a mudflat located at MSL. Results suggest that salt marshes located in macro tidal sites, like in the Western Scheldt, can dissipate more wave energy than habitats located in micro or meso tidal areas, such as the Wadden Sea. On the other hand, results treating the different wave loads further indicates that greater attenuation may be achieved in sheltered coastal locations such as the Western Scheldt estuary, indicating that this system may be more effective in sheltered than in exposed coastal areas. Finally, the set of conclusions provided by both sections may serve to determine whether an arbitrary location is capable of hosting salt marsh vegetation, as well as the effectiveness of such nature-based solution with respect to wave height attenuation. The elaboration of an assessment tool was not achieved in this thesis; however, in order to perform a quick check for salt marsh introduction as an effective flood defense measure at a given site, results indicate the gathering of necessary data such as bed level elevations - for inundation-free period analysis - as well as occurring hydrodynamic forcing and sediment properties at such arbitrary site (excess bed shear stress determination, evaluated with the previously proposed limits). With respect to the degree of wave height reduction effectiveness, the determination of the occurring tidal regime, design surge heights, and considerations of sheltered/exposed coastal conditions may serve as a first estimate for this purpose.

AB  - In recent years, nature-based solutions are receiving increasing attention in the field of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation as inclusive, no regret approaches. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) can mitigate the impacts of climate change, build resilience and tackle environmental degradation thereby supporting the targets set by the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework. Despite these benefits, EbA is still rarely implemented in practice. To better understand the barriers to implementation, this research examines policy-makers' perceptions of EbA, using an extended version of Protection Motivation Theory as an analytical framework. Through semi-structured interviews with policy-makers at regional and provincial level in Central Vietnam, it was found that EbA is generally considered a promising response option, mainly due to its multiple ecosystem-service benefits. The demand for EbA measures was largely driven by the perceived consequences of natural hazards and climate change. Insufficient perceived response efficacy and time-lags in effectiveness for disaster risk reduction were identified as key impediments for implementation. Pilot projects and capacity building on EbA are important means to overcome these perceptual barriers. This paper contributes to bridging the knowledge-gap on political decision-making regarding EbA and can, thereby, promote its mainstreaming into policy plans.

AB  - In recent years the concept of “Blue carbon” has brought attention to the importance of Mangroves, Seagrass and Saltmarsh ecosystems in carbon cycles. Concerns over climate change has had countries commit to decreasing CO2 emissions, often using natural processes to sequester CO2. This trend has often followed a market approach through creating a monetary value and market for CO2. This Climate Finance strategy is now starting to be applied to Blue Carbon ecosystems however, seagrass is underutilised, and it is rarely used in developed nations. As such, this paper aims to test the applicability of such a governance model in this context, using Sweden and the management of seagrass ecosystems as a case study. This was assessed using a qualitative literature synthesis and frameworks developed from Wunder’s (2015) definition for Payment for ecosystem services (PES) and the concept for Loss and Damage applied to the Swedish context. This study found that market-based governance of the seagrass species Zoestera Marina, through the monetary value of its CO2 sequestration, fisheries enhancement, and coastal erosion protection services, has potential within a Swedish context. Specifically, the use of the Voluntary carbon market (VCM) is found to be the most applicable strategy. Furthermore, through applying seagrass ecosystems services to the Loss and Damage concept, it is shown that conserving and restoring such an ecosystem can reduce Loss and Damage from climate change. The use of the VCM approach as a basis for a demonstration project to improve management strategies and best practice is proposed. The use of the Loss and Damage concept as justification for this is suggested. The issues surrounding the concept of market based environmental governance are addressed and whether or not they apply in this case is discussed. Finally, further research regarding the application of this mode of governance on seagrass is discussed.

Specifically, the use of the Voluntary carbon market (VCM) is found to be the most applicable strategy. Furthermore, through applying seagrass ecosystems services to the Loss and Damage concept, it is shown that conserving and restoring such an ecosystem can reduce Loss and Damage from climate change. The use of the VCM approach as a basis for a demonstration project to improve management strategies and best practice is proposed. The use of the Loss and Damage concept as justification for this is suggested. The issues surrounding the concept of market based environmental governance are addressed and whether or not they apply in this case is discussed. Finally, further research regarding the application of this mode of governance on seagrass is discussed.

AB  - In recent times, environmental stewardship of mangroves has provided the impetus to protect and restore these ecosystems for their inherent ability to protect coastal regions from climate change, sequester carbon dioxide as rich blue carbon, and support human well-being through a multitude of ecosystem services. Participatory stakeholder assessment, as a part of the present study, integrated local stakeholder perspectives in assessing drivers of mangrove loss in Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi delta, Odisha, providing empirical evidence through a mixed-method approach. The use of a Likert scale provided the methodology to develop a single composite variable as the best measure of central tendency. In total, 27.5% of the respondents were locals and were living close to the study area for generations, whereas the other 72.5% represented researchers, academics, and forest department officials. Stakeholder responses at the ground level indicated that Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi delta were facing increased frequency of extreme climatic events followed, by aquaculture and other land-use changes, which can be considered potential drivers causing mangrove loss. Co-development of future scenarios by integrating concerns of all the stakeholders emerged as a potential solution to effectively address the trade-offs arising from local anthropogenic interferences, as well as large-scale developmental activities. This study highlights the need for convergence of multi-disciplinary knowledge from diverse stakeholder groups, including traditional and indigenous knowledge, for the purpose of developing accurate plausible alternative scenarios. Interactive governance and incentivization approaches, along with alternative livelihood opportunities, are proposed as the means to improve conservation and restoration in the region based on the present study. Understanding of the coupled socio-ecological system and its relevance is found to be critical to improve bi-directional linkages of ecosystem health and human well-being.

AB  - In order to understand why coastal erosion continues in Liberia and to offer useful guidelines that could be used by decision-makers to find long-term and affordable solutions to the threat of coastal erosion, this dissertation investigated the impacts of coastal erosion at coastal communities in Liberia. It also aimed to determine whether soft coastal protective measures could be used to protect the coastline from erosion while also protecting valuable marine species. Relevant literature and national reports were reviewed to ascertain secondary information about the status of Liberia’s coastal zone, and primary information was gathered by administering two sets of structured interview questionnaires to Liberian government officials from the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, and to coastal dwellers from the communities of West Point, New Kru Town, and Buchanan. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and the results were synthesized through Microsoft Excel 2016 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2016. The research results showed that the governance system in existence for Liberia's coastal zone is a technocratic top-down system in which all important management decisions are taken by coastal zone authorities with little to no involvement of the coastal dwellers. The findings showed that Liberia lacks a coastal zone policy and that the country's national environmental policy is the one being applied to the coastal zone. The research findings revealed that coastal erosion affects West Point more than New Kru Town and Buchanan because West Point is located below sea level and the residents of West Point build their homes very near to the ocean. The Government of Liberia (GoL) has built rock revetment walls in some of the affected communities to combat the erosion and plans to build more, despite the fact that the ones completed are not environmentally friendly. Soft measures have the potential to be used in some coastal areas in Liberia according to the research but coastal authorities are less interested in executing such long-term projects.

AB  - In order to improve coastal management and decision-making, it is necessary to quantify the coastal squeeze. This study proposes a methodology for quantitative coastal squeeze assessment in the Gulf of Mexico, based on a fuzzy logic approach. Three study sites in Campeche, Mexico, were selected, each with contrasting economic activities, populations and coastal infrastructure: Playa Bonita, Sabancuy and Nuevo Campechito. For the coastline evolution, the intensity and frequency of storms, land use change and coastal hardening were taken as the main drivers of coastal squeeze. For each study site maps of coastal squeeze distribution and intensity are presented. The results suggest that the entire coast of Campeche is undergoing a process of coastal squeeze that threatens the highly diverse coastal ecosystems there and endangers infrastructure and human lives.

AB  - In Norway, there has been a documented increase over the last 30 years in river discharge and transport of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from land to coastal waters. This has been attributed to climate change, in addition to other human impacts, and is expected to increase in the future. For Norwegian coastal waters, Aksnes et al. (2009) showed that there had been a long-term reduction in water clarity, termed “coastal darkening”, which was connected to a freshening of the Norwegian coastal current. The aim of this report is to provide an updated knowledge status by performing a literature review of recent publications (since 2009) on increased light attenuation and reported biological effects in Norwegian coastal waters (including Svalbard) and in global coastal systems comparable to Norway. In addition, we provide an overview of research projects (since 2005) related to changes in coastal light attenuation. Light attenuation is a measure of how quickly the light availability decreases from surface waters and down through the water column. There are several different optical variables that impact light attenuation in the water column by absorption (a) and scattering (b) of light, such as Chlorophyll a, colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM) and total suspended matter (TSM; inorganic and organic material). We found several studies that show a long-term decrease in Secchi depth and increased light attenuation in the North Sea and Norwegian coastal waters over the 20th century. Most of these studies link these changes to increases in riverine DOM (and in particular cDOM). Locally, an increase in TSM, either organic or inorganic, can also be a driver for increased light attenuation. Future predictions indicate an increase in precipitation which will most likely further increase the transport of DOM, cDOM and TSM to the coastal zones. Fjords, the Skagerrak/North Sea and Svalbard are areas that may be particularly likely to experience changes in light attenuation, either due to the physical characteristics of fjords with low sills restricting the water exchange, the Skagerrak due to high levels of cDOM, and Svalbard as the glaciers are bringing high loads of terrestrial material to the coastal zones. The depth of the euphotic zone is affected by changes in light attenuation, and increased light attenuation will affect all organisms that are dependent on light for photosynthesis, such as phytoplankton, benthic macroalgae and seagrasses and visual predators. For phytoplankton, delays in the onset of the spring bloom in the North Sea has been attributed to increased light attenuation. The largest number of articles were found in relation to mass occurrences of jellyfish in western fjords, where a long-term increase in light attenuation is believed to have increased the competitive advantage of jelly fish (tactile predators) over fish (visual predators). For several macroalgae species, a reduction in the lower growth depth has been observed in the Skagerrak, which has been partly attributed to increased light attenuation. Our global literature review showed that drivers and effects of reduced light availability have been reported across comparable global coastal systems to Norway (Baltic, North Sea, Canada, South America and New Zealand). Negative effects were mostly reported for light-dependent organisms, such as macroalgae and seagrasses and phytoplankton. Positive effects have been described for bacterial production, as well as filter feeders such as mussels. Mitigations have been reported to be most effective on catchment levels to reduce the increased input of terrestrial material and by advancing nature-based solutions to coastal protection. Our compilation of recently completed and ongoing relevant research project highlights a broad range of research related to changes in coastal light attenuation, as well as the broader impacts of riverine and glacial inputs on Norway’s coastal ecosystems, including Svalbard. While these studies will result in new relevant knowledge on this theme, this work also points to a need for more detailed process oriented research focusing on drivers, trends, and ecosystem impacts of coastal darkening, as well as predictions for how climate change is likely to impact light conditions in Norwegian coastal waters (including Svalbard) in the future. An inclusion of cDOM, DOC and TSM, as an additional parameter to Kd(PAR), Secchi depth, Chlorophyll a and turbidity within monitoring programs will make it possible to study and follow possible changes in the parameters contributing to the changes in the light attenuation. Sensors for spectrally-resolved light measurements and other related optical parameters should be used to provide a more detailed understanding of light attenuation and its drivers. In addition, use of remote sensing data and more autonomous monitoring systems allow for a larger spatial and temporal coverage. The reports summarize some key research needs, especially related to differentiating between key drivers of light conditions in coastal regions, the relevant processes involved in transforming organic material along the salinity gradient and potential mitigation measures for improving coastal light conditions.

AB  - In human-impacted coastal ecosystems, living shorelines are becoming a common restoration technique. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the ecological and physical benefits, and how they could inform management needs. To address this, we studied effectiveness of living shorelines at a broad spatial scale within the Washington State boundaries of the Salish Sea, USA, with restored site ages spanning 1–11 years. We surveyed 30 beaches at ten locations, each with three strata of: (1) living shoreline beaches with armor removed, (2) armored control beaches altered by seawalls or riprap, and (3) un-armored reference beaches with natural conditions. We sampled eight physical and biological attributes: beach wrack, wrack invertebrates, sediments, terrestrial insects, riparian vegetation, logs, beach profiles, and stable isotope signatures of talitrid amphipods – generating 27 metrics focusing on upper intertidal and supratidal elevations affected by armoring and targeted by living shoreline actions. These metrics spanned the functions of beach stability, ecological diversity, and food web support for juvenile salmon. Statistical tests showed that 19 of the 27 metrics had significant strata differences, indicating that some beach metrics restore quickly (e.g., wrack accumulation), while others take longer (e.g., log accumulation). Terrestrial-associated metrics were higher at reference beaches, but insect taxa richness and logs with plant growth increased at beaches restored for four or more years (the average age of the living shoreline sites). This implies that certain living shoreline functions increase through time, providing improved food web support. Globally, trajectories of restoration have shown a range of functional improvement with time, and will be important to monitor for nature-based solutions to coastal defense given the increasing rate of shoreline stressors from global change and sea level rise.

AB  - In Florida, human alteration of coastlines has led to large-scale degradation of coastal ecosystems, including oyster reefs, beach dunes, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes. Alteration of those habitats leads to the loss of associated ecosystem services, which are defined as "the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems" (MEA 2005) and include both products such as food and timber products and processes like coastal protection and disease control. Ecological restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed while repairing critical ecosystem structure and function in degraded systems and re-establishing the valuable services provided by these ecosystems (Montoya, Rogers, and Memmot 2012; Normile 2010). While ongoing restoration efforts aim to enhance degraded ecosystems, restoration has not always been a priority for coastal management. Indeed, Florida's history consists of widespread coastal development at the expense of the natural environment (Lewis et al 1999; Santschi et al. 2001).

AB  - In Fiji, as in other Pacific Islands, mangroves provide substantial resources to local indigenous peoples. These resources include fuelwood, timber, food, and natural medicines. Despite this, Fijian mangroves are still lost or degraded by tropical cyclones, rising tides, tourism development, agriculture, and major construction. To gauge the future health of Fijian mangroves, and their value to local populations, it will be necessary to perform both ecological and sociological surveys to initiate long term monitoring programs. This study comprised detailed botanical and soil analyses of the Nasilai River mangrove forests in the Rewa region of Viti Levu, the largest Fijian island. As part of this study we interviewed local villagers to obtain information about their use of mangroves, their knowledge of sustainable management, and the risks related to climate change. In terms of flora, 28 species of trees and ferns were recorded, with Rhizophora and Bruguiera gymnorhiza dominating, which is typical for mangroves in this area. Similarly, soil physico-chemical properties, such as salinity, pH, nitrogen, and phosphorous were all within expected ranges. Local villagers obtained multiple benefits from the mangroves, such as timber, firewood, medicines, dyes, fruits, and marine shellfish. It appeared that mangrove degradation near to the villages was primarily due to human activities such as over-harvesting, bark removal, and dumping of domestic waste, rather than from climate change effects. Additionally, tree species such as lemons, guava, and papaya, proliferated in sites near human habitation, thus reducing mangrove floral integrity of these areas. Most villagers were aware of sustainable practices relating to mangrove harvesting, and of threats due to climate change. However, only one of two villages surveyed had experienced formal training in climate change awareness. This study provides essential baseline ethnobiological data for comparison with future studies that will enable any changes in flora, soil

AB  - In an era of rapid coastal population expansion and habitat degradation, restoration is becoming an increasingly important strategy for combating coastal habitat loss and maintaining ecosystem services. In particular, techniques that use habitat restoration alone or restoration in combination with built infrastructure to provide coastal protective services are growing in popularity. These novel approaches, often called living shorelines, have the potential to expand the reach and applicability of coastal restoration projects. To understand how living shorelines research has expanded over time, we conducted a scoping review of English-language peer-reviewed articles. We included papers that self-identified as living shorelines research, as well as studies that used other related terminology, to investigate trends in publication rates, geography, site characteristics, and outcomes measured. Using a systematic search protocol, we compiled a database of 46 papers; the earliest study was published in 1981, and the earliest study to use the term living shoreline was published in 2008. Eighty-three percent of studies were conducted in North America, followed by 11% in Asia, and 7% in Europe, but the use of the term living shoreline was almost exclusively restricted to North America. Saltmarshes, oyster reefs, mangroves, and freshwater vegetation were used in living shoreline designs, but 91% of studies also incorporated structural materials like oyster shell and rock. Most living shorelines research was conducted at sites that were less than five years old. The vast majority of studies exclusively reported on ecological outcomes (89%), and of those, ecological processes were measured in 74% of studies. Processes related to coastal protection were measured most frequently (52% of ecological studies), followed by biological interactions, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. All together, our data suggest that living shorelines research is on the rise, but there is a need for more long-term data, socio-economic research, further consensus on the terminology used to describe different types of projects, and research on the types of living shorelines that are most effective in different environmental contexts. Future long-term and interdisciplinary research will help to elucidate the full effects of living shorelines.

AB  - In a context of growing concern about climate change and its potential consequences for coastal systems, adaptation is becoming more important than ever before. This paper presents a national planning framework for adaptation to climate change, which is pioneer in the field as it is multi-sectoral and focuses specifically on coastal areas, pursuing the safety of their communities in an uncertain future. The strategy is statutory as it emanates from the new Spanish Coastal Law, which in addition to many other implications includes the compulsory development of a Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change (SSCACC) and its submission to Strategic Environmental Assessment. This paper covers the fundamental aspects of both the SSCACC and the accompanying Strategic Environmental Study, providing recommendations on the assessment of coastal risks triggered by climate change and extreme events, adaptation and risk reduction planning and implementation, and monitoring. Additionally, this work gives insight into the wide-ranging consultation process carried out prior to the SSCACC's approval and the stakeholders involved, and how the SSCACC handles climate change uncertainty and struggles for overcoming barriers.

AB  - In 2016, a series of workshops were held to discuss living shorelines in Southern California. The workshops specifically focused on the unique benefits, challenges and opportunities for implementing living shorelines in the region, and the nexus between nature-based solutions and ongoing local adaptation planning. Approximately 140 participants partook in these dialogues, and some of the key themes that emerged include:  Letting nature do the work for you  Designing for the future  Integrating nature into shoreline management projects  Project goals distinguishing living shorelines  Engineering and urban living shorelines  Space constraints along urban coastlines  Permitting pathways to support demonstration projects  Living shorelines and phased sea level rise planning  Designing with watersheds and sediment management in mind  Exploring emerging commercial opportunities  Public access and project success  Planning for living shorelines alongside the community  Sharing monitoring and best practices to ensure future success  Citizen science and socio-ecological monitoring The workshops provided the first ever opportunity for Southern California stakeholders to outline what is unique about designing living shorelines in the context of Southern California shorelines for state and federal entities.

AB  - In 2011, coastal shoreline counties contributed $6.6 trillion to the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—just under half of GDP that year. Critical to the effective uptake of living shorelines is the recognition that a particular habitat or biophysical feature does not exist in isolation. Living shorelines play an important role in acting as a management tool that meets certain societal needs such as shoreline erosion reduction, storm surge buffering, and nutrient removal. Additional information, including on performance and market/nonmarket values, is needed in order to incorporate natural and hybrid infrastructure solutions into policy, investment trade-offs, and decision-making. In a helpful analysis, the White House Ecosystem Services Assessment details the most pressing remaining challenges to economic assessment of ecosystem services provided by natural infrastructure. Better data and information, on how the structure and dynamics of different coastal ecosystems connected to living shoreline approaches result in outputs that are directly relevant and useful to decision-makers, is necessary.

AB  - IISD defines natural infrastructure (NI) as ecosystems that provide infrastructure through services that are inherent to such ecosystems, while also perpetuating active conservation efforts and the enhancement of the environments they are embedded in. We find that “natural infrastructure,” “nature-based infrastructure” and “green infrastructure” are interchangeable terms in literature. For the purposes of this report, and the development of a specific module of the Sustainable Asset Valuation (SAVi) tool, IISD chose to use the term “natural infrastructure.” There are two main types of NI that are covered in this report and included in SAVi: (1) “natural,” as defined above (e.g., wetlands); (2) “green-grey,” urbanized NI; it tends to hybridize NI and grey infrastructure into easily implementable structures to urban environments (e.g., permeable pavements, green spaces).

AB  - IIn the present context of sea-level rise, the reconstruction of previously reclaimed intertidal areas represents an opportunity to build dynamic coastal defences, to decrease flooding under storm conditions by the dissipation of wave and surge energy across the vegetated domain. In Europe, this approach started in the late 1990s along the coast of eastern and southern England but it is becoming common to many European countries around the North Sea margin. The process of salt-marsh restoration normally develops around the opening or removal of flood protection structures and gradual flooding of the hinterland. If the intertidal zone starts to experience vertical accretion, vegetation will colonize the area and a saltmarsh will develop. This paper presents the morphological evolution and sediment distribution in the Perkpolder basin, SW Netherlands (NL), following the conversion of a reclaimed area into a tidal flat, after the opening of an inlet in the flood defence structures in June 2015. The main focus of this study is the description of the evolution of the tidal flat since the opening of the inlet and the identification of spatio-temporal conditions for the evolution of a salt marsh. To reach this objective, several topographic surveys were undertaken, together with sediment surface sampling. Sedimentation rates at fixed sampling stations were assessed during the transition between neap and spring tides over a period of 1 month and 2 weeks. The morphological analysis of the inlet evolution proved that 6 - 8 months after the opening the inlet reached an equilibrium state. The average accretion rate across the whole study area was about 6 - 7 cm year-¹. The average deposited sediment was about 100 g m-² per day. Considering the sedimentation rates in the most elevated regions, 80-110 cm above NAP (Normaal Amsterdams Peil), and assuming that the sedimentation rate will remain constant in time, the conditions for the on-set of salt-marsh formation will not be reached before 8-10 years. Projections indicate that the area located at +50 cm above NAP will not become a mature marsh before 50 years.

AB  - Hydrodynamic forces from ships operating in sheltered, confined fairways can result in increased wave impact and sediment transport leading to loss of land and habitats. Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer the potential to mitigate ship-induced erosion and increase biodiversity and ecosystem services. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of NBS in a sheltered, confined fairway located in a cold, temperate region. The case study presents the results of a 2.5-year study of the morphologic response at two sites where NBS was implemented to mitigate bluff erosion and at one site where NBS was implemented to mitigate the retreat of a reed belt. Moreover, a qualitative assessment was made of the vegetation development at the sites. The results showed that fine sediments with planted vegetation could not withstand the hydrodynamic forces induced by the ships. However, by adding sills as stabilizing structures, the forces were sufficiently attenuated for the vegetation to establish. The vegetation, which reduced the ship-generated waves and currents, was especially important during high water-level events when the energy dissipation by the sill decreased. Moreover, a small-scale nourishment was successfully applied to mitigate bluff erosion without negatively affecting sediment supply to an adjacent sandy beach. This study demonstrates that NBS can be implemented to retain erodible sediment and favour vegetation growth in fairways experiencing primary and secondary waves produced by large, ocean-going ships.

AB  - Hydrodynamic differences among shorelines with no vegetation, reference vegetation (mature mangrove), and vegetation planted on restored shoreline (marsh grass and young mangrove) were compared based on field observations 6.5 years after living shoreline restoration. Mean current velocities and waves were more strongly attenuated in vegetation (from channel to shoreline: 80–98% velocity decrease and 35–36% wave height reduction) than in bare shoreline (36–72% velocity decrease, 7% wave height reduction, ANOVA: p < 0.001). Normalized turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates were significantly higher in reference vegetation (0.16 ± 0.03 m−1) than in restored (0.08 ± 0.02 m−1) or bare shoreline (0.02 ± 0.01 m−1, p < 0.001). Significant differences in the current attenuation and turbulence dissipation rates for the reference and planted vegetation are attributed to the observed differences in vegetation array and morphology. Although the hydrodynamic analyses did not suggest limitations to recruitment, mangrove seedlings were not observed in restored vegetation, while four recruited seedlings/m were counted in the reference vegetation. The lack of recruitment in the restored shoreline may suggest a lag in morphological habitat suitability (slope, sediment texture, organic matter content) after restoration. Although hydrodynamics suggest that the restored site should be functionally similar to a reference condition, thresholds in habitat suitability may emerge over longer timescales.

AB  - Hydro-meteorological risks due to natural hazards such as severe floods, storm surges, landslides and droughts are causing impacts on different sectors of society. Such risks are expected to become worse given projected changes in climate, degradation of ecosystems, population growth and urbanisation. In this respect, nature-based solutions (NBSs) have emerged as effective means to respond to such challenges. A NBS is a term used for innovative solutions that are based on natural processes and ecosystems to solve different types of societal and environmental challenges. The present paper provides a critical review of the literature concerning NBSs for hydro-meteorological risk reduction and identifies current knowledge gaps and future research prospects. There has been a considerable growth of scientific publications on this topic, with a more significant rise taking place from 2007 onwards. Hence, the review process presented in this paper starts by sourcing 1608 articles from Scopus and 1431 articles from the Web of Science. The full analysis was performed on 146 articles. The analysis confirmed that numerous advancements in the area of NBSs have been achieved to date. These solutions have already proven to be valuable in providing sustainable, cost-effective, multi-purpose and flexible means for hydro-meteorological risk reduction. However, there are still many areas where further research and demonstration are needed in order to promote their upscaling and replication and to make them become mainstream solutions.

AB  - Hydro-meteorological hazards (HMHs) have had a strong impact on human societies and ecosystems. Their impact is projected to be exacerbated by future climate scenarios. HMHs cataloguing is an effective tool to evaluate their associated risks and plan appropriate remediation strategies. However, factors linked to HMHs origin and triggers remain uncertain, which pose a challenge for their cataloguing. Focusing on key HMHs (floods, storm surges, landslides, droughts, and heatwaves), the goal of this review paper is to analyse and present a classification scheme, key features, and elements for designing nature-based solutions (NBS) and mitigating the adverse impacts of HMHs in Europe. For this purpose, we systematically examined the literature on NBS classification and assessed the gaps that hinder the widespread uptake of NBS. Furthermore, we critically evaluated the existing literature to give a better understanding of the HMHs drivers and their interrelationship (causing multi-hazards). Further conceptualisation of classification scheme and categories of NBS shows that relatively few studies have been carried out on utilising the broader concepts of NBS in tackling HMHs and that the classification and effectiveness of each NBS are dependent on the location, architecture, typology, green species and environmental conditions, as well as interrelated non-linear systems. NBS are often more cost-effective than hard engineering approaches used within the existing systems, especially when taking into consideration their potential co-benefits. We also evaluated the sources of available data for HMHs and NBS, highlighted gaps in data, and presented strategies to overcome the current shortcomings for the development of the NBS for HMHs. We highlighted specific gaps and barriers that need to be filled since the uptake and upscaling studies of NBS in HMHs reduction is rare. The fundamental concepts and the key technical features of past studies reviewed here could help practitioners to design and implement NBS in a real-world situation.

AB  - Hybrid living shorelines use a combination of engineered structures with natural ecosystems to achieve coastal protection and habitat restoration outcomes, with added co-benefits such as carbon sequestration. Rock fillets constructed along eroding estuarine banks are designed to accumulate sediment, establish mangroves, and stabilise the shoreline. There is, however, a lack of data to support whether rock fillets are achieving these goals. We used a chronosequence of rock fillets to determine their effect on mangrove development, bank stabilisation and carbon sequestration in four estuaries in New South Wales, Australia. Aboveground biomass and adult density increased with age of rock fillets, and mangrove structure was similar to a natural fringing mangrove after 15 years. The rock fillets accumulated sediment, which reduced the eroded estuary bank height, however, little effect of the fillets on bank slope was observed. Sediment carbon stocks were not different between rock fillets, eroding estuary banks and natural fringing mangroves. Rock fillet design had a significant effect on mangrove structure and coastal protection function, with greater wave transmission through lower rock fillets, suggesting design optimisation is needed. As the construction cost of the rock fillets was equal or less than traditional rock revetments, where suitable they present a more economic and environmentally sustainable solution to estuarine erosion management.

AB  - Hurricane Maria, a category 4 tropical cyclone, hit the US non-incorporated territory of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Widespread physical and natural infrastructure damage was observed, especially in already vulnerable coastal communities. As public sector funding availability for natural infrastructure (ex. coastal ecosystems) increases, mechanisms for its efficient and equitable allocation are lacking. An accessible and replicable coastal vulnerability indicator framework is presented to assist state and federal policy makers in the allocation of funding for coastal natural infrastructure recovery. To assess funding priorization gaps and test the applicability of the proposed framework, spatial patterns in the estimated funding need identified in state-led post-Hurricane Maria assessments for natural infrastructure rehabilitation efforts were compared to physical and social coastal vulnerability estimations. Three main challenges that emerge during the implementation of a vulnerability indicator framework were considered for its design: (1) the compressed time frame in which decisions are made after an extreme weather event, (2) the availability of data to calculate indicators in a reduced time frame, and (3) the accessibility of results to a broad variety of stakeholders. We propose a vulnerability indicator framework that can become operational in a relatively short period of time, attempts to simplify data gathering efforts, and uses methods that aim to be more transparent and understandable to a broad group of stakeholders.

AB  - Humans have engineered the coasts for centuries, trying to create stability for the built environment in a system that is inherently dynamic. Continued coastal development and sea level rise are increasing the demand for engineered coastlines. Simultaneously, restoration dollars made available by the Deepwater Horizon settlements in the Gulf of Mexico will likely fuel a boom of such projects—from oyster reefs to armoring. These projects are often designed to achieve one particular goal such as coastal protection, oyster restoration, or erosion control, yet often have unintended impacts that jeopardize declining populations of coastal wildlife. With advanced planning and consideration, coastal engineering projects can be designed to minimize impacts and in some cases provide benefits to these species. This report summarizes the impacts of coastal engineering on the American Oystercatcher and provides recommendations for permit applicants, project engineers, and regulatory reviewers to improve future projects for the benefit of these imperiled shorebirds.

AB  - Humans have been constructing coastal defences for 7,000 years1. However, with climate change and continued coastal population growth, traditional defences can no longer keep pace. This is accelerating the need for a broader range of coastal protection interventions. Regardless of whether the Paris Agreement is achieved, most locations globally will experience sea level rise and an amplification in the magnitude and/or frequency of extreme storm events2. Traditional coastal protection methods used to protect communities and coastal assets from erosion and flooding are hard structures, such as seawalls, breakwaters, groynes and dikes. A significant annual investment and maintenance cost of US$12–71 billion for protecting the globe with dikes alone is required if we continue to defend the coast in this way3. Part of this maintenance cost is because hard structures are non-adaptive — they have to be upgraded, repaired and rebuilt in response to a changing climate. Hard structures are expensive to build and have environmental and social costs as coastal habitats (for example, dunes and beaches, mangroves and saltmarshes) are replaced with artificial ones, severing the transition zone between terrestrial and marine systems4 and human access to natural shorelines. A continued reliance on traditional defences in a future of growing societal demand for shoreline protection is economically, environmentally and socially unsustainable.

AB  - Human population growth and accelerating coastal development have been the drivers for unprecedented construction of artificial structures along shorelines globally. Construction has been recently amplified by societal responses to reduce flood and erosion risks from rising sea levels and more extreme storms resulting from climate change. Such structures, leading to highly modified shorelines, deliver societal benefits, but they also create significant socioeconomic and environmental challenges. The planning, design and deployment of these coastal structures should aim to provide multiple goals through the application of ecoengineering to shoreline development. Such developments should be designed and built with the overarching objective of reducing negative impacts on nature, using hard, soft and hybrid ecological engineering approaches. The design of ecologically sensitive shorelines should be context-dependent and combine engineering, environmental and socioeconomic considerations. The costs and benefits of ecoengineered shoreline design options should be considered across all three of these disciplinary domains when setting objectives, informing plans for their subsequent maintenance and management and ultimately monitoring and evaluating their success. To date, successful ecoengineered shoreline projects have engaged with multiple stakeholders (e.g. architects, engineers, ecologists, coastal/port managers and the general public) during their conception and construction, but few have evaluated engineering, ecological and socioeconomic outcomes in a comprehensive manner. Increasing global awareness of climate change impacts (increased frequency or magnitude of extreme weather events and sea level rise), coupled with future predictions for coastal development (due to population growth leading to urban development and renewal, land reclamation and establishment of renewable energy infrastructure in the sea) will increase the demand for adaptive techniques to protect coastlines. In this review, we present an overview of current ecoengineered shoreline design options, the drivers and constraints that influence implementation and factors to consider when evaluating the success of such ecologically engineered shorelines.

AB  - Human impacts on deltas often involve reclamation of coastal wetlands, causing a dramatic loss of ecological functions. We propose an Ecosystem Services (ES) approach to promote coordinated governance of aquaculture and environmental conservation in a brackish lagoon of the Po River delta (Italy). Spatiotemporal changes of aquatic vegetated habitats and clam production were evaluated, and experimentally related to ESs: climate regulation, habitat provision for birdlife, and potential for birdwatching. Almost all emergent vegetation was lost during past decades, while aquaculture production increased rapidly. Vegetated habitats sequestered significant amounts of carbon and supported more diverse bird communities than non-vegetated wetlands, including protected species of interest for birdwatching. We demonstrated that sectoral management was ineffective in maintaining ESs, promoting the exploitation of few provisioning services while decreasing many others. We propose an innovative, integrated management that focuses on restoring aquatic vegetation to offset anthropic impacts for the future sustainable governance of deltas.

AB  - Human encroachment on the coasts is extensive and expected to increase over the coming decades globally. Due to the close proximity to the sea, human settlements are threatened by strong cyclones, precipitation events, and sea level rise which lead to erosion, flooding, and landslides. These natural hazards are major problems of the modern era that affect human life and property, and are expected to exacerbate in the coming years. As an alternative to the traditional engineering solutions, nature-based solutions (NBS) can be a viable solution to maintain the resilience of coastal zones, although their benefits have not been clearly demonstrated. Green infrastructure (GI) concept is identical to NBS, and it refers to the man-made infrastructure within natural spaces that can improve ecology and be resilient while bring economic, environmental and social benefits to the communities. Based on a systematic critical literature review of NBS, a generic, multidisciplinary framework was developed to identify the resilience indicator sets of NBS against shallow landslides, erosion, and flooding. In this paper, three resilience indicator sets were identified which are critical for protection of coastal communities against natural hazards. These indicator sets were linked with Industry 4.0 concepts to enhance the sustainable applicability of the framework. The proposed framework stages can be used to establish functional coordination among different stakeholders e.g. engineer, asset owner, land manager, eco-engineers and community. This would also provide a systematic mechanism to assess the effects of natural hazards, propose solutions, and implement strategies for NBS to mitigate the effects of climate risks. Additionally, to achieve long-term resilience, multidisciplinary knowledge of the risks and processes occurring at different stages of framework is necessary. To achieve this, in future, key performance indicators will be developed within each resilience indicator set in context of natural hazards.

AB  - House Bill 2187i, introduced by Delegate Keith Hodges in the 2021 session of the Virginia General Assembly, directed the Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency (CCRFR), a partnership between Old Dominion University, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) and the William & Mary Law School’s Virginia Coastal Policy Center (VCPC) established by Virginia Chapter 440 of the 2016 Acts of Assembly (HB 903), to evaluate the development of a Flood Resiliency Clearinghouse Program (henceforth Clearinghouse). The bill stipulated that the Center should work with the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) to evaluate solutions that manage both water quality and flooding and emphasize naturebased solutions. Further, it states that the CCRFR and DCR shall evaluate solutions that include both “approved and not-yet-approved stormwater best management practices”. The intent of HB 2187 to provide an easily accessible resource to aid policymakers, state agencies, localities, businesses, and the public in implementing flood protection practices that are protective of water quality is clear. Less clear is the geographic and the programmatic/jurisdictional scope of the best management practices (BMPs) to be considered and the specific roles that the Clearinghouse would play beyond being a repository for information on existing BMPs ranging from shoreline erosion control to stormwater management. This report takes the approach of assuming that the intent of the bill is for the Clearinghouse to be a statewide resource, but much of the analysis is focused on the coastal zone where jurisdictional and regulatory structures include additional levels of complexity. While there are currently best management practices (BMPs) approved in the Commonwealth for the management of stormwater quantity and quality, these practices were not designed to withstand flooding impacts and have not been evaluated for flood control in the riparian and littoral zones. There is a need in Virginia for innovative shoreline strategies that manage water quality and flooding and protect the coastline from erosion related to rising sea levels and storm surge. A Flood Resiliency Clearinghouse could be a resource to promote resilient shoreline solutions and could provide the cross-agency collaboration needed to evaluate and approve solutions that manage both water quality and flooding. The Clearinghouse could fill the need in the Commonwealth for a one-stop location to identify BMPs for a particular activity intended to provide flood protection while being protective of water quality.

AB  - High-resolution benthic habitat data fill an important knowledge gap for many areas of the world and are essential for strategic marine conservation planning and implementing effective resource management. Many countries lack the resources and capacity to create these products, which has hindered the development of accurate ecological baselines for assessing protection needs for coastal and marine habitats and monitoring change to guide adaptive management actions. The PlanetScope (PS) Dove Classic SmallSat constellation delivers high-resolution imagery (4 m) and near-daily global coverage that facilitates the compilation of a cloud-free and optimal water column image composite of the Caribbean’s nearshore environment. These data were used to develop a first-of-its-kind regional thirteen-class benthic habitat map to 30 m water depth using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach. A total of 203,676 km2 of shallow benthic habitat across the Insular Caribbean was mapped, representing 5% coral reef, 43% seagrass, 15% hardbottom, and 37% other habitats. Results from a combined major class accuracy assessment yielded an overall accuracy of 80% with a standard error of less than 1% yielding a confidence interval of 78–82%. Of the total area mapped, 15% of these habitats (31,311.7 km2) are within a marine protected or managed area. This information provides a baseline of ecological data for developing and executing more strategic conservation actions, including implementing more effective marine spatial plans, prioritizing and improving marine protected area design, monitoring condition and change for post-storm damage assessments, and providing more accurate habitat data for ecosystem service models.

AB  - Helping the world’s coastal communities adapt to climate change impacts requires evaluating the vulnerability of coastal communities and assessing adaptation options. This includes understanding the potential for ‘natural’ infrastructure (ecosystems and the biodiversity that underpins them) to reduce communities’ vulnerability, alongside more traditional ‘hard’ infrastructure approaches. Here we present a spatially explicit global evaluation of the vulnerability of coastal-dwelling human populations to key climate change exposures and explore the potential for coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change (ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)). We find that mangroves and coral reefs are particularly well situated to help people cope with current weather extremes, a function that will only increase in importance as people adapt to climate change now and in coming decades. We find that around 30.9 million people living within 2km of the coast are highly vulnerable to tropical storms and sea-level rise (SLR). Mangroves and coral reefs overlap these threats to at least 5.3 and 3.4 million people, respectively, with substantial potential to dissipate storm surges and improve resilience against SLR effects. Significant co-benefits from mangroves also accrue, with 896 million metric tons of carbon stored in their soils and above- and below-ground biomass. Our framework offers a tool for prioritizing ‘hotspots’ of coastal EbA potential for further, national and local analyses to quantify risk reduction and, thereby, guide investment in coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change. In doing so, it underscores the global role that conserving and restoring ecosystems can play in protecting human lives and livelihoods, as well as biodiversity, in the face of climate change.

AB  - Heavy precipitation events are expected to increase in the future, due to climate change. This predicted change will increase the risk of flooding, especially in urban areas. To mitigate these challenges and support a sustainable urban development, Nature-based solutions (NBS) can be used as a flood risk reduction measure. The NBS wetlands and constructed wetlands, composed of ponds, canals and ditches, are commonly used solutions which are multifunctional and primarily provides flood regulatory services, water quality improvements and increased biodiversity. To reach the full potential of NBS, the location and design is crucial. At present planning practise, a user friendly and time efficient tool to investigate suitable locations within a catchment is missing, where the concept of connectivity has arisen as a useful approach. In this study, the NBS concept and the potential of wetlands for flood risk mitigation have been investigated. In addition, the connectivity of two study case catchments has been analysed by using the Connectivity Index (IC index) by Cavalli et al. (2013). The aim has been to evaluate whether the IC index can be used to find suitable locations for NBS. Further, the study seeks to investigate how the IC index can be integrated into NBS planning practice in order to create useful information for the decisionmaking process. To validate the IC index result, a comparison has been performed with earlier flood events, two hydrological models, Multi criteria decision analysis and spatiotemporal soil parameters. From the obtained result and analysis, preliminary solutions have been proposed for two case studies in Sweden and Portugal. The result shows that IC index is promising as an, early stage, first assessment tool in NBS planning practice which can be used in order to allocate areas suitable for NBS. To find the most beneficial location and the site-specific design, a deeper investigation of the site-specific conditions is required. Moreover, a successful implementation is dependent on a close collaboration between different stakeholders and expertise. Finally, this study shows that realizing the potential of NBS wetlands is essential to create sustainable urban development and liveable and attractive cities.

AB  - Hazards in coastal ecosystems, such as flooding and land loss, demand natural and nature-based solutions from local communities due to the protective and non-protective services they provide when compared with traditionally engineered approaches. In this context, natural solutions are those that consider conserving existing habitats whereas nature-based solutions are those created by humans. These solutions support important coastal ecosystem functions, such as nutrient uptake, fisheries habitat, soil carbon storage, and surge attenuation. Our main research questions were: (1) Based on community engagement, what are the possible natural and nature-based solutions to address coastal hazards in Breton Sound Estuary, Louisiana? and (2) How do these community co-designed nature-based solutions support various ecosystem functions? To help answer these questions, we leveraged the competency group methodology to incorporate the local needs and traditional ecological knowledge of community stakeholders into collaborative ecosystem modelling. In total, fifteen members regularly met five times over an eight-month period to design nature-based solutions to address coastal hazards. Two nature-based solutions, created marshes and restored ridges, were identified most frequently by the competency group (>75% occurrence) in a final survey. Associated ecosystem functions of the identified solutions were assessed with simulation models to determine future ecosystem functions of nutrient uptake, fisheries habitat, soil carbon storage, and surge attenuation after 20 years. By adding created marshes to an ecosystem, our model results indicate slight increases in nutrient uptake, likely increases to fisheries habitat and soil carbon storage capacity, as well as storm surge attenuation in some areas following ridge restoration. Quantifying these ecosystem functions with management actions has been limited and is needed to assess how natural and nature-based solutions impact local communities and resource users. This novel approach to modeling ecosystem-based solutions through a collaborative modeling process with researchers and residents can be applied elsewhere to assess the viability of natural and nature-based solutions.

AB  - Hard engineering structures such as dikes, commonly used for coastal protection, are often associated with negative impacts on natural functioning and biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. Hybrid nature-based defences, which combine conventional hard engineered barriers with coastal ecosystems such as marshes, may offer a more sustainable, ecologically valuable and cost-effective alternative to hard engineering alone. However, uncertainties about the actual effectiveness of these nature-based measures still hampers their practical implementation. In this thesis I focussed on coastal ecosystem dynamics in relation to their coastal protection role, as well as investigating nature management strategies to optimize both the coastal protection services and the ecological value of these ecosystems. Overall, this thesis highlights that salt marshes effectively reduce wave heights reaching the dike and wave run-up onto the dikes, even if the marsh vegetation is short. Furthermore, marsh vegetation traps sediment and creates a cohesive top layer that is highly resistant to fast water flow, which is beneficial in reducing the breach depth in case of a dike failure. Only pioneer vegetation growing at sandy places is not erosion resistant, comparable to bare mudflats. Grazing by hare, geese and cattle can reduce the lateral erodibility of fine-grained marsh soils. The resulting slow cliff retreat is beneficial for flood safety, as marsh width is needed to attenuate waves. However, intensive cattle grazing can over-compact the soil, which may negatively impact the marsh resilience to sea level rise. Thus, to be beneficial, cattle grazing should be extensive. Finally, marsh expansion may be promoted by stabilizing and trapping sediment on the connected fronting tidal flats. More specifically, we found that foreshore ecosystems such as seagrass beds with high root density can reduce soil erosion, and that there is potential to change the tidal flat morphology by using artificial reefs.

AB  - Green infrastructure is being pulled in divergent directions. As climate impacts intensify, advocates are promoting larger, ecosystem-scale strategies to help mitigate flood risks. Yet, research on existing urban greening projects finds that they can cause gentrification and displacement, suggesting that smaller projects may be more desirable from an equity perspective. This essay argues that cities need both large-scale and justice-enhancing nature-based solutions. They can help overcome tensions in these goals by (1) reframing green infrastructure as a way to support community development and integrated socio-ecological landscapes, and (2) advancing metropolitan regional governance strategies that alleviate municipal fiscal imperatives to maximize local land development. These proposals suggest that the practice of green infrastructure would benefit from diversifying its ranks to include social and government policy, community development, and agroecology, as well as learning from the Global South and those currently positioned as “off the map” of technical expertise. They also point to the need for interdisciplinary research that provides an evidence base for more transformative social, ecological, and governance strategies. While the essay focuses on the US context, it is relevant to an international audience given that similar challenges confront cities worldwide and that it highlights how the Global North can learn from the Global South.

AB  - Great Bay Boulevard, located on the Tuckerton Peninsula in Ocean County, NJ, is a coastal roadway experiencing increased closures due to flood events. The project team explored the use of green infrastructure solutions that could simultaneously mitigate future roadway flooding and maintain marsh health over time. Thin layer placement of sediment could raise the marsh platform elevation in vulnerable locations along the road. A combination of oyster beds and native plants could be placed along the marsh edge to reduce overall wave energy at the site.

AB  - Globally, with the growing importance of mangroves for providing ecosystem services and mitigating climate change, it is still uncertain whether planted mangroves can be the counterpart of natural mangroves, and thus the role of planted mangroves is still less understood. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the stand structure and carbon storage of a young mangrove plantation in Satkhira District, Bangladesh and to compare it with the natural mangrove forest (i.e., Sundarbans) to understand the potential of this young mangrove plantation as a nature-based solution to climate change. In addition, to better understand the spatial dynamics of afforested mangrove forests, we investigated and compared both above and below-ground carbon stocks between the landward and riverward sites. We collected both above (height and diameter at breast height, DBH) and belowground (i.e., coarse and fine root) data from 16 plots with a total area of 1600 m2 in two paired transects, eight plots each in landward and riverward sites. Aboveground carbon stocks were estimated using the species-specific allometric models from the biophysical tree parameters (i.e., height and DBH). Besides, belowground root (≥ 20 mm) carbon was measured by direct weighting after collecting soil samples through coring. Stand structural attributes (i.e., density, basal area, and DBH) showed a significant difference between the two sites, whereas Sonneratia apetala was found as the dominant species (IV = 188.7∼207.1) in both forest sites. The mean carbon stock of this plantation was 49.1 Mg C ha−1, while the mean aboveground carbon (AGC) was 37.3 Mg C ha−1. The landward site contributed significantly more AGC (40.1 Mg C ha−1) than the riverward (34.4 Mg C ha−1) site (p<0.05). Besides, the mean belowground roots carbon (BGRC) of this plantation was 11.8 ± 1.4 Mg C ha−1, where the riverward site contributed significantly more root carbon (14.3 Mg C ha−1) than the landward site (9.4 Mg C ha−1) (p<0.05). Tree density and basal area showed a significant positive relationship with BGRC. Although only two species were planted, after 15 years, we observed the total number of species reached nine. The carbon stock, progressive species richness in this plantation reflects the significance of young mangrove plantations in sequestering carbon to mitigate climate change and biodiversity conservation as nature-based solutions which may be useful for future coastal afforestation and restoration programs.

AB  - Globally, there is growing interest in restoring previously widespread oyster reefs to reinstate key ecosystem services such as shoreline protection, fisheries productivity and water filtration. Yet, since peak expiration of oysters in the 1800s, significant and ongoing environmental change has occurred. Estuaries and coasts, are undergoing some of the highest rates of urbanisation, warming and ocean acidification on the planet, necessitating novel approaches to restoration. Here, we review key design considerations for oyster reef restoration projects that maximise the probability that they will meet biological and socio-economic goals not only under present-day conditions, but into the future. This includes selection of sites, and where required, substrates and oyster species and genotypes for seeding, not only on the basis of their present and future suitability in supporting oyster survival, growth and reproduction, but also based on their match to specific goals of ecosystem service delivery. Based on this review, we provide a road map of design considerations to maximise the success of future restoration projects.

AB  - Globally, shoreline protection approaches are evolving towards the incorporation of natural and nature-based features (living shorelines henceforth) as a preferred alternative to shoreline armoring. Emerging research suggests that living shorelines may be a viable approach to conserving coastal habitats (marshes, beaches, shallows, seagrasses) along eroding shorelines. Living shorelines typically involve the use of coastal habitats, such as wetlands, that have a natural capacity to stabilize the shore, restore or conserve habitat, and maintain coastal processes. They provide stability while still being dynamic components of the ecosystem, but due to their dynamic nature, careful designs and some maintenance will be required if habitat conservation is a goal. Living shorelines may represent a singular opportunity for habitat conservation in urban and developing estuaries because of their value to society as a shoreline protection approach and resilience to sea level rise. However, enhanced public acceptance and coordination among regulatory and advisory authorities will be essential to expand their use. To fully understand their significance as habitat conservation strategies, systematic and standardized monitoring at both regional and national scales is vital to evaluate the evolution, persistence, and maximum achievable functionality (e.g., ecosystem service provision) of living shoreline habitats.

AB  - Globally, rising seas threaten massive numbers of people and significant infrastructure. Adaptation strategies increasingly incorporate nature-based solutions. New science can illuminate where these solutions are appropriate in urban environments and what benefits they provide to people. Together with stakeholders in San Mateo County, California, USA, we co-developed nature-based solutions to support adaptation planning. We created six guiding principles to shape planning, summarized vulnerability to sea-level rise and opportunities for nature-based solutions, created three adaptation scenarios, and compared multiple benefits provided by each scenario. Adaptation scenarios that included investments in nature-based solutions deliver up to eight times the benefits of a traditionally engineered baseline as well as additional habitat for key species. The magnitude and distribution of benefits varied at subregional scales along the coastline. Our results demonstrate practical tools and engagement approaches to assessing the multiple benefits of nature-based solutions in an urban estuary that can be replicated in other regions.

AB  - Global vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs) represent a large sink for organic carbon (OC) stored within their soils. The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil OC stocks from Chinese VCHs have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global OC sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil OC stocks, burial rates and losses of VCHs in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low OC stocks, storing 6.3 ± 0.6, 7.5 ± 0.6, and 1.6 ± 0.6 Tg C (±95% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 ± 17, 159 ± 57, and 6 ± 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil OC stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2-395.4 Tg CO2 e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management.

AB  - Global environmental factors (e.g., extreme weather, climate action failure, natural disasters, human environmental damage) increasingly threaten coastal communities. Shorelines are often hardened (seawalls, bulkheads) to prevent flooding and erosion and protect coastal communities. However, hardened shorelines lead to environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. Developmental pressures that are growing in scale, scope, and complexity necessitate the development of sustainable solutions to work with, rather than against, nature. Such nature-based solutions (NBS) provide protection and improve environmental quality and enhance biodiversity. To further this pressing need into action, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began the Engineering With Nature (EWN) initiative to balance economic, environmental, and social benefits through collaboration with partners and stakeholders. This work shows how engineering practice can be advanced through structured decision-making and landscape architecture renderings that include ecological sciences and NBS into an integrated approach for enhancing biodiversity in coastal marine environments. This integrated approach can be applied when designing new infrastructure projects or modifying or repairing existing infrastructure. To help communicate designs incorporating NBS, drawings, and renderings showcasing EWN concepts can aid decision-making. Our experiences with implementing EWN in practice have revealed that involving landscape architects can play a crucial role in successful collaboration and lead to solutions that protect coastal communities while preserving or enhancing biodiversity.

AB  - Global environmental change is currently threatening many estuaries and tidal lagoons worldwide with significant ecological and socio-economical losses for our coastal communities. Several studies have emphasized the coastal protection functions of intertidal and subtidal vegetated surfaces, but their influence on the resilience of tidal back-barrier basins is understudied. Understanding the non-linear feedbacks and the large-scale effects induced by the disappearence of salt marshes and seagrass beds on sediment dynamics and hydrodynamic circulation is a critical step to predicting future impacts of sea-level rise on coastal areas and is highly topical given the current interest in wetland restoration around the world. Here, I have first explored the effects associated with salt marsh removal on sediment transport processes and tidal dynamics in shallow estuaries, employing a metaanalysis of high-resolution numerical modeling results in six lagoon-type estuaries spanning the entire Northeastern shore of the USA. In the second part of this work, I have unraveled the fate of salt marsh-derived sediments generated by wave-induced edge erosion in a small estuary located in New York City using the numerical framework COAWST. Finally, I have explored how changes in bottom friction associated with seagrass disappearance affect the sediment budget of coastal bays through local and regional changes in hydrodynamics. The main results from this dissertation highlighted that: I) salt marsh loss reduces the ability of shallow estuaries to retain sediment inputs through changes in the regional scale hydrodynamics; II) a fascinating non-linear relationship exists between salt marsh sediment trapping capacity and salt marsh size, which strongly affects the adaptive capacity of these coastal ecosystems to sea-level rise; III) only a small fraction of the sediment generated by salt marsh lateral erosion is trapped by vegetated marsh platforms; IV) reductions in seagrass coverage destabilize estuarine systems, increasing the flood phase in areas affected by seagrass disappearance and increasing bed-shear stress values across the entire back-barrier basin; V) seagrass beds reduce the wave thrust acting along salt marsh boundaries; VI) the location of the seagrass patch, in addition to its areal extent, plays an important role in attenuating wave energy along the shoreline; and VI) seagrass presence decreases the suspended sediment concentrations in the water column and consequently the sediment stock on salt marsh platforms.

AB  - Global changes such as sea level rise and enhanced storminess motivate the use of saltmarshes as nature-based flood defenses. Yet it remains poorly understood about how shifted environmental conditions may shape processes governing long-term stability of saltmarshes. Here we integrated data from in situ measurements and field experiments in several Dutch salt marshes to probe the impacts of changes in tides and winds on seed arrival and seed retention on adjacent tidal flats, which is key to marsh regeneration following wave-driven lateral erosion. The results show that both the quantity and viability of the seeds transported towards adjacent tidal flats relate positively with the peak water level of each tide. Spring tides are more powerful in seed dispersal than neap tides, and storm-induced extreme water levels can serve as ‘Window of Opportunity’ that deliver disproportionately higher amounts of viable seeds than average conditions. Seed retention decreased with growing onshore wind speed. Storm-induced strong wave disturbance can function as ‘Windows of Risk’ that wipe out seeds on tidal flats at wind-exposed marshes. This study highlights the importance of variability in tides and winds for regulating the potential of seed-based marsh recovery on adjacent tidal flats and thus their resilience to lateral degradation. These findings are relevant for assessing the long-term marsh stability and sustainability of nature-based coastal defenses with saltmarshes under global environmental changes.

AB  - Global change amplifies coastal flood risks and motivates a paradigm shift towards nature-based coastal defence, where engineered structures are supplemented with coastal wetlands such as saltmarshes. Although experiments and models indicate that such natural defences can attenuate storm waves, there is still limited field evidence on how much they add safety to engineered structures during severe storms. Using well-documented historic data from the 1717 and 1953 flood disasters in Northwest Europe, we show that saltmarshes can reduce both the chance and impact of the breaching of engineered defences. Historic lessons also reveal a key but unrecognized natural flood defence mechanism: saltmarshes lower flood magnitude by confining breach size when engineered defences have failed, which is shown to be highly effective even with long-term sea level rise. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms and benefits of nature-based mitigation of flood hazards, and should stimulate the development of novel safety designs that smartly harness different natural coastal defence functions.

AB  - Given a lot of elusive information on the use and implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in the Global South, this review provides a synthesis of the evidence on the: - (1) distribution of urban green technologies in form of arboriculture and urban agriculture as a part of NbS packages for the sustainability of cities against population growth and impact of climate change; and (2) options of integrating and mainstreaming various NbS packages into city development policies, planning processes, and decision-making agendas. The sustainability of urban green as part of NbS packages and the usefulness for improvement of livelihoods is determined by the spatial (geographical location) and temporal (time of action) scales, and socio-ecological and institutional factors. Various NbS packages have shown the ability for use as climate change adaptation measures throughout the world. These functions include protection from soil erosion, protection from inland flooding, buffering natural resources against drier and more variable climates, protection from coastal hazards and sea-level rise, moderation of urban heatwaves and effects of heat island, and managing storm-water and flooding in urban areas. Furthermore, the benefits of urban agriculture and arboriculture include use as sources of food and generation of income; improve recreation and social interactions, and the sustainability of biodiversity. They also mitigate the impact of environmental pollution and climate change through reduction of gas emissions and act as carbon sinks. While the starting capital and lack of policy on urban agriculture and arboriculture in many countries, the importance of the industry is inevitably a useful agenda especially in the Global South due to vulnerability to the impact of climate change. This review also suggests the inclusion of all institutions, governments, and relevant stakeholders to emphasize gender sensitization at all levels of planning and decision-making in food production and adaptation measures to climate change.

AB  - From the advent of civilization, humans have tried to interpret nature and build systems of studies, branches of science, and arts to best adapt to the way the planet functions. The coast, which is the transition from the sea to landmasses, has been engineered by nature to support terrestrial habitats and life; mangroves act as sentinels to protect and safeguard them. The unique adaptive features of these mangrove species, which exist as forest communities – Mangals – are natural systems of engineering that stabilize the shore and help the delta mature. Mangroves have unique root systems, known as stilt roots, and lateral branching roots that help anchor and accrete silt, thereby determining the formation of the landmass in typical geo-morpho-hydrological systems where riverine freshwater readily mixes with saline ocean waters. The use of mangroves for such natural shoreline engineering and protection is shown as a case study in the Sundarban.

AB  - From a comprehensive diagnosis of the associated basins, islands, and wetlands of the coastal lagoon system of Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia, this work describes feasible options for the recovery of its ecosystem’s health and ecological resilience. Firstly, the state of the coastal lagoon was assessed, finding that hydrology, wave climate, and the morphological changes of the coastline explain recent changes in the coastal wetlands. Key variables were used to describe the level of conservation or degradation of the coastal lagoon system and to identify measures to improve its ecological functions. Finally, to mimic some of these functions and improve connectivity of the ecosystems, green infrastructure alternatives were proposed for the short and medium term to recover the services of these ecosystems and restore their resilience.

AB  - Freshwater impounded wetlands are created by artificially restricting coastal wetlands connection to tides. The decrease in salinity and altered hydrology can significantly increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically methane (CH4). Restoration of freshwater impounded wetlands through tidal reintroduction can potentially reduce GHG emissions; however, studies in tropical regions are scare. This study investigates the potential for tidal restoration of impounded freshwater coastal wetlands by comparing their GHG emissions with tidally connected mangrove and saltmarshes in the Burdekin catchment in Queensland, Australia. We found that freshwater impounded wetlands had significantly higher CH4 emissions (3,633 ± 812 μg CH4 m−2 hour−1) than mangroves (27 ± 8 μg CH4 m−2 hour−1) and saltmarsh (13 ± 8 μg CH4 m−2 hour−1). Soil redox, moisture, carbon, nitrogen, and bulk density were all significantly correlated to methane emissions. Conversely, freshwater impounded wetlands had significantly lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (−0.72 ± 0.18 μg N2O m−2 hour−1) than mangroves and saltmarsh (0.35 ± 0.29 and 1.32 ± 0.52 μg N2O m−2 hour−1 respectively). Nevertheless, when converting to CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq), freshwater impounded wetlands emitted 91 ± 20 g CO2-eq m−2 hour−1, compared to the much lower 0.8 ± 0.2 and 0.7 ± 0.2 g CO2-eq m−2 hour−1 emission rates for mangroves and saltmarsh. In conclusion, restoration of freshwater impounded wetlands through tidal restoration is likely to result in reduced GHG emissions.

AB  - Fossil fuels, i.e., petroleum, natural gas, and coal, are the primary sources of global energy. Studies on the impacts of fossil fuels on climate change have shown the immediate need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adopt sustainable alternatives since these emissions result in warmer atmospheric temperatures, ocean acidification, glacier melting, sea level rise, and many other ramifications. In recent years, these alarming results have prompted governments worldwide to develop adaptation strategies for climate change, leading to increased investments in renewable energy resources. Globally, solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower have been the leading sources of renewable energy. Ocean wave energy, however, has become increasingly recognized as another promising source of electricity, as waves contain as much as 2 TW of power and offer a highly predictable energy resource in comparison to more conventional sources. Wave energy can be converted into electricity by Wave Energy Converters (WECs). WECs extract energy from the motion of surface waves or fluctuations in the water pressure below the ocean surface. Surface waves or pressure fluctuations drive a generator or a power take-off system, allowing the energy of the waves to be converted into electricity. WECs are commonly configured in arrays, i.e., wave farms, to increase the span across which waves can be captured and optimize the use of materials such as underwater cables used to transfer the generated electricity to the shore. There are various types of WECs based on various physical principles and their efficiencies of converting the total available wave power into electricity range from 20-40%. For any given location, the most suitable type should be determined for deployment based on the coastal region's local needs and characteristics, such as the bathymetry, wave climate, coastline properties, and marine life. Wave energy conversion technologies have recently attracted more attention as part of global efforts to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy resources. While ocean waves can provide renewable energy, they can also be destructive for the coastal areas that are usually densely populated and vulnerable to coastal erosion. There have been a variety of efforts to mitigate the impacts of wave- and storm-induced erosion; however, they are either temporary solutions or approaches that are not able to adapt to changing climate. It is only recently recognized that traditional coastal protection methods may not be adequate in adapting to climate change, and diverse defense methods employing nature-based solutions and non-invasive technology (e.g. wave farms and electric reefs) are needed. This dissertation explores a green and sustainable approach to mitigating coastal erosion from hurricanes through wave energy conversion in a changing climate, i.e., rising sea levels. The potential use of wave energy converter farms to mitigate erosion while generating renewable energy is explored through simulations using the numerical model, XBeach. It is shown that wave farms can impact coastal morphodynamics and have the potential to reduce dune and beach erosion. The capacity of wave farms to influence coastal morphodynamics varies with the storm intensity.

AB  - For too long, implicit acceptance of and assumptions about colonial property rights have directed the flow of adaptation policy pathways. Though there is increasing recognition of the challenges that flow from private property rights for effective, long term adaptation planning, there is yet to be sustained and systematic attention to how property rights act as a mechanism that entrenches maladaptive tendencies by further embedding path dependency. This is complicated by law, which on the one hand is thought of as a vehicle to help institutionalise adaptative capacity, but on the other embodies and amplifies property rights. Property discourses are embedding a dominant property rights path dependency for coastal climate adaptation. This path dependency entrenches an incremental approach to coastal governance, with normative ideas on private property rights and the path dependencies they create, underpinning managed retreat theory and action. Lessons from case studies in coastal locations in Australia provide important insights into future behaviours of property owners. These insights are useful as coastal management strategies seek to embrace climate change adaptation, and as the financial sector reassesses climate risk exposure.

AB  - For millennia, coastal and marine ecosystems have adapted and flourished in the Red Sea’s unique environment. Surrounded by deserts on all sides, the Red Sea is subjected to high dust inputs and receives very little freshwater input, and so harbors a high salinity. Coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangroves flourish in this environment and provide socio-economic and environmental benefits to the bordering coastlines and countries. Interestingly, while coral reef ecosystems are currently experiencing rapid decline on a global scale, those in the Red Sea appear to be in relatively better shape. That said, they are certainly not immune to the stressors that cause degradation, such as increasing ocean temperature, acidification and pollution. In many regions, ecosystems are already severely deteriorating and are further threatened by increasing population pressure and large coastal development projects. Degradation of these marine habitats will lead to environmental costs, as well as significant economic losses. Therefore, it will result in a missed opportunity for the bordering countries to develop a sustainable blue economy and integrate innovative nature-based solutions. Recognizing that securing the Red Sea ecosystems’ future must occur in synergy with continued social and economic growth, we developed an action plan for the conservation, restoration, and growth of marine environments of the Red Sea. We then investigated the level of resources for financial and economic investment that may incentivize these activities. This study presents a set of commercially viable financial investment strategies, ecological innovations, and sustainable development opportunities, which can, if implemented strategically, help ensure long-term economic benefits while promoting environmental conservation. We make a case for investing in blue natural capital and propose a strategic development model that relies on maintaining the health of natural ecosystems to safeguard the Red Sea’s sustainable development.

AB  - For centuries, corals reefs in the South Pacific Islands have been essential to the well-being and livelihood of Pacific Islanders. Resources from coral reefs constitute essential components of the diet of the people of these Pacific Islands. Nowadays, coral reefs continue to support income-generating activities such as fisheries and tourism, thus playing a significant role in the economies of many Pacific Islands. This chapter is an attempt to demonstrate, based on recent literature review and various reports, the current conditions of some of the reefs in selected islands of the Pacific. It also offers further insights into challenges and issues that affect tourism development and the overall regional effort by relevant organisations to mitigate impacts and ensure sustainability of future reef activities.

AB  - Floods are the most devastating of global natural disasters, and flood adaptation measures are needed to reduce future risk. Researchers have started to evaluate the costs and benefits of flood adaptation, but information regarding the cost of different flood adaptation measures is often not available or is hidden in non-peer-reviewed literature. Recent review studies have explored cost estimates for different aspects of flood adaptation, such as nature-based solutions. This study aims to contribute empirical data regarding the cost of flood adaptation by compiling peer-reviewed literature and research reports. The focus is on construction costs and expenses for operation and maintenance. This paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016). Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.

AB  - Flooding simulation across shallow waters and lowlands has been successful for the diagnosis and prognosis of the submerged land areas during extreme sea water levels. However this method is traditionally implemented to linear transects (1D) of discretely-measured topobathymetry or medium-to-coarse-grained 2D modelling. This research aims at mapping the coastal flooding risk at very high spatial resolution (1 m) by simulating hazardous cyclonic waves on exposed lands and vulnerable buildings using a combination of satellite-derived topobathymetry, wave transformation and overflow modelling. Applied to the Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia), the topobathymetry mapping resulted from the merging of the topography derived from the Pleiades-1 stereo-photogrammetry (R2=0.84) and bathymetry retrieved from the Pleiades-1 radiative transfer modelling (R2=0.71). Associated with the exposure index, the wave simulation of the 1983-cyclone Orama-Nisha produced hazardous heights of 1.78 m before the swash area, what enabled the lowlands' submersion to be mapped. Focused on churches and houses' vulnerability, the standardized flooding risk has been mapped at 1 m, accurately informing the near-future planning for this atoll area.

AB  - Flood risks are increasing worldwide due to climate change and ongoing economic and demographic development in coastal areas. Salt marshes can function as vegetated foreshores that reduce wave loads on coastal structures such as dikes and dams, thereby mitigating current and future flood risk. This paper aims to quantify long-term (100 years) flood risk reduction by salt marshes. Dike-foreshore configurations are assessed by coupled calculations of wave energy dissipation over the foreshore, sediment accretion under sea level rise, the probability of dike failure, and life-cycle costs. Rising sea levels lead to higher storm waves, and increasing probabilities of dike failure by wave overtopping. This study shows that marsh elevation change due to sediment accretion mitigates the increase in wave height, thereby elongating the lifetime of a dike-foreshore system. Further, different human interventions on foreshores are assessed in this paper: realization of a vegetated foreshore via nourishment, addition of a detached earthen breakwater, addition of an unnaturally high zone, or foreshore build-up by application of brushwood dams that enhance sediment accretion. The performance of these strategies is compared to dike heightening for the physical boundary conditions at an exposed dike along the Dutch Wadden Sea. Cost-effectiveness depends on three main factors. First, wave energy dissipation, which is lower for salt marshes with a natural elevation in the intertidal zone, when compared to foreshores with a high zone or detached breakwater. Second, required costs for construction and maintenance. Continuous maintenance costs and delayed effects on flood risk make sheltering structures less attractive from a flood risk perspective. Third, economic value of the protected area, where foreshores are particularly cost-effective for low economic value. Concluding, life-cycle cost analysis demonstrates that, within certain limits, foreshore construction can be more cost-effective than dike heightening.

AB  - Flood risk reduction in coastal areas is traditionally approached from a conventional engineering perspective, where dikes and dams are built to withstand the forces of tides, surges and waves. Recently, a nature-based approach to flood risk reduction is increasingly promoted, in which the benefits of coastal ecosystems for reducing the impact of extreme weather events are utilized. Ecosystems such as salt marshes, mangrove forests, coral reefs and sand dunes are preserved, enhanced or even created, in order to reduce flood risk in coastal areas. Nature-based flood defenses can work stand-alone, like sand dunes, but can also function in combination with engineered defenses, for example when vegetated foreshores reduce wave loads on dikes or dams. The focus of this dissertation is on the case of hybrid flood defenses, where wave loads on a coastal dike or dam are reduced by a salt marsh, which functions as a vegetated foreshore in front of the engineered structure. There is limited knowledge on the functioning and stability of vegetated foreshores under severe storm conditions. Further, these natural systems are characterized by relatively high temporal and spatial variations. The lack of knowledge and high variability lead to a relatively high degree of uncertainty in flood risk reduction potential, compared to engineered structures. Uncertainty propagates into the failure probability of hybrid flood defenses. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to develop methods to assess how and how much nature-based flood defenses can reduce flood risks, taking into account uncertainties in their functioning and stability. First, the effects of vegetated foreshores on wave heights, wave run-up and wave overtopping discharge were investigated, focusing on storm conditions. Wave energy dissipation was continuously measured for a period of approximately three years (2014- 2017) on various salt marshes in the Western Scheldt estuary and in the Wadden Sea, both located in the Netherlands. The resulting dataset includes storms, with higher significant wave heights (maximum 0.85 m) and water depths (maximum 3.07 m) at the marsh edge than reported in any previous field study on wave attenuation by salt marshes. High wave attenuation rates over 50% per 300 m of marsh width were recorded during storms, notwithstanding reduced aboveground biomass in winter. The process of wave energy dissipation was investigated, using the spectral wave model SWAN, which is able to distinguish different energy dissipation mechanisms such as depth-induced wave breaking, wave attenuation by standing vegetation, and bottom friction. Model results showed that wave energy dissipation was primarily caused by wave attenuation by vegetation and (to a lesser extent) by wave breaking. Observed wave attenuation by Spartina anglica (common cord-grass) and Scirpus maritimus (sea clubrush) vegetation under storm conditions could best be described in the SWAN model by a calibrated bulk drag coefficient CeD ≈ 0.4. The calibrated SWAN model was subsequently applied in combination with empirical EurOtop formulas, to predict how foreshores affect wave run-up and wave overtopping discharge at coastal dikes. This approach demonstrated that vegetated foreshores reduce wave loads on coastal dikes significantly. Pronounced reductions in wave runup and wave overtopping were found, especially for situations with a large wave height to water depth ratio on the foreshore. Wave attenuation by vegetation has most added value at water depths for which waves are close to breaking, provided that the vegetation remains stable under the wave forcing.

AB  - Flood defense strategies have evolved from hard-engineered systems to nature-based solutions that advocate for sustainability to meet today’s environmental, social, and economic goals. This paper aims to analyze the historical progression and evolutionary trends in flood control strategies that have led to nature-based solutions. An evaluative literature review was conducted to narrate the evolution of nature-based flood management approaches for different flood types, river floods, coastal floods, and stormwater run-offs. The analysis reflected three evolutionary trends: the transformation of hard measures to soft measures; secondly, the increase in society’s attention to ecosystems and their services; and, finally, divergence from single-function solutions to multi-function solutions. However, continuous monitoring and evaluation of the previous projects and adapting to the lessons learned are the key to progress towards sustainable flood management strategies and their societal acceptance.

AB  - Faced with sea level rise and the intensification of extreme events, human populations living on the coasts are developing responses to address local situations. A synthesis of the literature on responses to coastal adaptation allows us to highlight different adaptation strategies. Here, we analyze these strategies according to the complexity of their implementation, both institutionally and technically. First, we distinguish two opposing paradigms – fighting against rising sea levels or adapting to new climatic conditions; and second, we observe the level of integrated management of the strategies. This typology allows a distinction between four archetypes with the most commonly associated governance modalities for each. We then underline the need for hybrid approaches and adaptation trajectories over time to take into account local socio-cultural, geographical, and climatic conditions as well as to integrate stakeholders in the design and implementation of responses. We show that dynamic and participatory policies can foster collective learning processes and enable the evolution of social values and behaviors. Finally, adaptation policies rely on knowledge and participatory engagement, multi-scalar governance, policy monitoring, and territorial solidarity. These conditions are especially relevant for densely populated areas that will be confronted with sea level rise, thus for coastal cities in particular.

AB  - Exposure to coastal flooding is increasing due to growing population and economic activity. These developments go hand-in-hand with a loss and deterioration of ecosystems. Ironically, these ecosystems can play a buffering role in reducing flood hazard. The ability of ecosystems to contribute to reducing coastal flooding has been emphasized in multiple studies. However, the role of ecosystems in hybrid coastal protection (i.e. a combination of ecosystems and levees) has been poorly quantified at a global scale. Here, we evaluate the use of coastal vegetation, mangroves, and marshes fronting levees to reduce global coastal protection costs, by accounting for wave-vegetation interaction.The research is carried out by combining earth observation data and hydrodynamic modelling. We show that incooperating vegetation in hybrid coastal protection results in more sustainable and financially attractive coastal protection strategies. If vegetated foreshore levee systems were established along populated coastlines susceptible to flooding, the required levee crest height could be considerably reduced. This would result in a reduction of 320 (range: 107-961) billion USD2005 Power Purchasing Parity (PPP) in investments, of which 67.5 (range: 22.5- 202) billion USD2005 PPP in urban areas for a 1 in 100-year flood protection level.

AB  - Executive Summary: Vietnam currently ranks 21st in the world for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 2nd in ASEAN, after Indonesia. Accordingly, the Government of Vietnam is always interested in developing and implementing national programmes and policies in response to climate change. To date, Vietnam is one of the few countries that has increased its contribution to GHG emissions reduction in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2020. Through its NDC, the Government of Vietnam has indicated that the forestry sector is expected to play a significant role in mitigating climate change. The NDC and existing forestry policies emphasize the role of Payments for Forest Environmental Services (PFES) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) development as means for achieving this ambitious target. Over the past 10 years of preparation for REDD+ readiness and implementation, Vietnam has made great strides in capacity building for stakeholders and refining national REDD+ benefitsharing design, safeguards and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV). Vietnamese policymakers also advocate following strict protection of natural forests, focusing on the development of planted forests and using the multifaceted environmental values of forests, including emissions reduction and forest carbon sequestration services. However, Vietnam has struggled to achieve economic development in a sustainable manner and prevent adverse impacts from environmental degradation and climate change. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many people have entered forests to harvest timber and other forest products for earnings, making forest protection difficult. Practical implementation of well-intended policies has been characterized by numerous failures and weaknesses. Many policy measures are compromised by limited funding for forest protection, weak local governance capacity, poor vertical and horizontal coordination, low involvement of the poor, women and indigenous groups, low economic returns, elite capture of land and benefits, and corruption. Despite widespread awareness of these issues and concerted efforts by government and donors to address them, effective solutions are yet to be found. This report identifies the drivers of deforestation and degradation in Vietnam, and then analyses aspects of the social, political and institutional context that might constrain or support the design and implementation of REDD+ in Vietnam. The study also aims to increase understanding of the national and provincial governing bodies, how they interact, their knowledge and capacity to engage in and implement REDD+ and identify gaps in stakeholders’ capacity to implement REDD+. The recommendations contained in this report are intended for project investors and organizations who have interest in developing and implementing emission reduction and REDD+ projects in Vietnam.

AB  - Executive summary: This policy insight illustrates the challenges faced by many coastal cities in tackling the interwoven issues of demographic growth, climate change and waste management. With a focus on Mombasa, Kenya, it looks at how the priority climate hazards of flooding and sea-level rise interact with water and solid waste, and focuses on the potential for naturebased solutions. Treating grey water through constructed wetlands, revegetating urban zones to optimise the benefits residents receive from natural spaces, and investing in mangrove fringes for coastal protection, water treatment and blue carbon finance provide opportunities for multiple co-benefits to urban residents. The latest recommendations for restoring nature down to the smallest scale (to 1km2 areas), opportunities for generating income for informal groups, and the recognised value of building social capital at neighbourhood levels may provide a golden opportunity to reinforce ecological, economic and social resilience in responding to the multiple hazards facing East African coastal cities.

AB  - Executive Summary: The environmental, social and economic impacts of climate change coupled with the unsustainable management of ecosystems, increase the vulnerabilities of people and nature. Furthermore, the crisis is likely to impact different groups differently and is expected to affect the marginalized (women, children and elderly) disproportionately. Adaptation serves as an important strategy to cope with a changing climate and its impacts; however, in response to global climate change effects, countries are likely to invest in traditional options such as infrastructure for coastal defences and flood control, and new irrigation facilities and reservoirs for water shortages. These options are likely to be costly and generally do not take the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity into account. Healthy, well-functioning ecosystems enhance natural resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change and reduce the vulnerability of people. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) offers a valuable yet under-utilized approach for climate change adaptation, complementing traditional actions such as infrastructure development. EbA uses biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people and communities adapt to the negative effects of climate change at local, national, regional, and global levels. It recognizes, and in fact highlights, the importance of equity, gender, and the role and importance of local and traditional knowledge, as well as species diversity. Furthermore, it provides co-benefits such as clean water and food for communities, risk reduction options and benefits, and other services crucial for livelihoods and human well-being. Appropriately designed ecosystem adaptation initiatives can also contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing emissions from ecosystem degradation, and enhancing carbon sequestration.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Protection and restoration of ‘blue forests’ and ‘blue meadows’ — mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes — offer nature-based solutions to absorb and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), support fisheries and reduce risks associated with floods and storms. They provide an opportunity to address multiple challenges in a single portfolio of actions. Despite the benefits they provide, blue forests and meadows have been extensively cleared, fragmented or degraded. Protecting and restoring them is therefore key to maintaining (or returning) their capacity to offer nature-based solutions to societal challenges. The nations of the Indian Ocean host a substantial proportion of the world’s blue forests and meadows (for example, together they contain almost half of the world’s mangrove forests), but they also include hotspots where the rate of loss of these ecosystems is greatest. They have more to gain than many other regions: millions of people live along coasts which are at extreme risk from natural disasters like storms and tsunamis and rely heavily on the seafood they produce as their primary source of protein. However, generating the money to fund protection and restoration efforts can be difficult. Partnerships with the private sector can help attract the money needed. Indeed, many actors in the private sector want to support these efforts, with motivations that range from broad corporate social responsibility to generating income from new revenue streams. With considerable blue forest resources and expanding blue economies, the nations of the Indian Ocean could lead the world in blue forest finance. An impediment to attracting private sector finance is uncertainty about what the returns are: for example, restoring a mangrove forest can enhance carbon storage, and protect people and infrastructure from damaging storms, but the economic advantages that these confer are often not fully assessed. Another impediment is that the benefits tend to be spread widely (they are public goods) rather than to the investor, and it can be difficult to identify clear cash returns in the near term. Addressing these impediments is important. The opportunities that the private sector provide also need to be harnessed thoughtfully, keeping focus of what we are trying to achieve. This will involve consideration of what the appropriate role and limits of different sectors are in financing public goods — there is no single answer to this, and each jurisdiction should make its own decisions.

AB  - Executive Summary: Nature-based Solutions (NbS)1 – centred on the protection, restoration and sustainable management of the world’s ecosystems – have a vitally important role to play in addressing both the causes and consequences of climate change. Recent research suggests that NbS could provide around 30% of the cost-effective mitigation that is needed by 2030 to stabilise warming to below 2°C. Recent research also demonstrates how NbS can help protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change while providing a range of other benefits for society. As countries revise or prepare new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in support of the Paris Agreement in the run-up to 2020, there is a major opportunity to increase global ambition on climate change through strengthening the role of these natural solutions. To support the increased uptake of NbS in future NDCs, this report presents an overview of the current level of ambition for nature within them, and highlights what can be done further to fully harness the potential of NbS in global climate action going forward. This is based on an analysis of several major comparative assessments of nature’s prominence (biodiversity and ecosystems) in NDCs to date. We analyse the framings, methods and results of these different studies, and identify a set of clear common findings. On this basis, we develop recommendations for the consideration of policy makers on how climate ambition within future NDCs can be raised through the more substantive inclusion of NbS.

AB  - Executive Summary: Kelp forests can be found along rocky shorelines in temperate to Arctic coastlines on six continents. In Ireland, kelp dominates rocky substrata along moderately exposed coastline (approximately 3010km of 7524km of national shoreline). These ecosystems potentially provide a range of ecosystem services (ESs), including important primary and secondary production (including for commercial fisheries such as edible crab – Cancer pagurus) in local or adjacent habitats, carbon fixation and sequestration, and protection of coastal habitats via physical attenuation of wave action. However, there is still little known about them in this geographical range. Subtidal kelp ecosystems are dominated by cuvie (Laminaria hyperborea) and can produce up to 19.5kg wet weight m–2 of this kelp, making them an important cultural, ecological and economic resource, as well as a target for conservation across the country.

AB  - Executive Summary: Flood risk is one of the most important natural hazards in Western Balkan countries, even more severe under the ongoing climate change conditions, which in the southern Mediterranean part are pronounced by a temperature increase of nearly two degrees in the past century and lead to both an increase of moisture capacity and heavy precipitation and to longer dry seasons. Results of these climatic changes are extensive riparian inundations as well as flash flood events in most of the SEE countries. Today, about 13 % (35.170 km²) of the entire study area is prone to extensive floods and another 15 % prone to landslides.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Coastal risks are rising and at the same time we are losing coastal habitats, like mangroves, which can function as a first line of defense for coastal communities. In this study, we used an insurance industry catastrophe model to quantify the economic benefits of mangroves in Florida for reducing coastal flood damages annually in Collier County and from Hurricane Irma, which impacted Florida statewide in 2017. To quantify the value of mangroves in reducing average annual property losses in Collier County, we modelled annual surge-related losses under two scenarios: ‘With Mangroves’ and ‘Without Mangroves’. The difference in losses between the two scenarios represents the averted damages (i.e., benefits) provided by current mangroves. To quantify the flood damage reduction benefits of mangroves during Hurricane Irma we similarly estimated surge-related losses during the event for the two mangrove scenarios. To quantify surge-related flooding and losses, we first estimated storm-surge flooding (extents and heights) from each coastal storm by coupling a parametric hurricane wind-field model with a 2-D hydrodynamic flood model. The physical effect of mangroves on flood reduction was represented using a friction coefficient within the flood model. Flood damages were then estimated by combining the flood extents with an extensive property exposure and damage database. We also estimated the number of people that benefitted from flood reduction by mangroves using public census datasets. The results of this work show that mangrove forests in Florida provided significant flood damage reduction benefits annually, across multiple storms, and during catastrophic events like Hurricane Irma. In Collier County, mangroves reduced annual flood risk by 25.5% to properties behind them. Many areas in the county received over $1 million in benefits every year in flood damage reduction benefits due to the mangroves in front of them. The value of mangrove forests during Hurricane Irma was also very high. Mangroves averted $1.5 billion in storm damages, amounting to a 25% savings in counties that have mangroves. They also protected more than 626,000 people across Florida.

AB  - Executive Summary: Coastal communities around the world experience flooding every day. Increased frequency and intensity of storm events compound local tides with storm surge (IPCC, 2013). Sunny day flooding inundates low-lying areas during extreme high tides, with a confluence of land subsidence and sea level rise (IPCC, 2014). The need for coastal resilience arises as communities and stakeholders seek solutions to remain strong when confronted with destruction from greater coastal hazards, storms, and flooding. This research strives to strengthen coral reef conservation by identifying research gaps, examine how nature-based shoreline protection from coral reef restoration aids coastal resilience, and broaden public support for natural solutions in coastal defense. The key research question for this investigation is “What criteria prioritize increased coastal resilience from coral reef restoration with living shorelines?” Through applications with socioeconomic benefit, the main objective of this research is to improve the state of coral reefs and coastal resilience, globally. Focusing on coastal community resilience, this research strives to raise awareness of the benefits and best practices from coral reef restoration. This research focuses on developing a decision support framework to analyze coral restoration sites and inform coastal resilience decisions. While previous studies investigated the role of coral reefs in shoreline protection, few offer a comprehensive approach to inform effective restoration and resilience decisions. This research concentrates on promoting the ability of communities, stakeholders, and nonprofit organizations to employ the framework to evaluate the protective benefits of coral reefs as living shorelines. Three primary research objectives guide this analytic review: (1) develop a decision support framework to inform decision making; (2) apply the analytic framework to evaluate coral restoration sites for resilience; and (3) create an information matrix to communicate results that inform restoration and resilience decisions. The research methods aim to conduct a literature review to develop baseline knowledge, consult faculty and industry advisors to guide the research, compile information to select criteria for decision making, and assemble components to form an analytic framework. For analysis, the research applies the framework to case study sites with coastal resilience data. An information matrix visually displays analytic patterns and research gaps across the framework. Finally, a report captures a descriptive review of research to analyze reef restoration sites for coastal resilience. As research findings, interest in natural and nature-based infrastructure solutions highlights the increasing demand to understand and measure the impacts of ecosystem protection and restoration efforts. Application of the framework revealed a lack of consistent data across case study sites and pointed to focus areas for future research. The methodology of the decision support framework offers a general approach, applicable to a broad range of living shorelines and restoration scenarios. Earlier research found that coral reefs dissipate 97% of the wave energy directed at shorelines and possess the capacity to keep up with sea level rise through the natural accretion of sediment (Ferrario et al., 2014; Temmerman et al., 2013; TNC, 2018). Therefore, coral reefs offer more resilient protective services than built breakwater infrastructure (TNC, 2018). Currently, 75% of coral reefs in the world face threats from local and global stresses (Burke et al., 2011). As degraded reefs absorb less wave energy, opportunity exists to restore reefs and improve coastal community resilience (CORAL, 2016). Though the information matrix analysis of this research highlighted data quality and availability limitations, the framework offers a holistic view of elements needed for coastal resilience decisions. The framework also encourages communities and stakeholders to identify criteria to measure the impacts of eco ystem protection and coral reef restoration. Knowledge and information gaps identified through this investigation offer a focus for future research to examine: (a) a closer study of coral reef bathymetry and ecological services at coral reef restoration sites; (b) the need to measure of coastal damage reduction and restoration costs, consistently across sites; (c) and clarify consistent coral reef restoration best practices for coastal protection by reef type. In conclusion, this research investigated a highly integrated problem across multiple disciplines with input from many areas of expertise. The success of this research built upon the ability to divide the issue into small steps to adapt and upgrade with additional knowledge, information, and data. The flexibility of the decision support framework enables future research to adjust the methodology for application to a wider range of restoration scenarios for societal benefit.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: • This paper provides a concise high-level scientific review and synthesis of evidence of climate-change impacts in the marine and coastal environments of the UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs) in the Caribbean and Mid-Atlantic; based on available information. • The UKOTs in the Caribbean and Mid-Atlantic are diverse in size, economic and social development, and systems of governance. They are small territories with populations ranging from approximately 5000 people to approximately 65,000. The collective permanent human population is estimated at 220,000 spread across the islands of Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. • Although these six UKOTs are negligible producers of greenhouse gases in global terms, they are highly vulnerable themselves to the impacts of climate change, because of inherent economic, ecological, and social fragilities associated with the small size of their land masses; this vulnerability is exacerbated by their geographical location that exposes them to Atlantic storms, which have been of increasing intensity since the 1980s, and more-frequent but extreme events, such as droughts. • Climate change is already impacting communities on populated UKOTs in the region. Sea-level rise, changes in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events constitute the components of climate change that are the hazards of greatest concern. In September 2017, the Caribbean was hit by some of the most ferocious Category 5 hurricanes the region has ever seen. Hurricanes Irma and Maria were responsible for widespread devastation across the UKOTs of Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The Climate Studies Group Mona (CSGM) (2020) suggests that the recent warming trend in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) will continue into the future reaching 1.76 ± 0.39°C per century under a ‘businessas-usual’ scenario. • In this paper, the three priority areas identified as the focus for consideration are: (1) Impacts on food security, fish, fishing communities; (2) changes in coral reefs and associated communities; and (3) impacts on the provision of natural coastal protection. • Habitats and ecosystems have already been seriously degraded by climate change resulting in the loss of biodiversity and shrinkage of the habitats. These impacts are exacerbated by anthropogenic activities that diminish the capabilities of ecosystems to build their own resilience to changing environmental conditions. • As climate change presents significant risks for the six Caribbean and Mid-Atlantic OTs, there is a need for substantial climate action to reduce vulnerability and exposure. • Examples of regional (nature-based) solutions/initiatives to tackle climate change impacts are highlighted. These range from evidencebased, inter-sectoral approaches to examine vulnerability and adaptive capacities of key sectors to maintain a sustainable tourism industry, development of Climate Change Adaptation Policies, mangrove rehabilitation, building adaptive capacity, and partnership between public and private sector stakeholders. • Organisational strengthening of key government agencies, adaptive capacity building of fishers, strengthening marine protected areas systems, improving the management, and sharing of data and implementing Integrated Coastal Zone Management plans are among the priorities to address climate-change risks. • While existing policies and assessments have identified priority measures, an overarching impediment is access to adequate climate financing. • Addressing climate change in the UKOTs, however, is a global responsibility, not just a matter for policy and decision-makers.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Nature-based solutions harness the power and sophistication of nature to turn environmental, social and economic challenges into innovation opportunities. They can address a variety of societal challenges in sustainable ways, with the potential to contribute to green growth, 'future-proofing' society, fostering citizen well-being, providing business opportunities and positioning Europe as a leader in world markets. 2. Nature-based solutions are actions which are inspired by, supported by or copied from nature. They have tremendous potential to be energy and resource-efficient and resilient to change, but to be successful they must be adapted to local conditions. 3. Many nature-based solutions result in multiple co-benefits for health, the economy, society and the environment, and thus they can represent more efficient and cost-effective solutions than more traditional approaches. 4. An EU Research & Innovation (R&I) agenda on nature-based solutions will enable Europe to become a world leader both in R&I and in the growing market for nature-based solutions. For this, the evidence base for the effectiveness of nature-based solutions needs to be developed and then used to implement solutions. Both need to be done in conjunction with stakeholders. The potential for transferability and upscaling of solutions also requires further investigation. There is also a need to develop a systemic approach that combines technical, business, finance, governance, regulatory and social innovation. 5. Four principal goals have been identified that can be addressed by nature-based solutions: − Enhancing sustainable urbanisation through nature-based solutions can stimulate economic growth as well as improving the environment, making cities more attractive, and enhancing human well-being. − Restoring degraded ecosystems using nature-based solutions can improve the resilience of ecosystems, enabling them to deliver vital ecosystem services and also to meet other societal challenges. − Developing climate change adaptation and mitigation using nature-based solutions can provide more resilient responses and enhance the storage of carbon. − Improving risk management and resilience using nature-based solutions can lead to greater benefits than conventional methods and offer synergies in reducing multiple risks. 6. Based on the four goals, seven nature-based solutions for R&I actions are recommended to be taken forward by the European Commission and Member States: − Urban regeneration through nature-based solutions − Nature-based solutions for improving well-being in urban areas − Establishing nature-based solutions for coastal resilience − Multi-functional nature-based watershed management and ecosystem restoration − Nature-based solutions for increasing the sustainability of the use of matter and energy − Nature-based solutions for enhancing the insurance value of ecosystems − Increasing carbon sequestration through nature-based solutions This report was produced by the Horizon 2020 Expert Group on 'Nature-Based Solutions and ReNaturing Cities', informed by the findings of an e-consultation and a stakeholder workshop.

AB  - Estuaries have a long historical burden as a destination for contaminants from urban and industrial wastewater, with the vast majority untreated. The high concentration of contaminants becomes toxic to the fauna and flora, affecting the diversity and abundance of benthic macrofauna communities, some of which are dominated by species that are not tolerant to physical and chemical alterations. It is essential to understand the effects of this historical contamination on benthic estuarine communities and take actions to minimize such effects. It is in this context that the RemediGrass pilot project was carried out, with the aim to recolonize seagrass beds (Zostera noltei) as a Green and Blue Infrastructure to bioremediate the historical mercury (Hg) contamination of Laranjo Bay, at Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). To evaluate the role of seagrass recolonization as a Nature Based Solution (NBS) for ecosystem restoration, the project takes advantage of the privileged field conditions and contamination gradient. The goal is to promote local biodiversity, while minimizing the impacts of the historical contamination. Within this framework, we compared the benthic communities along the presence-absence continuum of the seagrass in two areas, one located at a well-established seagrass meadow and another at the historical contaminated area, where a seagrass transplant was held. The results demonstrated a strong influence of the seagrass meadow on the benthic communities’ diversity and abundance along the spatial gradient. The highest diversity was observed in the well established Zostera noltei meadows, compared to the other areas. In the historical contamination area, it is also evident the influence of the Z. noltei presence, yet on a smaller level. Despite the differences on community indicators not being as expressive as expected, some key species such as Peringia ulvae, Hediste diversicolor and Scrobicularia plana followed that continuum, with an increase in abundance from Bare mudflats to Zostera sites, particularly in the recolonization area.

AB  - Estuaries and coasts (hereafter, coasts) host some of the most biologically productive ecosystems on Earth (Mann 1982 ), where a diversity of geomorphological processes create coastal landforms that range from wave dominated hard rock cliff s, shore platforms, and sandy beaches to more vegetated tide dominated landforms such as saltmarshes and mangrove forests. These habitats provide a wide range of critical ecosystem services (hereafter, ES) and natural habitat value for society for food, recreation, and for resilience against the damaging eff ects of fl oods and storms on urban communities (Barbier et al. 2011 ). However, there is a notable lack of coverage of coasts in urban ecology discourse, which is surprising given the high levels of population growth and urbanization at the coast (Neumann et al. 2015 ). This chapter: 1. Outlines the spectrum of key coastal landforms and the social/ ecological benefi ts they provide. 2. Identifi es how nature- based analogues of these natural systems can be used in place of, or in concert with, traditional ‘gray’, hard engineering solutions in urban coastal settings. 3. Discusses the challenges and opportunities inherent in using natural and/ or naturebased habitats to improve ecological and resilience outcomes in urban coastal settings.

AB  - Erosion processes threaten the economy, the environment and the ecosystem of coastal areas. In addition, human action can significantly affect the characteristics of the soil and the landscape of the shoreline. In this context, pursuing environmental sustainability is of paramount importance in solving environmental degradation of coastal areas worldwide, with particular reference to the design of complex engineering structures. Among all the measures conceived to protect the shoreline, environmentally friendly interventions should be supported by the stakeholders and tested by means of mathematical models, in order to evaluate their effectiveness in coastal protection through the evaluation of wave damping and bedload. This study focuses on protected nourishments, as strategic interventions aimed to counteract coastal erosion without affecting the environment. Here, we develop a simplified method to provide a preliminary assessment of the efficiency of submerged breakwaters in reducing wave energy at a relatively low computational cost, if compared to the standard 2D or full 3D mathematical models. The methodology is applied at Calabaia Beach, located in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), in the area of the Marine Experimental Station of Capo Tirone. The results show that the simplified method is proven to be an essential tool in assisting researchers and institutions to address the effects of submerged breakwaters on nourishment protection.

AB  - Erosion and flooding are the most visible consequences of coastal zone degradation in West Africa. Man-made and natural processes, aggravated by the effects of climate change, cause erosion and flooding. These threatened densely populated coasts, the nerve center of the region's demographic and economic growth. Every year, coastal degradation takes a heavy toll on human life and socio-economic prosperity. Moreover, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections suggest that coastal erosion and flooding in West Africa is set to increase in the 21st century. Understanding the hazards and managing the coastline sustainably is a major challenge for the development of the region. The West Africa Coastal Areas Management Program (WACA) supports ongoing efforts led by countries and regional institutions to strengthen the resilience of communities and ecosystems. This is achieved by providing financing, facilitating access to knowledge and deepening dialogue around development challenges. The main objective of the Compendium: Coastal Management Practices in West Africa is to make knowledge on coastal management practices available to practitioners and decision-makers engaged in building coastal resilience in West Africa. At the same time, it informs any stakeholder concerned by risks related to coastal erosion and flooding. It complements technical catalogs on vulnerability to erosion, flood risks and flood protection infrastructure in West Africa.

AB  - Environmental compatibility of coastal protection plays an important role in today’s development and realization of new projects as well as in redesigning existing protection measures. In coastal protection strategies, natural structures like foreshore vegetation fields could be included as supportive element against wave forces and at the same time contributing to ecosystem quality and health. In this study, we present the development of a decision tree model to estimate wave attenuation by vegetation on the dike foreland. Our model is based on data from different published field measurements and laboratory experiments. In addition, a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model is used to extend our dataset beyond the observed parameter range. Overall, we can see a good agreement between observed wave attenuation rates and the predictions of our decision tree model. The model is supposed to be a robust tool for practical applications in coastal protection strategies, returning ranges of the attenuation capability as induced by vegetation fields.

AB  - Encompassing large and diverse territories with different ocean basins, the Asia-Pacific region is currently not on track to reach key targets, including those related to marine pollution, the conservation of coastal areas, and marine resources for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs). Regional and transboundary cooperation efforts and mechanisms are necessary for the delivery of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 and are of relevance in the socioeconomic response to COVID-19. Ocean ecosystems are in a constant struggle to moderate the impacts of land-based lifestyles, such as the consequences of climate change for marine habitats in the form of coral bleaching, acidification, eutrophication, ocean warming, rising sea levels, harmful algal blooms, and a long list of pressures. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing challenges, including environmental issues facing marine ecosystems. Although fisheries support the livelihoods of millions of people in Asia and the Pacific and provide a major component of the diets of communities across the region, fish stocks continue to decline, and consumption patterns are unsustainable. This situation is accompanied by additional stressors, such as climate change-induced migrations of species and harmful practices such as persistent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

AB  - Effective adaptation to sea-level rise is critical for future flood protection. Nature-based solutions including salt marshes have been proposed to naturally enhance coastal infrastructure. A gently sloping grass-covered dike (i.e. Wide Green Dike) can be strengthened with clay accumulating locally in the salt marsh. This study explores the feasibility of extracting salt-marsh sediment for dike reinforcement as a climate adaptation strategy in several sea-level rise scenarios, using the Wide Green Dike in the Dutch part of the Ems-Dollard estuary as a case study. A 0-D sedimentation model was combined with a wave propagation model, and probabilistic models for wave impact and wave overtopping. This model system was used to determine the area of borrow pits required to supply clay for adequate dikes under different sea-level rise scenarios. For medium to high sea-level rise scenarios (>102 cm by 2100) thickening of the clay layer on the dike is required to compensate for the larger waves resulting from insufficient marsh accretion. The model results indicate that for our case study roughly 9.4 ha of borrow pit is sufficient to supply clay for 1 km of dike reinforcement until 2100. The simulated borrow pits are refilled within 22 simulation years on average, and infilling is projected to accelerate with sea-level rise and pit depth. This study highlights the potential of salt marshes as an asset for adapting flood defences in the future.

AB  - Ecosystems provide multiple environmental, economic, and social benefits for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Working with nature has proven to be advantageous in many dimensions that international and national policy and actions have started to integrate ecosystem-based approaches to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. There are also increasing calls for significant investments in restoring and protecting natural capital utilizing ecosystem-based approaches at the country level. However, challenges remain, and progress is limited in applying ecosystem-based risk reduction in policy and practice in many regions and countries. This chapter reviews the key concepts in ecosystem-based risk reduction, describing synergies and differences, examines how the global agendas prioritize ecosystem-based risk reduction, surveys the research trends in ecosystem-based approaches, and studies how ecosystem-based risk reduction is implemented in practice including the standards and criteria developed. Barriers to further scale-up ecosystem-based risk reduction are identified as well as opportunities to advance ecosystem-based risk reduction. The chapter concludes by highlighting the gaps in research and practice and urging for focused efforts on building evidence and awareness of the benefits of ecosystem-based risk reduction to communities and societies.

AB  - Ecosystems play a potentially important role in sustainably reducing the risk of disaster events worldwide. Yet, to date, there are few comprehensive studies that summarize the state of knowledge of ecosystem services and functions for disaster risk reduction. This paper builds scientific evidence through a review of 529 English-language articles published between 2000 and 2019. It catalogues the extent of knowledge on, and confidence in, ecosystems in reducing disaster risk. The data demonstrate robust links and cost-effectiveness between certain ecosystems in reducing specific hazards, something that was revealed to be particularly true for the role of vegetation in the stabilization of steep slopes. However, the published research was limited in geographic distribution and scope, with a concentration on urban areas of the Global North, with insufficient relevant research on coastal, dryland and watershed areas, especially in the Global South. Many types of ecosystem can provide sustainable and multifunctional approaches to disaster risk reduction. Yet, if they are to play a greater role, more attention is needed to fill research gaps and develop performance standards.

AB  - Ecosystems across the globe are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as are the communities that depend on them. However, ecosystems can also protect people from climate change impacts. As the evidence base strengthens, nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly prominent in climate change policy, especially in developing nations. Yet intentions rarely translate into measurable, evidence-based targets. As Paris Agreement signatories revise their Nationally Determined Contributions, we argue that NbS are key to meeting global goals for climate and biodiversity, and we urge researchers to work more closely with policy-makers to identify targets that benefit both people and ecosystems.

AB  - Ecosystem-based protection is becoming a viable adaptation option to conventional engineered solutions to rising sea levels and coastal erosion. While the environmental and biological ecosystem services provided by ecosystem-based adaptation measures such as beach nourishment and/or seagrass plantations are being acknowledged and analysed, less attention has been paid to the social or cultural dimensions of these services. This paper builds upon the emerging body of research that explores cultural ecosystem services in coastal areas and how they are perceived by the people who live, work and recreate in these areas. The aim of the paper is to take stock of and understand public and stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services that may accrue through eelgrass Zostera marina restoration in tandem with beach nourishment in southern Sweden. The empirical research is based on an on-line open-ended questionnaire in the coastal municipalities of Båstad, Trelleborg, Ystad and Kristianstad. The results demonstrate that virtually all respondents had noticed a change in the coastline in recent years, mainly that the coastline had retreated. While beach nourishment measures were recognized among respondents to counter the shoreline erosion, there was very little understanding of the role that eelgrass plantations can play in creating biodiversity and benefits for society. Still, most acknowledged the importance of making room for water and biodiversity at the coast stating how the coastline was valued for primarily health and spiritual reasons. This knowledge will help local, regional and national decision-makers and regulatory authorities to make evidence-based choices for coastal protection, by complementing the analysis of environmental and physical ecosystem-services with cultural and socio-economic considerations. Nature-based solutions such as eelgrass reintroduction or beach nourishment should be tailored to the values, perspectives and perceptions of the local communities to help ensure their continued contribution to biodiversity.

We argue that reporting on GI under indicators D-4 and C-5 in the SFM represent an opportunity for tracking losses, yet do not provide direct information on progress made in reducing risk. Custom targets and indicators according to countries' needs within the SFM might be a more practical opportunity to report on both losses and progress.

AB  - Ecosystem-based approaches provide opportunities for climate policy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to expand the adaptive capacities and resilience of land systems to a changing climate, and to simultaneously protect biodiversity and ecosystems services (ESS). However, knowledge about the economic benefits and cost-efficiency of ecosystem-based approaches is still limited. The objective of this paper is to enhance understanding of synergies and trade-offs between climate policy related measures and nature conservation and how ecosystem-based approaches can contribute to both climate as well as biodiversity and ESS conservation goals, through overall economic analyses to inform balanced decision making. The paper builds upon the current state of knowledge as brought together by contributors to the German national TEEB-study “Natural Capital and Climate Policy – Synergies and Conflicts”. We present options and lessons learned from major land-use sectors of high relevance for ecosystem-based approaches to climate change, namely agriculture, peatlands, forests, wetlands and coastal and marine ecosystems. Based on these assessments, we argue that successful implementation of an ecosystem-based climate policy requires effective coordination and coherence between sectors and their respective policies, for example agriculture, forestry and energy. We identify specific targets for an ecosystem-based climate policy and options for achieving this coherent implementation.

AB  - Ecosystem-based adaptation (Eba) uses biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of a larger adaptation strategy to climate change. While the conservation and sustainable development community considers EbA to be a strong method of addressing climate change and its associated challenges, there is still a tendency for policy makers to implement traditional engineering solutions for adapation, rather than investing in EbA. The need for solid data on the cost-effectiveness of this nature-based approach was the driver behind an IUCN study identifying the economic costs and benefits associated with EbA. The study reviewed projects and assessed existing data from Costa Rica, India, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines and Tanzania. The results show that there are still extensive knowledge gaps, and that further cost-benefit analysis work and field evidence is required to showcase more clearly the nature-based solutions that EbA offers to climate change.

AB  - Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. EbA provides an approach to sustainable development that contributes simultaneously to socio-economic development, climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation. This is because EbA considers ways to manage ecosystems so that they can provide services that reduce vulnerability and increase the resilience of socio-ecological systems to both climatic and non-climatic risks, while at the same time providing multiple socio-economic benefits to society. Owing to the multiple benefits that EbA provides, it can be of use to coastal cities and the multi-faceted systems that exist within these cities. Like coastal cities around the world, South African coastal cities are highly vulnerable to climate impacts. Durban and Cape Town, among others, are increasingly exposed to climate impacts such as flooding, rising sea levels, seawater intrusion and coastal storm surges. These cities are key economic zones that are important contributors to the national economy, thus attracting large populations (including the urban poor) that reside in coastal urban and peri-urban areas. Therefore, climate impacts will affect not only urban economies but also the livelihoods and well-being of coastal populations. As EbA benefits both nature and people, it can be used to address socio-economic and development goals. However, various barriers and challenges exist in the implementation and governance of EbA in South African coastal cities. For South Africa to reap the benefits offered by EbA, it is crucial that the challenges associated with regulation, governance and management, institutional arrangements and partnerships, knowledge, communication and engagement, and financial mechanisms are addressed, and that the opportunities related to these areas are maximised. The outcomes of this paper provide learning opportunities for African and other developing coastal cities.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) are increasingly embedded in policy agendas, but if and how policy actors are considering them is not often reported. This study assesses the extent to which ES were considered by key policy actors involved in the strategic decision-making process leading to an innovative large-scale Dutch coastal management project. We analysed retrospective interviews to ascertain which ES were considered and how they were described by policy actors. Over half of the quotes (118/228) and 16 out of the 17 interviewees referred to three broad ES categories, with high degrees of adoption: coastal safety, recreation and cognitive development (learning by doing). The broad terms ‘nature’ and ‘spatial quality’ were also referenced often (36 times). Our findings suggest that broad, unspecified ecosystem services were adopted highly by the policy actors, while specific ecosystem service categories were rarely considered. Relatable and comprehensible cultural ecosystem services also constituted critical arguments for policy actors in their strategic decision making. We reflect that ambiguous, broad terms can help to garner support and unite efforts across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. For ES to align with relevant aspects of decision making, a ‘translation step’ between ES research and decision making might be required and ambiguity should be acknowledged.

AB  - Ecosystem based coastal management has gained in interest over the last decades. Development was achieved by incorporating different ecosystems services into coastal protection that can deal with threats related to climate change, such as accelerating sea level rise and increased storminess. The ecosystem-based approach not only tries to minimize anthropogenic impacts of coastal protection infrastructures on ecosystems but also aims at offering possibilities to enhance ecosystem functioning and resilience. Natural coastal ecosystems, such as biogenic reefs, dunes, beaches and tidal wetlands have potential value in protecting the coast from erosion and waves, with the benefit that these systems have some ability to self-repair and adapt in changing climate. The use of sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the beneﬁt of both is called ecological engineering. It attempts to combine engineering principles with ecological processes to reduce environmental impacts from built infrastructure. Certain key species inhabiting those coastal habitats are known as ecosystem engineers. A number of ecosystem engineers such as coral reefs, reef forming bivalves, vegetation of kelps and seagrasses, marshes and mangroves are known to play engineering roles in shallow estuarine and coastal areas. Reef forming bivalves that occur in coastal waters can attenuate erosive wave energies, stabilize sediments and reduce marsh retreat. Oysters are commonly said to be ecosystem engineers as they form structures that influence the environment around them in ways that are beneficial to other species. There is a positive feedback of oyster reefs on the settlement of new recruits which makes the reefs self-sustaining. They provide a variety of ecologically and economically valuable goods and services. Oyster reefs serve as natural coastal buffers, absorbing wave energy directed at shorelines and reducing erosion from boat wakes, sea level rise, and storms. Given adequate recruitment and survival, oyster reefs could be self-sustaining elements of coastal protection that enhance other habitats. More than fifty studies were conducted throughout the world since 1995 to evaluate the different ecosystem services provided by oyster reefs including coastal defence. Several studies showed that created oyster reefs can reduce the coastal erosion rate in comparison to control sites with no reefs. This PhD study utilized this concept of oysters as ecosystem engineers and studied the rock oyster, Saccostrea cucullata, in a subtropical, monsoon dominated environment in Bangladesh. This particular environment imposes dynamic conditions for oysters to grow and act as ecosystem engineers. This study investigated the critical factors that determine oyster (S. cucullata) growth and development in a dynamic, monsoon dominated coastal ecosystem of Bangladesh. This study performed experiments by using oyster breakwater reefs to evaluate their eco-engineering effect on: (1) erosion control; and (2) biodiversity of benthic macroinvertebrates and fishes. It was aimed that the application of oyster breakwater reefs can be beneficial to mitigate erosion of tidal flats, promote sediment accretion and facilitate habitats for increasing saltmarsh growth and faunal abundance. At first, the question was where oysters can settle and grow out, so the focus is on boundary conditions in terms of habitat quality (Chapter 2). To answer this, a habitat suitability index (HSI) model was developed to identify potential suitable sites around the south-eastern Bangladesh coast, where oysters can establish. Seven habitat factors were used as input variables for the HSI model: water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, particulate inorganic matter (PIM), pH, Chlorophyll-a, and water flow velocity. Comprehensive field surveys were conducted at 80 locations to collect geo-spatial environmental data, which were used to determine HSI scores using habitat suitability functions. The model results clearly showed that sites from the mouth of Sangu River to the tip of Teknaf, including the offshore islands (Kutubdia and Maheshkhali), are found suitable (HSI >0.50) habitats for oysters, except a few areas near small river mouths which become dynamic with freshwater flashes during monsoon months. These areas showed relative high salinity, Chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and pH. In contrast, freshwater dominated estuaries and nearby coastal areas (i.e. northern part of the study area coving Sandwip, Feni, Mirsarai, Chittagong) with high suspended sediment concentrations from river discharges were found less suitable (HSI <0.50) for oysters. Salinity, Chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and pH were identified as driving factors that determine the habitat quality for oyster in Bangladesh coast. The HSI model results match the current distribution of oysters throughout the investigated area. The good correspondence with the field data enhances the reliability of the presented HSI model as an interactive and quantitative tool for planning and managing oyster resources along the south-eastern coast of Bangladesh. Secondly, seasonal dynamics in oyster performances are analysed by measurements of the physiological performance of the oysters as a function of environmental conditions (Chapter 3 and 4). Chapter 3 provides physiological information of S. cucullata related to different ecological parameters, which were synthesized from large number of eco-physiological experiments and the outcomes were further used to estimate the DEB model parameters. It is concluded that the hydrometeorological aspects, i.e. a monsoon regime and high turbidity levels, are quite different from temperate regions and drives the physiological traits of shellfish organisms in Bangladesh coastal waters. The estimated DEB parameters for Saccostrea cucullata and their related univariate data provided opportunities (see chapter 4) to simulate the oyster growth in a monsoon dominated hydrodynamic environment. Chapter 4 utilizes the dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory, which allows to establish links between the physiology of an organism and its environment by capturing the metabolic dynamics of an individual organism through its entire life cycle. Developed DEB model was validated by simulating S. cucullata growth under varying hydro-biological conditions. The model results are compared with independent field observations on the growth (length and weight) of S. cucullata at three different sites (Sonadia, Kutubdia and Inani) located in the south-eastern coast of Bangladesh, covering a distinct environmental gradient. The sites vary spatially and temporally in environmental conditions such as salinity, total particulate matter (TPM) and Chlorophyll-a concentrations due to the monsoonal river discharges. At the three sites, field observations of oyster growth, temperature and food availability (Chlorophyll-a and Particulate Organic Matter-POM) have been carried out in the period between September 2014 - August 2017. The DEB model reproduced temporal as well as spatial variation in oyster growth as a function of the prevailing environmental conditions. Growth rates of oysters were highest (shell length: 3cm yr-1) in Sonadia Island due to better food conditions. Whereas, the growth rates were relatively low (1.94 cm yr-1) in Kutubdia and none of oysters survived in Inani during the monsoon event due to high suspended load (889 ± 101 mg l-1) and low Chlorophyll-a (1.86 ± 0.16 µg l-1) conditions. Temporal variation is largely monsoon driven: the period between November to May was the main growing season for oysters along the Bangladesh coast, while growth slowed down in the monsoon months (June-September). DEB model simulations for S. cucullata showed good fit (>8.54 score out of 10) with measured growth data under the different in situ conditions throughout the seasons. It means that the DEB model for S. cucullata demonstrated accuracy for simulating growth in its natural environment along the Bay of Bengal. Therefore, the model can be used to evaluate potential sites for oyster culture development or restorati n to enhance coastal resilience. Thirdly, in Chapters 5 and 6, it was tested if the application of oyster breakwater reefs contribute to reducing coastal erosion in the context of monsoon-dominated subtropical coast and at the same time be beneficial in facilitating other habitats (i.e. mudflat, saltmarsh) and species (macro-invertebrates, fishes). Therefore a suitable site was chosen based on model outputs and observations, namely an eroding mudflat on Kutubdia Island. Here, concrete rings with oysters overgrown for 2 years were placed as oyster breakwater reefs in the lower intertidal zone of the mudflat. The oyster breakwater reefs were tested to see whether it reduced sediment erosion, promoted mudflat stability and enhanced seaward salt marsh expansion and growth, in comparison with areas without such reefs. The results demonstrated that oyster breakwater reefs are particularly useful to reduce erosion at lower intertidal areas as the reefs successfully trapped sediments by dissipating waves. Oyster breakwater reefs modified the mudflat morphology up to 35 m distance at the lee side with accretion of 29 cm clayey sediments and erosion rate was two times lower during the monsoon period compared to control sites. By doing so, it enhanced the growth of new salt marsh vegetation and expanded their seaward edge effectively, thereby further stabilizing the unconsolidated sediments. Therefore, along the coast of Bangladesh, where oyster larval supply is abundant, the eco-engineered breakwater structures have the potential to contribute to a more sustainable shoreline protection against erosion. Chapter 6 aims to analyze the effects of these breakwater reefs on abundance and composition of macrobenthic soft-bottom assemblages together with transient and resident mobile fauna (fish, shrimp, crabs and other macro-invertebrates) in comparison with adjacent control sites without reefs. Seasonal influences were also considered to understand whether the effects of reefs depend on seasons. This study clearly indicates that oyster breakwater reefs had a positive effect on mudflat fauna communities. It shows higher abundances and biomass of fish and macroinvertebrates relative to the adjacent control sites. Seasonal variation was obvious, but didn’t overrule the reef impact. Multivariate analyses also demonstrated that the reef sites held distinct faunal communities, which differed from the control sites. Changes in macrobenthic community composition were associated with the variations in sediment load and characteristics, which were influenced by the breakwater reefs. Oyster breakwater reefs help to stabilize find sediments locally in lee side (landward) of the reefs, which is found as key reason to observe higher rates of macrobenthic colonization. Higher abundance of transient fish and mobile macro-invertebrates in reef sites indicated that breakwater oyster reefs attract mobile species as the reefs offer food and shelter. In fact, the study suggested that three-dimensional oyster breakwater reefs not only provide the shelter functions for mobile resident fauna, but also extend the ecosystem services related to nursing, breeding and foraging for numerous transient species by augmenting different prey resources for them. Though the ecological impact of oyster breakwater reefs was limited to a local area surrounding the reefs, this study provided hands-on evidence of ecological benefits using these reef configurations in estuarine and coastal habitats. This PhD study demonstrates that the use of the oyster breakwater reefs has multiple benefits. It can locally protect tidal flats against erosion and promote saltmarsh growth at the lee side of the reefs. These reefs act as breakwater and dissipate wave energy that accelerate the soft sediment deposition behind the structure and increase the bed level. This type of morphological changes may provide opportunities for mangrove planting. The study also showed that eco-engineered oyster reefs can support a high density of macro-benthos in reef areas, sessile macrofauna (oysters, barnac es, sea anemones etc.) on surface of reef substrates, large number of motile macro-invertebrates in reef system that attract transient nektons. The oyster breakwater reefs clearly has the potential to improve ﬁshery production by providing high quality habitat and prey to a variety of commercially and ecologically important ﬁshes, shrimps and crabs. Despite of having these benefits and opportunities, oyster breakwater reefs also have some limitations. Oysters need to settle, survive and grow at the designated place i.e. substrates in order to achieve long-term, persistent structures and self-sustainable reefs. This depends on the habitat characteristics of the site in the first place. Not all sites are equally suitable for oyster settlement survival and growth. Selection of the right site for creating oyster reefs is crucial. Therefore, we developed a HSI model that showed to be helpful in identifying potential sites (Chapter 2). The site can be further critically evaluated by a DEB model to understand seasonal dynamics in predicting oyster growth and reproduction (Chapter 4). Particularly, burial by sediment can cause significant loss of reef habitat. It can be avoided by increasing the heights of reef substrates based on the characteristics of the site. Additional constraints are the vulnerability of oysters for diseases and predation. Oyster drills (Urosalpinx spp.) and stone crabs (Myomenippe spp.) were found as meso-predators in the investigated sites, but their effects on oyster population need to be investigated. The intertidal rock oyster, S. cucullata can be ecologically engineered by providing hard substrates to settle on, that offers a kick-start for reef formation at places where they were lost or are desirable for coastal protection. Reef formation and development is however strongly dependent on the local environmental conditions governing oyster recruitment, survival and growth dynamics. These conditions can be highly dynamic, for example during the monsoon season. S. cucullata shows abilities to adapt to these conditions by regulating their physiological activities. The study shows that the S. cucullata populations are able to sustain in many estuarine areas along the southeast coast of Bangladesh as they can cope with the monsoonal climate. This makes them suitable for the role as eco-engineers for coastal protection. The study showed that artificial substrates can be used to develop self-sustaining oyster populations that contribute to coastal protection. Furthermore, oyster breakwater reefs dissipate the wave energy that reduces the hydrodynamic pressure on the foreshore of the primary dike and thus reduce the dike maintenance cost. Integration of oyster reefs with other ecosystems can add more benefits. Even it can enhance the possibility of doing oyster culture by enhancing larval supply in the area. Moreover, coexisting with other ecosystems viz., salt marsh and mangrove along with oyster breakwater reefs in the intertidal zone can act as bio-shield to prevent erosion and reduce the effect of cyclonic storm surges in the region. Therefore, oysters provide a great chance for Bangladesh to utilize them for the benefit of coastal people and environment.

AB  - Ecological restoration at large scales is required to recover damage to coastal and marine ecosystems nationally. Momentum is building within the Australian and international communities to support the implementation of restoration and NbS in coastal environments. However, several complex and interdependent challenges spanning environmental, technical, social, economic, and political realms preclude the widespread implementation and scaling up of ecological restoration in coastal and marine ecosystems globally, including Australia. Consequently, projects have typically been small scale, expensive, and subject to variable rates of success. These challenges, among others, are known to some degree by anyone working in the coastal restoration and NbS space. What is unknown at present is how to address these in a coordinated and meaningful way at a national scale. This project is designed to scope out multiple perspectives and to form the basis of a conversation around how to resolve these issues nationally. The project consisted of five aims: 1) Engage with end-user groups, including restoration researchers, practitioners and decision makers, to understand the current state, limitations, opportunities, and research needs for scaling up coastal restoration in Australia. This was conducted using a national-scale survey [Chapter 4] and focused workshops [Chapter 6]. 2) Conduct a targeted approach to Indigenous Engagement to understand the experiences and needs of Traditional Custodians [Chapter 5]; 3) Describe case studies of coastal and marine ecological restoration in Australia, including information on how barriers were overcome [Chapter 7]. 4) Explore data and models that are available across multiple spatial scales in the discipline of coastal engineering that could be used to inform decision science frameworks for NbS to coastal hazards [Chapter 8]. 5) Synthesize the findings into a strategic Roadmap which outlines the steps required to move from the current state of typically small, uncoordinated and often underfunded efforts to large scale and coordinated ecological restoration in coastal and marine systems [Chapter 9]. The findings of the report, which are synthesised in Chapter 9 as a Roadmap, are intended to form the basis of a conversation around transformational change in the implementation of coastal and marine restoration and NbS in Australia. Doing so will ultimately enable Australia to help meet national and international commitments which implicitly or explicitly include coastal and marine restoration, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Targets, the Paris Agreement, The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, and the Ramsar Convention. Following through on the Roadmap has the potential to elevate the state, condition and function of Australia’s coastal and marine assets, to substantively increase Australia’s capacity to adapt to climate change, and to increase the social, cultural and economic wellbeing of the Australian people. It would position Australia as a world leader with international standing in the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems, and implementation of coordinated, scaled restoration and Nature-based Solutions.

AB  - Eastern Africa’s coastal habitats host rich marine biodiversity with more than 6,000 documented species. Six major rivers flow into the Western Indian Ocean (WIO): the Tana and Athi-Sabaki Rivers in Kenya, the Rufiji and Ruvuma Rivers in Tanzania, and the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers in Mozambique. Their deltas are ideal nursery grounds and breeding areas for prawns, crabs, sea cucumber, snapper, emperor, grouper and several offshore commercially important tuna and mackerel. However, dams built upstream have reduced water flow and sediment and nutrient discharge to the coast. The resulting decline in productivity has had an adverse effect on fisheries.

AB  - Earthquake-triggered giant tsunamis can cause catastrophic disasters to coastal populations, ecosystems and infrastructure on scales over thousands of kilometres. In particular, the scale and tragedy of the 2004 Indian Ocean (about 230,000 fatalities) and 2011 Japan (22,000 fatalities) tsunamis prompted global action to mitigate the impacts of future disasters. In this Review, we summarize progress in understanding tsunami generation, propagation and monitoring, with a particular focus on developments in rapid early warning and long-term hazard assessment. Dense arrays of ocean-bottom pressure gauges in offshore regions provide real-time data of incoming tsunami wave heights, which, combined with advances in numerical and analogue modelling, have enabled the development of rapid tsunami forecasts for near-shore regions (within 3 minutes of an earthquake in Japan). Such early warning is essential to give local communities time to evacuate and save lives. However, long-term assessments and mitigation of tsunami risk from probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis are also needed so that comprehensive disaster prevention planning and structural tsunami countermeasures can be implemented by governments, authorities and local populations. Future work should focus on improving tsunami inundation, damage risk and evacuation modelling, and on reducing the uncertainties of probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis associated with the unpredictable nature of megathrust earthquake occurrence and rupture characteristics.

AB  - During the last decades many salt marshes worldwide have suffered important losses in their extent and associated ecosystem services. The salt marshes of San Vicente de la Barquera estuary (N Spain) are a clear example of this, with a drastic reduction in vegetation surface over the last 60 years. This paper provides insights into the main factors controlling salt marsh functioning in sheltered estuarine areas. Regional and local factors have been disaggregated to identify the main drivers controlling the functioning of the salt marsh to develop appropriate management measures according to the evolution of the system. These factors have been studied in their spatial context through detailed maps of change in vegetation cover combined with topographic data obtained from UAV and RTK-DGPS surveys. The results demonstrate that in this estuary the salt marsh area is declining following a fragmentation process. No clear pattern of vegetation loss/gain with elevation has been identified. However, the results point to increased hydrodynamic stress in the area, with stronger currents inside the estuary. This is probably the major factor responsible for the decline of the salt marshes in the San Vicente de la Barquera estuary. Furthermore, several human interventions during the 20th century (local drivers) have also probably contributed to a lower resilience against SLR (regional driver). This work demonstrates that both natural and human drivers of change need to be considered when characterizing the evolution of salt marshes, wherever efficient management strategies need to be designed.

AB  - Due to rising sea levels and projected socio-economic change, global coastal flood risk is expected to increase in the future. To reduce this increase in risk, one option is to reduce the probability or magnitude of the hazard through the implementation of structural, Nature-based or hybrid adaptation measures. Nature-based Solutions in coastal areas have the potential to reduce impacts of climate change and can provide a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to structural measures. In this paper, we present the first global scale assessment of the benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation as a means of adaptation to future projections of change in coastal flood risk. In doing so, we extend the current knowledge on the economic feasibility of implementing global scale Nature-based Solutions. We show that globally foreshore vegetation can contribute to a large decrease in both absolute and relative flood risk (13% of present-day and 8.5% of future conditions in 2080 of global flood risk). Although this study gives a first proxy of the flood risk reduction benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation at the global scale, it shows promising results for including Nature-based and hybrid adaptation measures in coastal adaptation schemes.

AB  - Disasters triggered by natural hazards such as floods, droughts or cyclones have the potential to cause large-scale damage on regional, national or even supranational scale. To cope with the impacts and to facilitate reconstruction the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) tool was developed. Its main goal is to assess damages and resulting early and long-term recovery needs and priorities. The assessment, a government-led exercise with support from the United Nations, the European Commission, the World Bank and others, is divided into different sectors, including environment, disaster risk reduction, and infrastructure as key topics. However, in reality the potential of this integrated approach is far from being fully exploited. The relevance of sound environmental conditions for recovery are under addressed in the other sector reports, such as the consideration of ecosystem-based approaches for disaster risk reduction and as part of green or hybrid infrastructures. Based on an in-depth assessment of past PDNA reports and a qualitative empirical survey among experts involved in these studies, this paper aims at assessing underlying reasons for the negligence of environmental aspects and potentials against other needs. After comparing the described environmental damages against proposed recovery strategies in the respective sector – if made at all – we highlight related potential shortcomings and challenges. In a second step, the proposed (engineered) risk reduction measures are analyzed regarding their consideration of ecosystem-based approaches. We conclude by proposing potentials to leverage environmental considerations and ecosystem-based solutions into risk reduction strategies.

AB  - Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation are connected through a common goal: reducing the impacts of extreme events and increasing resilience to disasters, particularly among vulnerable populations. By coordinating adaptation and disaster risk management policies, multiple benefits can be achieved. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) offers a cost-effective adaptation and DRR at different scales and under multiple scenarios. EbA uses natural or managed ecosystem processes to increase resilience and adaptation to climate change. EbA delivers other benefits, including mitigating greenhouse gases, and improving biodiversity, water and air quality. These co-benefits can be the primary driver for implementation and reflect related policy objectives. EbA are also associated with different land use or habitat types (e.g. agriculture, forestry, coastal, urban, or freshwater ecosystems). This paper considers the lessons learnt from implementing EbA across a range of land uses. However, implementation frequently applies multiple measures across land uses and at varying scales. The evidence indicates that adaptation and DRR are achievable cost-effectively whilst providing important co-benefits. Demonstrating these co-benefits ensures both stakeholder support and funding opportunities. Further, the mainstreaming of nature-based solutions across policy areas linked to different co-benefits both increases the acceptability of EbA and also opens up multiple funding sources. Key to the success of EbA is the involvement of stakeholders throughout the implementation process; this can include demonstrating private benefits and utilising trusted intermediaries. However, gaps often remain in our knowledge of the biophysical and economic benefits, or negative impacts, of EbA indicating that research and monitoring remain a priority.

AB  - Dikes are the conventional means of flood defence along rivers and estuaries. However, dikes gradually lead to the superelevation of waterbodies compared to the subsiding embanked areas, resulting in a rapidly increasing unstable situation under sea-level rise. Therefore, future flood management requires new, sustainable strategies that not only minimise flood risk, but also steer land-level rise. An example is a transitional polder, where a dike-protected area is temporarily reopened to the tide to capture sediment until it has risen well above mean sea-level, after which it could be returned to its original function. This study explores how the sequence of opening transitional polders affects sediment capture and large-scale estuary dynamics through 2D modelling in Delft3D. To this end, different opening sequences were tested along a large estuary, using the Western Scheldt (NL) as an example. Findings show land-level rise in all permutations. However, polders opened later in an opening sequence temporarily experience a lag in muddy sediment capture, most likely due to a deficit in fines. Opening more upstream located polders alone or at the start of an opening sequence generally causes a stronger reduction in mean tidal range than opening more downstream located polders. This is explained by increased friction due to (1) locally added intertidal width and (2) shallowing of the main channels because of increased flood dominance. An upstream-to-downstream opening sequence caused the greatest reduction in mean tidal range, but this is negligible compared to the increase in tidal range due to historic dredging within the estuary for navigational purposes. Further work is needed to determine how dredging, closure of transitional polders and storm surges may negate this benefit to flood safety.

AB  - Development in Indonesia has resulted in reduced poverty but has also been accompanied by significant pressure on natural capital, particularly its mangrove ecosystems, which are the most carbon-rich ecosystems on earth. Mindful of the negative impacts associated with coastal ecosystems degradation, the government of Indonesia has embarked on a blue economy strategy encompassing a range of initiatives, including tackling mangrove degradation and depletion. Recently, the government of Indonesia has set an ambitious target for mangrove restoration of 600,000 hectares by 2025. How this target can be reached and the implications of the actions to be taken are subject to national debate. The objective of this report is to inform sustainable mangrove management policies in Indonesia through quantification of the values and spatial variations of the net benefits of mangrove conservation and restoration. The report compares the costs and benefits of mangrove restoration and conservation using a nation-wide spatial cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The analysis is spatially explicit, meaning that variation in costs and benefits by location are assessed, helping to identify cost-effective locations for large-scale mangrove restoration and conservation. The results of this assessment should help the government, the private sector, and other stakeholders across Indonesia better understand the costs and benefits of mangrove management decisions.

AB  - Destructive business practices and an economic and financial system that prioritizes efficiency have in part been responsible for intense degradation of nature and the extinction of many species. Businesses depend on a healthy planet to provide a stable operating environment, customers and workforces, and the natural resources necessary for production – food, fibre, water, minerals, building materials and more. Losing nature means losing these services, creating extra costs and vulnerability for businesses. The impacts of nature loss are already becoming more than just financial projections and are showing up on business balance sheets. The Business for Nature coalition launched in July 2019 to champion radical collaboration to unite the vast network of business initiatives for nature, with the goal of demonstrating credible business leadership on nature and amplifying a powerful leading business voice calling for governments to adopt policies now to reverse nature loss in this decade.

AB  - Despite wide recognition of the multiple ecosystem services provided by mangroves, they continue to experience decline and degradation especially in the face of urbanization. Given the interplay between multiple resources and stakeholders in the fate of mangroves, mangrove management can be framed as a nexus challenge and nexus thinking used to identify potential solutions. Using the Klang Islands, Malaysia, as a case study site, this paper characterizes the mangrove nexus and stakeholders' visions for the future to identify potential options for future management. Through a series of stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions conducted over two years, results show that local communities can identify benefits from mangroves beyond the provisioning of goods and significant impacts to their lives from mangrove loss. While better protected and managed mangroves remained a central part of participants' visions for the islands, participants foresaw a limited future for fishing around the islands, preferring instead alternative livelihood opportunities such as eco-tourism. The network of influencers of the Klang Islands’ mangroves extends far beyond the local communities and many of these actors were part of the visions put forward. Stakeholders with a high interest in the mangroves typically have a low influence over their management and many high influence stakeholders (e.g. private sector actors) were missing from the engagement. Future nexus action should focus on integrating stakeholders and include deliberate and concerted engagement with high influence stakeholders while at the same time ensuring a platform for high interest/low influence groups. Fortifying existing plans to include mangroves more explicitly will also be essential. Lessons learnt from this study are highly relevant for coastal mangrove systems elsewhere in the Southeast Asian region.

AB  - Despite the terrifying recent fires in Australia, California and Brazil there are grounds for hope that the world could finally start valuing its forests. Many governments now say they love trees. There is an increasing international effort to slow rates of forest decline and restore forests where they once stood. Seventy-six world leaders have just signed the Leaders Pledge for Nature, committing to reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, including the restoration of a significant share of degraded ecosystems. As we approach the United Nations Summit on Biodiversity, this shows the international community may be willing to chart a new direction in environmental decision-making. It follows several other international restoration initiatives, such as the Bonn Challenge to restore 350 million hectares of lost and degraded habitat over the next 10 years and calls for mass planting such as the Trillion Tree Campaign. This new political discourse on the importance of trees is welcome. It reflects a growing understanding that forests are essential for our future. Two years ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published their Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. They described four scenarios that could lead the world to this best-case level of warming. All of them require both massive cuts in new carbon emissions and removal of carbon that is already in the atmosphere, which will have to continue long after 2050 when emissions approach net-zero. Many ecosystems, including tropical forests, peatlands and seagrass meadows, are efficient carbon sinks; mangrove forests are amongst the most powerful of these natural allies against climate change. The more these ecosystems can be preserved and expanded, the less reliance we will have on untested and (in some cases) yet-to-be-invented technologies for carbon removal. Carbon-rich ecosystems typically bring many co-benefits – with mangroves, these include coastal protection, production of food, other natural resources and medicines, and habitat for biodiversity. Short-term thinking often drives deforestation and so removing forests frequently makes no economic sense. The case for ‘nature-based solutions’ (enhancing natural ecosystems that trap and store carbon and provide many cobenefits) is overwhelming. We have made substantial progress in conserving the world’s mangrove forests; in some respects, this is a conservation success story. We are still losing them, but rates of loss have declined from 1-2% to around 0.13% per year over the past three decades. Many countries, including Sri Lanka and Indonesia, have made serious and high profile commitments to conserving what mangroves remain. Major international campaigns are raising the profile of mangrove conservation and channelling funds towards their conservation and expansion. However, mangrove experts express concerns about simplistic calls for mass planting, for four reasons: First, there is a danger that an emphasis on tree planting distracts from the priority, which is to conserve what we have. Old-growth natural forests are irreplaceable. For example, mangroves may contain more than a thousand tonnes of carbon per hectare, which has accumulated in their soils over millennia. Removing these forests will result in the rapid mass release of carbon. Planting new forests cannot compensate for such losses on a timescale relevant to the immediate climate emergency. Second, the recent history of mangrove planting and restoration is a sorry one. Studies from around the world have shown that most attempts at mass planting of mangroves fail. The reasons for failure are mixed. Poorly designed incentives combined with a lack of basic ecological knowledge often result in people planting in completely unsuitable sites – such as low tidal mudflats or sensitive seagrass meadows – which have never supported mangrove trees. Where attempts at restoration are made in areas of former forest, the reasons for tree destruction must first be addressed and mitigated before a new forest can survive. Third, even whe newly planted trees do survive and grow, the resulting forest may be very different from a natural one, lacking its diversity. Mass planting often focuses on only one or two species that are easy to plant and creates species-poor stands that cannot perform all the biological functions of a natural forest. Fourth, growing and planting mangroves can be very expensive and time-consuming. If planting is not necessary, then this diverts funds from other conservation activities and breeds cynicism.

AB  - Despite the climate change commitments made under the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, the world will continue to experience negative climate impacts. As such, pre-emptive adaptation planning is necessary to build and sustain countries’ social, economic and environmental resilience. For vulnerable coastal and island states, this can be done through the enhanced sustainable management, restoration and conservation of their marine and coastal ecosystems. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) – or ecosystem-based approaches to climate adaptation – is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. EbA involves governing and managing ecosystems to enhance their resilience to climatic shocks and stresses – maintaining and, where possible, improving the quality and quantity of ecosystem services they provide to society – and in so doing supporting human communities to adapt to current and future climate risks.

AB  - Despite its importance in supporting the global economy and to accommodate an ever-growing population at the coast, many of the coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, reefs, seagrass meadows, salt marshes and dunes had in the recent years an accentuated decrease in their coverage. The loss of coastal ecosystems, among other problems, leads to the loss of natural capacity for flood mitigation and coastal erosion. Since a considerable share of the coastal population is living in flood-prone areas, the loss of capacity of the ecosystems to mitigate the impacts of floods and coastal erosion can increase the vulnerability to natural hazards such as storm surges, hurricanes and typhoons. This is especially relevant in a context of increasing sea-level rise and intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, both increasing the risk to lose lives and assets. Coastal flood mitigation has been done primarily through the use of hard grey infrastructures. However, these types of structures can have long-term impacts on coastal ecosystems, require continuous maintenance and, in the face of extreme events, may represent an inefficient way to prevent coastal degradation. This called the attention of scientists and decision-makers towards the role of nature to mitigate the impacts of coastal floods through nature-based solutions (NBS). NBS, under the framework of ecosystem-based management, are interventions that aim to reduce the impacts of coastal flooding and erosion and simultaneously enhance ecosystems, biodiversity and natural resources. NBS can use (1) natural solutions (e.g. marine protected areas), (2) soft engineering and ecological restoration (e.g. beach nourishment) and (3) hybrid solutions, which integrate natural and grey infrastructures. Recently, NBS are gaining popularity and are part of coastal management strategies in many countries. Despite their efficiency, it is still a new practice, and therefore concerns are raised regarding their environmental and anthropogenic impacts. Also, there are some drawbacks and pitfalls that need to be overcome to increase NBS implementation. In this chapter we make an overview on the need for NBS for coastal flood mitigation, its implementation in a worldwide context, their impacts on the coastal social ecological economics systems, drawbacks and opportunities to improve their acceptance.

AB  - Despite an array of global interventions, climate change and biodiversity loss are remain pressing environmental problems. Developing countries, and in particular small island states (SIDS), are frequently more vulnerable to climate change than other nations. Furthermore, these nations rely heavily on biodiversity for sustenance, livelihoods and economies. Yet, financial and technical resources to address the challenges are often limited. Finding ways to effectively respond to both climate change and biodiversity loss is critical. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by exploring natured-based solutions to climate change and how these can simultaneously support marine and coastal biodiversity conservation. The particular lens through which this matter is explored is international law and specifically the commitments made in Nationally Determined Contribution documents (NDCs) submitted under the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Dense grass covers are generally recommended for surface protection of sea dikes against mild and moderate hydraulic loads. The standard seeding mixtures were composed to meet the technical requirements and ensure dike safety. These mixtures are, however, limited in their species diversity. In the present study, four differently vegetated surfaces were tested regarding their erosion resistance against wave impacts and overflow. The test vegetations ranged from a species-poor grass-dominated reference mixture to species-rich herb-dominated mixtures. Two vegetations were reinforced with a three-dimensional geogrid. For the unreinforced vegetations, the erosion rate due to wave impacts decreased exponentially with increasing root density and root length density. The geogrid reinforcements functioned as additional protection when the upper vegetation layer was eroded and led to slightly decreasing erosion rate with depth. In overflow simulations, the relatively densely-vegetated grass-dominated mixture experienced least erosion. Erosion was mainly initiated at bare spots emphasizing the major role of a closed vegetation cover and dike maintenance. The present results give new insights into erosion patterns of unreinforced and reinforced vegetated dike covers and the relation between vegetation parameters and hydraulic resistance to wave impacts and overflow.

Management strategies to restore or enhance sedimentation on delta plains, Sedimentation-Enhancing Strategies (hereafter SES), are now being pursued in many deltas but there has been limited cross-disciplinary and cross-delta review. Here we compare 21 existing and planned SES, synthesizing their physical characteristics, funding, governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement, process of implementation, environmental impact, land use change, and potential for upscaling. Strategies exist at various scales, from ~0.05 km2 - 500 km2. 79% of strategies are capable of outpacing high rates of sea-level rise. Cheaper strategies are limited to short term impacts and small spatial scales, while more expensive strategies can have longer lifetimes. Most strategies create wetlands and flood water storage. Some create opportunities for agriculture, aquaculture, housing, or recreational land use. Combinations of SES will likely be the most effective and sustainable method for maintaining elevation in river deltas.

AB  - Declines in wild oyster populations and the growing need to protect coastal communities have led to the creation of novel reef substrates for use in oyster reef restoration. However, innovations in alternative substrates have outpaced scientific research quantifying their efficacy, leaving managers without the information needed for widespread adoption. To assess the effects of Oyster Castles, a concrete-based oyster restoration structure, on rates of horizontal and vertical shoreline erosion and sediment composition, we constructed replicate reefs just offshore of a medium-energy eroding salt marsh shoreline in North Carolina. We monitored vertical accretion of sediments and sediment composition behind reefs versus control shorelines and also measured rates of horizontal shoreline change over a two-year period. Our results show that reef and control sites did not differ significantly in terms of vertical sediment accretion, horizontal shoreline change, or sediment composition. The lack of differences between our reef and control sites may be due to our reef design choices or to the short study period. To fill the data-gap marine managers face when choosing reef designs, we recommend monitoring restoration sites over longer timeframes (> 5 years) and assessing efficacy differences between reef designs and spatial scales.

AB  - Damaging storm events frequently impact the Texas coast. In response, the US Army Corps of Engineers Galveston District (SWG) has undertaken the Sabine-to-Galveston (S2G) Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) Project. This approximately $3.9B project includes numerous measures across several counties of the upper Texas coast, including levees, floodwalls, and pump stations. In June 2019, SWG leadership enlisted a team including the paper authors to integrate Engineering With Nature (EWN) strategies into this infrastructure project. EWN strategies intentionally align natural and engineering processes to efficiently and sustainably deliver economic, environmental, and social benefits through collaboration. The first step in this process was to develop potentially relevant EWN strategies. A collaborative workshop included visits to project sites and working sessions where the project team reviewed challenges associated with each site, generated an array of EWN strategies, and began to test design concepts based on those strategies through collaborative drawing sessions. Afterward, prioritized ideas were refined and evaluated in terms of property acquisition, estimated cost, logistics, stakeholder and sponsor interest, constructability, aesthetics, recreational opportunities, and ecological benefit. Design concepts considered feasible for integration into the broader S2G project included horizontal levees, inland floodwater storage areas that double as wildlife habitat, and strategic placement of sediment berms to reduce storm impacts and provide marsh substrate. All these concepts should achieve intended CSRM outcomes while enhancing environmental and social benefits. This assimilation of EWN strategies and landscape architecture techniques into a large CSRM study illustrates a method for expanding overall project value and producing infrastructure that benefits coastal communities.

AB  - Current climate crisis is associated with rising sea level and increasing frequency and strength of storm surges. This raises the concern of losing coastal ecosystems such as dunes and salt marshes. This thesis helps to understand the biogeomorphic processes in these coastal ecosystems. The morphological plasticity of dune pioneer species in response to physical disturbance was shown experimentally. This plasticity enables species to survive in dynamic ecosystems with changing abiotic conditions. Further, A. arenaria was shown to be a key species in coastal dunes as it was the main driver for the resistance and resilience of experimental dunes. Lastly, in a study along the North Sea coast it was shown that functional traits can effect surface elevation change in salt marshes. Thus, this thesis demonstrates the importance of functionally described vegetation in coastal dunes and salt marshes.

AB  - Coral reefs provide numerous ecosystem goods and services, but are threatened by multiple environmental and anthropogenic stressors. To identify management scenarios that will reverse or mitigate ecosystem degradation, managers can benefit from tools that can quantify projected changes in ecosystem services due to alternative management options. We used a spatially-explicit biophysical ecosystem model to evaluate socio-ecological trade-offs of land-based vs. marine-based management scenarios, and local-scale vs. global-scale stressors and their cumulative impacts. To increase the relevance of understanding ecological change for the public and decision-makers, we used four ecological production functions to translate the model outputs into the ecosystem services: \"State of the Reef,\" \"Trophic Integrity,\" \"Fisheries Production,\" and \"Fisheries Landings.\" For a case study of Maui Nui, Hawai'i, land-based management attenuated coral cover decline whereas fisheries management promoted higher total fish biomass. Placement of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) across 30% of coral reef areas led to a reversal of the historical decline in predatory fish biomass, although this outcome depended on the spatial arrangement of MPAs. Coral cover declined less severely under strict sediment mitigation scenarios. However, the benefits of these local management scenarios were largely lost when accounting for climate-related impacts. Climate-related stressors indirectly increased herbivore biomass due to the shift from corals to algae and, hence, greater food availability. The two ecosystem services related to fish biomass increased under climate-related stressors but \"Trophic Integrity\" of the reef declined, indicating a less resilient reef. \"State of the Reef\" improved most and \"Trophic Integrity\" declined least under an optimistic global warming scenario and strict local management. This work provides insight into the relative influence of land-based vs. marine-based management and local vs. global stressors as drivers of changes in ecosystem dynamics while quantifying the tradeoffs between conservation- and extraction-oriented ecosystem services.

AB  - Coral reefs in the tropical Pacific region are exposed to a range of anthropogenic local pressures. Climate change is exacerbating local impacts, causing unprecedented declines in coral reef habitats and bringing negative socio-economic consequences to Pacific communities who depend heavily on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions will drive future climate change, which will accelerate coral reef degradation. Traditional systems of resource governance in Pacific island nations provide a foundation to address local pressures and build reef resilience to climate change. Management and adaptation options should build on the regional diversity of governance systems and traditional knowledge to support community-based initiatives and cross-sectoral cooperation to address local pressures and minimize climate change impacts. Such an inclusive approach will offer enhanced opportunities to develop and implement transformative adaptation solutions, particularly in remote and regional areas where centralized management does not extend.

AB  - Coral reefs function as submerged breakwaters providing wave mitigation and flood-reduction benefits for coastal communities. Although the wave-reducing capacity of reefs has been associated with wave breaking and friction, studies quantifying the relative contribution by corals are lacking. To fill this gap, a series of experiments was conducted on a trapezoidal artificial reef model with and without fragments of staghorn coral skeletons attached. The experiments were performed at the University of Miami’s Surge-Structure-Atmosphere-Interaction (SUSTAIN) Facility, a large-scale wind/wave tank, where the influence of coral skeletons on wave reduction under different wave and depth conditions was quantified through water level and wave measurements before and after the reef model. Coral skeletons reduce wave transmission and increase wave-energy dissipation, with the amount depending on the hydrodynamic conditions and relative geometrical characteristics of the reef. The trapezoidal artificial coral reef model was found to reduce up to 98% of the wave energy with the coral contribution estimated to be up to 56% of the total wave-energy dissipation. Depending on the conditions, coral skeletons can thus enhance significantly, through friction, the wave-reducing capability of a reef.

AB  - Coral reefs are increasingly recognized for their shoreline protection services. The hydrodynamic performance of this ecosystem is comparable to artificial low-crested structures often used in coastal protection, whose objective is to emulate the former. Coral reefs also provide other important environmental services (e.g. food production, habitat provision, maintenance of biodiversity and social and cultural services) and leave almost no ecological footprint when conservation and restoration actions are conducted to maintain their coastal protection service. However, studies have focused on their flood protection service, but few have evaluated the morphological effects of coral reefs through their ability to avoid or mitigate coastal erosion. In this paper, we investigate the relation between shoreline change, reefs’ geometry and hydrodynamic parameters to elucidate the physics related to how the Mesoamerican Reef in Mexico protects sandy coastlines from erosion. Using numerical wave propagation and historical shoreline change calculated from satellite imagery, a direct correlation was found between shoreline movement, the depths and widths of reef flats, changes in the wave energy flux, and the radiation stresses of breaking waves. The findings indicate that the most remarkable efficacy in preventing beach erosion is due to reefs with shallow crests, wide reef flats, a dissipative lagoon seabed, located at ~300 m from the coastline. The results provide essential insights for reef restoration projects focused on erosion mitigation and designing artificial reefs in microtidal sandy beaches. Results are limited to wave-dominated coasts.

AB  - Coral reefs are exceptional natural ecosystems. Not only do they provide direct and indirect employment for local communities, but they are key structures in local ecosystems, creating beaches and providing an important level of coastal protection against severe hurricanes and storms. The protection of reefs is of crucial importance for many coastal communities. In this article, the coral reef insurance mechanism that financially protects the coastal areas in the State of Quintana Roo, Mexico, is discussed. The authors explore why coral reefs are threatened and which ecosystem services they provide to humans, a crucial step in providing insurance coverage. Further, the authors show how technology has made insuring coral reefs a viable business proposition. Insurance can support conservation funding while it is a form of financial disaster risk management. Finally, the authors illuminate that the conditions bringing public and private sector actors together like in the case of Quintana Roo, Mexico, are not easily replicable; and more research and understanding will be needed to provide extensive coral reef coverage. Insurance manages residual disaster risk, but it is not a replacement for physical disaster risk management measures.

AB  - Coral reefs are effective natural coastal flood barriers that protect adjacent communities. Coral degradation compromises the coastal protection value of reefs while also reducing their other ecosystem services, making them a target for restoration. Here we provide a physics-based evaluation of how coral restoration can reduce coastal flooding for various types of reefs. Wave-driven flooding reduction is greatest for broader, shallower restorations on the upper fore reef and between the middle of the reef flat and the shoreline than for deeper locations on the fore reef or at the reef crest. These results indicate that to increase the coastal hazard risk reduction potential of reef restoration, more physically robust species of coral need to be outplanted to shallower, more energetic locations than more fragile, faster-growing species primarily being grown in coral nurseries. The optimization and quantification of coral reef restoration efforts to reduce coastal flooding may open hazard risk reduction funding for conservation purposes.

AB  - Coral reefs are diverse ecosystems that support millions of people worldwide by providing coastal protection from waves. Climate change and human impacts are leading to degraded coral reefs and to rising sea levels, posing concerns for the protection of tropical coastal regions in the near future. We use a wave dissipation model calibrated with empirical wave data to calculate the future increase of back-reef wave height. We show that, in the near future, the structural complexity of coral reefs is more important than sea-level rise in determining the coastal protection provided by coral reefs from average waves. We also show that a significant increase in average wave heights could occur at present sea level if there is sustained degradation of benthic structural complexity. Our results highlight that maintaining the structural complexity of coral reefs is key to ensure coastal protection on tropical coastlines in the future.

AB  - Coral reefs are an important tourism resource for many coastal and island destinations and generate a range of benefits to their local communities, including as a food source, income from tourism, employment and recreational opportunities. However, coral reefs are under increasing threat from climate change and related impacts such as coral bleaching and ocean acidification. Other anthropogenic stresses include over-fishing, anchor damage, coastal development, agricultural run-off, sedimentation and coral mining. This book adopts a multidisciplinary approach to review these issues as they relate to the sustainable management of coral reef tourism destinations. It incorporates coral reef science, management, conservation and tourism perspectives and takes a global perspective of coral reef tourism issues covering many of the world’s most significant coral reef destinations. These include the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef in Australia, the Red Sea, Pacific Islands, South East Asia, the Maldives, the Caribbean islands, Florida Keys and Brazil. Specific issues addressed include climate change, pollution threats, fishing, island tourism, scuba diving, marine wildlife, governance, sustainability, conservation and community resilience. The book also issues a call for more thoughtful development of coral reef experiences where the ecological needs of coral reefs are placed ahead of the economic desires of the tourism industry.

AB  - Coral reefs are among the most fragile ecosystems that provide essential services to local Small Island Developing States (SIDS) communities. As such, exploring the characteristics and interactions shaping regime shifts of coral reefs is of paramount importance in managing system pressures; enhancing resilience; aiding their regeneration and recovery process; and restoring habitat complexity. However, understanding the dynamics of coral reef ecosystems regime shift requires employing an approach capable of dealing with systems being affected by multiple climatic and socio-economic non-climatic pressures as well as an effective treatment of systemic embedded uncertainties. This study applies Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) in a participatory stepwise and systematic procedure to reflect dynamic casualties and temporal changes of coral reef ecosystem regime change over a long-time perspective. This mapping technique allows conceptualising dynamic models to represent causalities and modelling input values to simulate fluctuations within a complex temporal system. Port Resolution on Tanna Island in Vanuatu was selected as the case study region representative of Pacific-SIDS geography and human communities. As an initial outcome and an indicator of multidisciplinary of this study, twenty-seven principal influential factors and their corresponding causal relationships were identified. Subsequently, the coral reef regime shift was analysed under four main plausible scenarios representing major climatic and non-climatic trajectories. The results indicate that climate change factors play pivotal roles in the regime shift of the coral reef ecosystem globally. At the focal scale of this study, the tourism industry and coral fisheries are the most vulnerable services provided by coral reefs. As such, coupled local management interventions and global efforts in mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change is likely to yield better coral reef ecosystem services at a local community level.

AB  - Coral reef ecosystems provide a broad spectrum of essential ecological, economic and cultural services for Small Island Developing State (SIDS) communities. However, coral reef communities are increasingly threatened by the adverse impacts of human activities at both global and local scales. This study aims to develop an integrated dynamic assessment framework to evaluate coral reef conditions under different adaptation and climate change scenarios, and their consequential economic impacts in the small island community of Port Resolution on Tanna Island in Vanuatu. Our assessment framework follows a sequential multilayered modelling approach that uses System Dynamics (SD) coupled with Bayesian Network (BN) modelling to deal with the complexity and dynamicity of socioeconomic and environmental systems, and impacts from trans-discipline variables. The BN incorporated existing data and expert knowledge to project the future conditions of coral reefs under different scenario settings, and to parametrise and quantify the SD model where the existing data and information was insufficient. The SD was then used to simulate the dynamic relationship between coral reef condition and the economic benefits derived from its ecosystem services under different climate change (i.e. RCPs) and management scenarios through to 2070. Our findings show that sustainable community-based conservation management strategies are key to preserving the flow of coral reef ecosystem services under RCP 2.6 and 6.0. Importantly, we demonstrate that the implementation of an integrated portfolio of management strategies better protects ecosystem services provided by coral reefs and maximises the total economic benefits achieved over the long-term despite a temporary and short-term economic loss due to high initial capital investments and income reduction due to fishing and tourism restrictions.

AB  - Constructed salt marshes as a Nature-Based Solution for coastal defense offer additional benefits over conventional engineering, but project realization is often hampered by practical and governmental obstacles. We assessed the execution of a local-scale salt marsh construction project as a Nature-Based Solution (NBS) with respect to the regional-scale Social-Ecological System (SES) in an explicitly linked NBS-SES framework. A local municipality came up with various plans to develop its waterfront but these proved unrealizable without wider stakeholder participation. Crucial for success was that the local initiative was turned into an NBS integrating livability, biodiversity and flood safety, and that it was linked to the governance systems and actors in a regional SES. The chosen NBS consists of a city beach and two salt marshes, a salt marsh park that is open to the public and a pioneer salt marsh that is only accessible for research. The pioneer salt marsh was constructed by raising the seabed to around mean high tide with sand obtained from a capital dredging project. It was used as a large-scale natural experiment in salt marsh construction. To test the effect of enrichment with silt and clay on initial salt marsh development, six hectare-scale compartments were created in which mud was mixed with sand in the top 1.0 m of the bed to three mud contents of on average 8%, 25% and 48%. Heavy machinery was needed to mix mud through the upper meter of the sandy bed. Mixing mud was softening the sediment causing the machines to sink into the 48% mud enriched bed. To test whether seeding with a pioneer plant species accelerates salt marsh development, fragments of Salicornia procumbens plants were seeded in half of three compartments. Field observations between November 2018 to September 2020 showed that seeding of Salicornia plant fragments resulted in significant differences in vegetation cover and species richness in the first growing season. Mud content showed significant positive effects on vegetation cover and species richness in the two monitored growing seasons, where the compartments with on average 7–9% mud had the lowest vegetation cover and species numbers. When constructing a salt marsh by raising sand and mixing mud, a mud content of 25% is practically feasible and results in high vegetation cover and species richness.

AB  - Considering the visibility of infrastructural projects as a means of coastal protection against urban sea level change, this paper draws attention to dyking as both a form of ‘defense’ and as a means of ‘dwelling’ or living with/from water. By tracing the emergence of a recent donor-funded polder dyke in Metro Manila (Philippines), the paper focuses on the infrastructural politics of coastal protection in a delta megacity, often technocratically framed as a global disaster capital. It illustrates how, as a socio-technological object, a dyke might serve as a distinct mode of governing everyday life along high density urban coastlines. Combining insights from Evolutionary Governance Theory (EGT) and infrastructural anthropology, the paper traces the materialization of the dyke as an evolving ‘living’ infrastructure, placing it against a broader canvas of urban transformations encompassing contestations around disaster risk reduction, land use, uneven livelihood access, tenurial rights, and neoliberal aesthetics. As a means of transcending the defense/dwelling binary, a typology of four interrelated frames are presented with which to trace localised meanings and practices of dyking as a mode of everyday governance, namely as: a) a line of defence for protective living; b) urban spectacle; c) a buffer zone or marker for land acquisition and; d) a fluid borderland, which at times ruptures the very material fixities and aqua-terrestrial distinctions upon which hard engineering infrastructural solutions are often premised.

AB  - Compared to traditional hard engineering, nature-based flood protection can be more cost effective, use up less raw materials, increase system adaptability and present opportunities to improve ecosystem functioning. However, high flood safety standards cause the need to combine nature-based structures with traditional civil engineered structures. This increases complexity assessing when and how ecological and engineering objectives of such flood protection systems are achieved. This study classifies the degree to which coastal designs are nature based using criteria for ecosystem-based management (EBM). For the engineering criterion the distinction between main and supporting structures is introduced. To evaluate the ecological criterion five design concepts have been introduced, ranging from completely engineered to completely nature-based. The method results in an EBM-ranking of the coast, showing where a particular flood protection design stands on the range between completely engineered (low EBM-rank) and nature-based (high EBM-rank). It thus facilitates comparison of different flood protection systems. The method was the applied on the North-Sea coast of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. The results show that combinations of civil-engineered and nature-based structures are widely applied. However, due to the overall low contribution to flood protection by the nature-based structures, about 85% of the coast is dominated by engineered structures. The majority of these stretches is located in relatively sheltered areas. Improving the flood protection capacity of the nature based structures in these areas is hard to achieve. Therefore, application of more nature-based design concepts on the main structures is the most promising way to improve the EBM-rank of many flood protection systems.

AB  - Communities located in the coastal zone are increasingly vulnerable to climate change. The effects of climate change may push coastal ecosystems to undergo irreversible changes. This is especially true for shorebirds as it results in the loss of biodiversity and resource-rich areas to rest, refuel and breed. To protect these species, it is critical to conduct more research related to nature-based solutions. Through a scoping review of scientific literature, this paper evaluated 85 articles and included a summary of various sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, including living shorelines and beach nourishment. These strategies were evaluated under the eight core principles of nature-based solutions in order to determine the efficiency of protecting shorebird biodiversity in the Greater Niagara Region. All adaptation strategies were examined through a social, economic and environmental lens and future improvements were suggested to increase the efficiency of these strategies. This research also highlights its contribution to sustainability science.

AB  - Communities in Northern Java, Indonesia are suffering from coastal erosion affecting hundreds of kilometres of coastline. At the north coast of the province of Central Java in the district of Demak more than 3 kilometres of land including entire villages has already been swallowed up by the sea. The main causes of the problem are the removal of mangrove belts for aquaculture development, the construction of coastal infrastructure impacting sediment build-up from offshore sources, river canalisation and land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction. The Building with Nature (BwN) approach was introduced in Demak to address these root causes and mitigate their effects. The approach integrates mangrove and river restoration, small-scale engineering and sustainable land use. Permeable brushwood and bamboo structures have been built to dampen the waves and capture sediment. Once the near shore bed level had risen enough, mangrove seedlings will start to regenerate naturally. Local communities build and maintain these permeable structures through a Bio-rights approach. They are also trained to practice sustainable mixed mangrove-aquaculture, working with probiotics and local food sources. A strategy of learning-by-doing was adopted, where sharing the knowledge and the lessons learnt is supporting sound replication of the BwN approach through capacity building, knowledge exchange and embedding in policies and planning. A lesson learnt is that the land subsidence is more severe than expected which affects the net sedimentation rate behind the permeable structures and slows down the recolonization by mangroves. This lesson is communicated to the communities and policy makers.

AB  - Communities around the world are increasingly interested in nature-based solutions to mitigation of coastal risks like coastal forests, but it remains unclear how much protective benefits vegetation provides, particularly in the limit of highly energetic flows after tsunami impact. The current study, using a three-dimensional incompressible computational fluid dynamics model with a fluid-structure interaction approach, aims to quantify how energy reflection and dissipation vary with different degrees of rigidity and vegetation density of a coastal forest. We represent tree trunks as cylinders and use the elastic modulus of hardwood trees such as pine or oak to characterize the rigidity of these cylinders. The numerical results show that energy reflection increases with rigidity only for a single cylinder. In the presence of multiple cylinders, the difference in energy reflection created by varying rigidity diminishes as the number of cylinders increases. Instead of rigidity, we find that the blockage area created by the presence of multiple tree trunks dominates energy reflection. As tree trunks are deformed by the hydrodynamic forces, they alter the flow field around them, causing turbulent kinetic energy generation in the wake region. As a consequence, trees dissipate flow energy, highlighting coastal forests reducing the onshore energy flux of tsunamis by means of both reflection and dissipation.

AB  - Coasts are dynamic places operated on by powerful natural and human forces. They are also historically attractive places for human settlement and use, with a still constantly growing concentration of people due to increased population growth and migration toward the coast. Coastal societies historically have evolved and developed culturally embedded relationships with their environment, which have resulted in different cultural settings, influencing the way they experience and react toward climate change impacts in their lifeworld. Coastal risks are specific to different regional, natural, and societal settings and can be distinguished between slow-onset (e.g., sea level rise or ocean acidification) and sudden extreme events (e.g., tropical cyclones or storm surges). Coastal climate risks come from flooding, storms, storm surges, saltwater intrusion, invasive species, declining fish stocks or shifting species’ regimes, coral bleaching, coastal erosion, and morphological change. For centuries, coastal societies have learned to defend the coast against threats from the sea with a broad range of technical measures based on a long history of trial and error, with successes and failures. Further, for centuries, littoral societies have constructed coasts and infrastructure according to their interests and needs (e.g., engineering the coastline, installing coastal defenses, constructing harbor and landing infrastructures, and even claiming land from the sea). Risks at the coast have always been there—but are exacerbated by climate change. A more integrated and transdisciplinary approach to understanding coastal climate risks is required, in keeping with the characterization of climate change as a wicked problem.

AB  - Coasts and Estuaries: The Future provides valuable information on how we can protect and maintain natural ecological structures while also allowing estuaries to deliver services that produce societal goods and benefits. These issues are addressed through chapters detailing case studies from estuaries and coastal waters worldwide, presenting a full range of natural variability and human pressures. Following this, a series of chapters written by scientific leaders worldwide synthesizes the problems and offers solutions for specific issues graded within the framework of the socio-economic-environmental mosaic. These include fisheries, climate change, coastal megacities, evolving human-nature interactions, remediation measures, and integrated coastal management. The problems faced by half of the world living near coasts are truly a worldwide challenge as well as an opportunity for scientists to study commonalities and differences and provide solutions. This book is centered around the proposed DAPSI(W)R(M) framework, where drivers of basic human needs requires activities that each produce pressures. The pressures are mechanisms of state change on the natural system and Impacts on societal welfare (including well-being). These problems then require responses, which are the solutions relating to governance, socio-economic and cultural measures (Scharin et al 2016).

AB  - Coastlines have traditionally been engineered to maintain structural stability and to protect property from storm-related damage, but their ability to endure will be challenged over the next century. The use of vegetation to reduce erosion on ocean-facing mainland and barrier island shorelines – including the sand dunes and beaches on these islands – could be part of a more flexible strategy. Although there is growing enthusiasm for using vegetation for this purpose, empirical data supporting this approach are lacking. Here, we identify the potential roles of vegetation in coastal protection, including the capture of sediment, ecological succession, and the building of islands, dunes, and beaches; the development of wave-resistant soils by increasing effective grain size and sedimentary cohesion; the ability of aboveground architecture to attenuate waves and impede through-flow; the capability of roots to bind sediments subjected to wave action; and the alteration of coastline resiliency by plant structures and genetic traits. We conclude that ecological and engineering practices must be combined in order to develop a sustainable, realistic, and integrated coastal protection strategy.

AB  - Coastlines are subject to impacts of waves and currents, which drive risks of shoreline erosion and flooding of adjacent low-lying land. Increased risks are expected due to sea level rise, increasing storm intensity and frequency, land subsidence, and population growth. In this context, growing interest in how coastal ecosystems attenuate energy from waves and currents has motivated the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) for coastal protection. Although modeling and observations are already informing NBS, new predictive tools and methodologies are still needed to estimate the level of protection they provide under varied environmental and ecosystem conditions, to guide implementation of NBS as integrated parts of coastal protection practices. A first step to ensure proper implementation of NBS, is to better understand and parameterize the main processes involved in flow-ecosystem interactions. To this end, field and laboratory studies have been carried out to quantify the degree to which ecosystem properties induce hydrodynamic energy attenuation. In addition, numerical models, validated by field and laboratory data, provide tools to estimate such attenuation capacity. However, challenges remain in directly applying these findings in coastal protection practice. Specifically, a deeper understanding of how energy attenuation varies with local flow conditions and ecosystem properties remains crucial to facilitate the prioritization of NBS for coastal adaptation.

AB  - Coastal zones are one of the most dynamic natural ecosystems of our planet. The survival and livelihoods of coastal communities are contingent on the ecosystem services that coastal zones provide. Primary among these services is the reduction of coastal risks through the attenuation/ dissipation of wave energy, breaking of offshore waves, slowing of inland water transfer and sediment stabilization. These functions protect people and infrastructure from coastal risks like tsunamis, storm surges, high wind and wave velocity, and other such extreme events. There is increasing evidence that coastal ecosystems including marshes, mangroves, near-shore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sandy beaches and dunes provide the critical service of coastal risk reduction. Coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts brought on by climate change such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion due to relative sea-level rise. Changes in storm intensity, high wind and wave velocity and storm surges may further contribute to an increase in the hazards faced by coastal communities. My analysis showed that the threats faced by the states on the eastern coast of India are very high and the coping capacity of these states is low. This would exacerbate the impact of extreme events, brought on by climate change, in these states. Further, geospatial analysis shows that natural coastal ecosystems have declined over the last two decades and urbanization has occurred at a very fast pace, at the expense of these natural ecosystems. Coastal population has also increased, further increasing the exposure to coastal risks. Using DPSIR as a framework, I analyzed two polices relevant to coastal risk reduction and climate change, the National Action Plan on Climate Change (2008) and the Coastal Regulation Zone (2019). My analysis showed that these policies do not sufficiently identify and address the climate drivers and the pressures that coastal ecosystems face. They also do not fully identify the state of the ecosystem or address the pressures. The response needs augmenting as zoning allows for too many exemptions and permissions, identification and mapping of important areas of concern have not been completely carried out, and clear goals have not been set. The measures do not adequately address threats and do not contain objective criteria for assessment. Further, outcome indicators have also not been defined. While data illustrates the fact that coastal risks have increased due to urbanization and loss of natural cover, sufficient measures have not been put in place to address these. Based on the shortcomings and lacunae in the capacity of the analyzed policies to address threats to coastal areas, I have proposed a number of modifications in these policies. Most of these recommendations relate to the inclusion of an ecosystem perspective in these policies. There is also a need to take a science based approach to policy making which would make these policies more responsive to the increasing threats to coastal risk reduction in the light of climate change. Inclusion of measures to address climate drivers, pressures, impacts and threats would better position these policies in conserving the coastal ecosystems and enhance their capacity for risk reduction

AB  - Coastal zones are experiencing rapid urbanization at unprecedented rates. At the same time, coastal cities are the most prone to climate-related vulnerability, including impacts of sea-level rise and climate-related coastal hazards under the present and projected future climate. Decision making about coastal urban climate adaptation can be informed by coastal climate services based on modeling tools. We develop a two-period coastal urban adaptation model in which two periods—the present and the future—are distinguished. In the model, a city agent anticipates sea-level rise and related coastal flood hazards with adverse impacts in the future period that, through damages, will reduce the urban income. However, the magnitude of future sea-level rise and induced damages are characterized by uncertainty. The urban planning agent has to make an investment decision under uncertainty: whether to invest in climate adaptation (in the form of construction of coastal protection) or not, and if so, how much. The decision making of the urban agent is derived from intertemporal maximization of expected time-discounted consumption. An exact solution in the closed form is derived for an analytically tractable particular case, for which it is shown that investment decisions depend discontinuously on the value of a single non-dimensional model indicator. When this indicator exceeds a certain threshold value, the urban agent discontinuously switches from the ‘business-as-usual’ (BaU) strategy when no adaptation investment is taken to a proactive adaptation. The role of coastal climate services in informing the decision making on adaptation strategies is discussed.

AB  - Coastal zones are bearing the brunt of an increase in the likelihood of extreme events, coupled with sea-level rise (SLR). Conventionally, gray infrastructures, such as seawalls, have been constructed to reduce risks in limited coastal zone spaces. Nature-based approaches, known as green infrastructure, have been used in coastal defense, and their ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction functions (Eco-DRR) have received growing attention. However, both gray and green infrastructure alone have limitations in responding to an ongoing increase in the intensity and frequency of natural hazards. To overcome these issues, hybrid infrastructure, which combine gray and green components, is needed, and they have been receiving growing attention. Meanwhile, a large-scale coastal development requires stakeholder agreement; thus, it is imperative to understand people’s demands and build a consensus between municipalities and coastal citizens in coastal development for long-term resilience. The author administered the online survey across Japan, applying it to the choice experiment, and obtained 840 valid responses. Therefore, this paper clarified the heterogeneities in coastal people’s preferences for coastal ecosystem services provided by gray, green, and hybrid structures in intertidal zones in Japan, recognizing seawalls as gray and coastal pine forests as green infrastructure. Consequently, while coastal citizens acknowledged gray’s coastal defense function, the diverse perceptions toward seawalls for SLR preparation were notable as its scenarios became severe. Another remarkable finding is that nearly 60% of respondents preferred Eco-DRR functions provided by coastal forests with JPY 695 in willingness-to-pay for expanding 100 m in width, even though there are uncertainties in their performances.

AB  - Coastal zones are among the most economically productive areas of the world. However, they are also among the most vulnerable regions to disasters triggered by natural hazards. Recent recognition of the role of healthy coastal and marine ecosystems for reducing vulnerability in coastal communities has led to the design of coastal management strategies that incorporate direct investments in these ecosystems. However, there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of the economic benefits of coastal and marine ecosystems for society, which has led to the degradation of these ecosystems and hindered the prospects of sustainable investments in coastal resilience projects, including green infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the economic importance and ongoing threats of the main marine and coastal ecosystems of the Wider Caribbean region, and identify the underlying economic causes of their deterioration. The need to improve coastal resilience in the Wider Caribbean has led to innovative approaches for the protection of coastal zones and their population from erosion and flood risk, prioritizing the role of marine and coastal ecosystems for coastal protection and vulnerability reduction in coastal communities. Based on this review, we develop an analytical framework for economic analyses and impact evaluations of coastal restoration and protection programs, with the objective of allowing practitioners to properly identify the cost-effectiveness of nature-based solutions for coastal resilience.

AB  - Coastal zones are a much-appreciated environment by society, and support a large amount of economic and leisure activities. Growing demographic pressure on these very special territories that are associated to rapid economic growth and coastward migration has resulted in significant infrastructure and assets located in risk-prone areas, increasing exposure and vulnerability to natural disasters along the coast, including erosion, flooding and salt intrusion. In these areas, sediment transport and erosive processes are worldwide critical aspects for territory planning and management, especially in countries with long coastline like Portugal, since these phenomena often endanger human life and property protection. A research effort is still needed to find more robust and nature-based protection solutions adequate for high energetic coastal environments. The design, construction and maintenance of coastal protection structures incorporating principles of resilience to climate change impacts require a comprehensive multidisciplinary scientific approach for a deep understanding on coastal hydromorphodynamics and on the behaviour of new eco-materials in marine environments. In this research work different methodologies were applied to describe: (i) wave climate regimes under uncertainty of climate changes scenarios off Iberian Peninsula coast; (ii) coastal hydro-morphology dynamics applying numeric modelling tools; and (iii) thermo-mechanical behaviour of an innovative eco-engineering solution for recycled steel fibre reinforced concrete armour unit. The main outcomes of this research are: (i) the determination of 10-, 50-, and 100-year return period of significant wave height and wave peak period values that can be used with confidence as design parameters for structural analyses in maritime works to be built in the western coast off Iberian Peninsula; (ii) results of a comparative study on coastal protection structures to promote wave energy dissipation and sediments retention; (iii) the proposal of an optimized geometry of maritime structures under longitudinal drift reversal conditions based on hydro- and morphodynamics modelling; (iv) a deep study on thermo-mechanical behaviour of a recycled steel fibre reinforced concrete armour unit; and (v) the proposal of an innovative ecoengineering solution for breakwater armour incorporating the new scientific achievements. Globally, this research work aims at the design and assessment of innovative nature-based coastal engineering solutions based on modelling and observation of natural accretion or sedimentary stable processes, and the application of high structural multifunctional eco-materials with high durability and ductility tested through numerical modelling.

AB  - Coastal zone of Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable regions as a severe cyclone strikes Bangladesh’s coast every three years. Bangladesh is also at the receiving end of two-fifth of global storm surge impacts. Addition to death and destruction of coastal population and livelihood, coastal infrastructures, especially polders, as first and only defensive structure against storm surges, pose most threat and often fail to protect hinterland. This study investigated the impact of mangrove afforestation in attenuating storm surge impact on the embankment and economic as well as social benefits of adapting this measure. While, two of the design parameters of afforestation, width and roughness were examined in a hypothetical land, effectiveness of community based afforestation focusing on its technical efficacy, economic feasibility and social benefits were studied for polder 47/4 of Kalapara upazila of Patuakhali district. This study involved application of Delft-3D, a numerical model along with a MATLAB based tool, Delft-Dashboard, Dynamic Force Model (DFM) and a Mapping tool ArcGIS 10.3 to simulate, calculate and visualize inundation condition and thrust force distribution. Primary and secondary source information from various sources was used to validate, modify the model, determine economic feasibility and assess social benefits of afforestation. From this study it is found density and width of a forest plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of mangrove afforestation in attenuating surge propagation and thrust force reduction. Denser forest is more effective in reducing storm surge impacts and as the width increases, for a given value of roughness, efficacy of vegetation also increases. However mangrove afforestation has influence up to a certain region inland (termed as control area) which is a function of afforestation width. But as the control area shifts, area with relatively high inundation moves upward transferring the risk beyond the control area. Existence of polder, while very effective in reducing inundation extent and depth can not reduce thrust force on itself. Combination of both approach exhibits great efficacy in protecting hinterland from inundation and reduced threat to the polder. For polder 47/4, presence of 1.61 km2 afforestation on the foreshore protected additional 3 km2 land from inundation during cyclone SIDR. While increasing polder height to 7 m influenced inundation extent slightly by reducing it 0.3 km2, additional afforestation of same roughness as of existing helped to reduce inundation depth in the hinterland. For this polder, afforestation was found to be more economically feasible measure. Increasing polder height from 4.51 m to 7 m was estimated to cost about Tk. 35,071/m length of the polder. Whereas, cost of protecting 1 m length of polder by providing 1 km afforestation on the foreshore was only Tk.4881.50. Social benefits provided by existing forest was also considerable as local people collects fuel wood and Nipa palm regularly. Fuel wood collection pattern varied spatially (depending on distance of forest from home) and temporally (round the year). While fuel wood was used for non-commercial uses, Nipa palm, on the other hand was used to prepare mat to sell at local market by village women. From the collected data, net benefit of this forest was found to be about Tk. 5990/ha/year.

AB  - Coastal wetlands, beaches and dunes have always played a role in the protection of coastal lowlands. Using their capability to attenuate waves and prevent erosion has gained more momentum in recent years. Critical to their design is an understanding how different parts of the coastal system function as one coastal protection system, with sediment sources and pathways as their basis. A dune depends on its beach, and salt marshes and mangroves depend on a muddy foreshore. Natural systems perform well under natural conditions, but less in the case of extreme storms. Combinations of soft and hard structures may provide the optimized design needed. It is important to design and value soft defenses as multifunctional assets in coastal development and to realign their design to the needs of local communities, so they are fully integrated and their management and long-term presence can be safeguarded. A major challenge is to convince engineers, that there are ‘hard’ arguments for using soft defenses so they are regarded as an engineering challenge.

AB  - Coastal wetlands such as saltmarshes have been increasingly valued for their capacity to buffer global climate change effects, yet their long-term persistence is threatened by environmental changes. Whereas previous studies largely focused on lateral erosion risk induced by stressors like sea level rise, it remains poorly understood of the response of lateral expansion to changing environments. Seedling establishment is a key process governing lateral marsh expansion as seen in many coastal regions such as Europe and East Asia. Here we evaluate mechanistically the response of seed bank dynamics to changing physical disturbance at tidal flats, using the globally common coastal foundation plant, cordgrass as a model. We conducted a large-scale field study in an estuary in Northwest Europe, where seed bank dynamics of cordgrass in the tidal flats was determined and linked to in situ hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. The results revealed that wave disturbance reduced the persistence of seeds on the surface, whereas amplified sediment disturbance lowered the persistence of both surface and buried seeds. Overall, this indicates that increasing storminess and associated sediment variability under climate change threatens seed bank persistence in tidal flats, and hence need urgently be incorporated into models for long-term bio-geomorphological development of vegetated coastal ecosystems. The knowledge gained here provides a basis for more accurate predictions on how climatically driven environmental changes may alter the fitness, resilience and persistence of coastal foundation plants, with significant implications for nature-based solutions with coastal vegetation to mitigate climate change effects.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR) but are also valued for their potential to provide effective nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ecological benefits from these ecosystems can be constrained under urban settings by anthropogenic disturbances and pressures, so restoration activities are promoted as a management approach. Here we report on the potential for restoration of disused commercial salt extraction pans to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in the urban Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. We also considered the impact of SLR to 2100 on the distribution of estuarine habitats, the vulnerability of built infrastructure to tidal flooding, and how C sequestration is projected to change over time using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Potential restoration of all salt pans (320 ha) to estuarine habitat was estimated to result in a gain of 67 850 Mg C. Establishing tidal connectivity was investigated as a potential restoration action, but most of the salt pan area was above the elevation of the current tidal range and would require excavation. Although conversion of the salt pans to estuarine habitat was predicted to occur without intervention under SLR, 44% of the original area would remain unchanged. Restoring hydrological connectivity to the estuary for these salt pans would significantly increase the extent of transitional/floodplain marsh, even under SLR to 2100. C sequestration was predicted to be 15% higher (54 614.8 Mg C) by 2100 if the salt pans could be restored, compared to if no action is taken. Overall, restoration of the salt pans has the potential to enhance C sequestration, but SLR will still cause large losses of supratidal marsh due to ‘coastal squeeze’ and extensive tidal flooding of developed areas by 2100 in the lower reaches of the estuary. A full-scale restoration approach for the Swartkops Estuary could use C sequestration potential to fund the project through carbon offsetting if the revenue exceeds the cost of the restoration activities, but additional social and ecological goals also need to be incorporated if the outcome is to be holistic and beneficial.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are dynamic bio-physical systems in which vegetation affects the movement of water and sediment, which in turn build and maintain the landform and ecosystem. Wetlands are an effective buffer against coastal erosion and flooding, enhance water quality and human health and wellbeing. Numerous field and laboratory experiments have quantified the reduction of waves by coastal ecosystems. Numerical models, however, are only able to capture observed reduction in wave energy when calibration coefficients are obtained by comparison with measured dissipation rates. A deeper understanding of how wave attenuation varies over time, with local flow conditions and ecosystem properties, is still lacking and should be acquired from a greater range of ecosystem types and geographical settings. Few studies have observed the detailed seasonal variations in how coastal wetlands function as wave buffers and how such seasonal variations might be explained. Equally, few studies have focused on the effect of coastal reed beds on wave dynamics. This study addresses both: i) seasonal variability in wave dissipation through reed vegetation and ii) intricate connections between reed vegetation and the physical context (meteorological and topographical) that might explain such variability. We present observations of wind generated wave transformation through two <jats:italic>Phragmites australis</jats:italic> reed beds in the Razelm-Sinoe Lagoon System, Danube Delta, Romania. We find that seasonal changes in vegetation density and biomass, as well as meteorological conditions, affect observed wave conditions within the first few meters of the reed beds. Our results also show a preferential reduction of higher frequency waves, irrespective of reed stem diameter or density and suggest the potential importance of seasonal vegetation debris to observed wave dissipation. Such complex and non-linear biogeomorphic effects on wave dissipation are not currently well understood or captured in the parameterisation of vegetation-induced wave dissipation. Our study highlights the importance of an accurate and temporally granular quantification of nearshore bathymetry, wetland topography, and vegetation to fully understand, model, and manage bio-physical interactions in coastal wetlands. More specifically, our results point towards the need for spatially and temporally explicit wave decay functions in emergent reed vegetation. This is particularly critical where the accurate evaluation of the flood and erosion risk contribution of any wetland is required as part of nature-based coastal protection solutions.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are an effective natural and nature-based feature to mitigate coastal flood hazards. While the sheltering and attenuation offered by wetlands are recognized, the protection level varies based on wetland and storm characteristics. Here we focus on the effects of the spatial scales of the coastal wetlands (i.e., channel geometry, marsh elevation-gradient) and the temporal scales of storm forcing (i.e., storm surge amplitude and duration) on peak water level attenuation. The study was conducted by performing hydrodynamic simulations on an idealized marsh geometry. One hundred seventy-one hydrodynamic simulations were conducted by varying wetland features under variable hydrodynamic forcing. Increased tidal channel area enhances water flow across marshes by reducing the capacity of vegetated platforms to resist propagation of a storm surge. The level of surge attenuation and channel area shows a non-linear relationship. Storm scales also affect surge attenuation for a given channel geometry. Higher amplitudes and lower surge durations provide greater attenuation of peak water levels. The level of attenuation and surge scales also show a non-linear correlation. A multivariate scaling relationship was developed that successfully integrates the combined effects of channel geometry and surge scales on water level attenuation by salt marsh. This research provides guidance to engineers and coastal managers on salt marsh's flood hazard reduction benefits.

AB  - Coastal vulnerability has been gaining recognition as a critical issue, especially with the increasing predictions of sea level rise. Susceptibility to extreme events, eutrophication, and shoreline modification has left many coastal regions in a degraded state. Shoreline protection has traditionally taken the form of seawalls and offshore breakwaters which can be detrimental to both the local ecosystems and adjoining shorelines. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the hydrodynamic and bathymetric variation that occurs within Mosquito Lagoon, Florida following living shoreline and oyster reef restorations. The shoreline sites were sampled using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design and data were analyzed to ascertain the hydrodynamic and bathymetric variations that occurred resulting from plantings of emergent vegetation and deployment of biogenic wave break structures. Turbulent statistics were calculated to determine the effects of nearshore emergent vegetation on the incoming currents and waves. The vegetative growth in conjunction with the wave break structure was shown to reduce the onshore velocities to 46% of those observed at the reference site. Surveys among restored and degraded shorelines and oyster reefs exhibit average crest heights 10-20 cm lower in the restored sites. Nearshore slopes at the hard armored TM Seawall site were over 161% steeper than the restored sites comprised of emergent vegetation and wave break structures implying that scour was present at the toe of the structure from potentially reflected wave energies and increased swash velocities. Quantifying the hydrodynamic and geomorphic processes at work within restored shorelines and reefs may aide managers in best practices both in selection of viable restoration sites and with proper implementation of restoration techniques.

AB  - Coastal vulnerability and its physical, economic and social consequences at national and international scales is of high scientific, political and policy interest. Anthropogenic climate change and coastal erosion threaten the very fabric of a society. Indications, that coastal hazards are impacting diverse coastal areas severely across the world, and it is no longer a vague future threat that can’t be ignored. Rising eustatic sea levels synthesized by the growing frequency and scale of coastal hazards like storm surges, coastal erosion and coastal landslides threaten low-lying and unprotected coastal areas in the United Kingdom even if they have coastal defenses. However, there is still significant uncertainty about the degree of vulnerability along different coastal stretches, particularly in England. To fill this uncertainty, the current study estimated the coastal vulnerability of the coastal erosion hotspot Camber, England, by establishing a coastal vulnerability index. This index was developed by compounding various existing parameters and termed as Erosion Coastal Vulnerability Index (ECVI). Results illustrate that 67% of coastal area fall between high and very high vulnerability categories, and current coastal defenses are not strong enough to tackle the severe coastal erosion in Camber. Within the evaluation, thematic maps were generated to enable the intensity of the vulnerability for different coastal stretches to be identified. The evaluated vulnerable hotspot should be treated urgently by regional and national policy organizations to ameliorate the impacts of coastal erosion and other associated risks. Without action, the hotspot is likely to encounter unprecedented new vulnerabilities, disasters and humanitarian catastrophes. The current study results allow for a local, regional and national comparison that may help to evaluate changes in coastal erosion vulnerability.

AB  - Coastal vegetation can reduce extreme water levels during storm events, but the controlling factors and processes in complex estuary or delta systems are still unclear. This limits an effective implementation of nature-based coastal defences in delta mega-cities in low-lying coastal areas. Here we have numerically modelled how mangroves can offer coastal protection to the large coastal cities located in the Pearl River Delta (China), such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen, during strong typhoons, like Hato (2017). Water level attenuation by mangroves is effective during extreme water level conditions and differences in mangrove forests’ properties drive their coastal protection function. The local (within-wetland) attenuation of extreme water levels is more effective with wide vegetation patches and higher vegetation drag. Narrower vegetation patches can still provide non-local (upstream) water level attenuation if located in the upper estuary channels, but their design needs to avoid amplification of water levels in other delta areas.

AB  - Coastal urbanisation, energy extraction, food production, shipping and transportation have led to the global proliferation of artificial structures within the coastal and marine environments (sensu “ocean sprawl”), with subsequent loss of natural habitats and biodiversity. To mitigate and compensate impacts of ocean sprawl, the practice of eco-engineering of artificial structures has been developed over the past decade. Eco-engineering aims to create sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with the natural environment for the benefit of both. The science of eco-engineering has grown markedly, yet synthesis of research into a user-friendly and practitioner-focused format is lacking. Feedback from stakeholders has repeatedly stated that a “photo user guide” or “manual” covering the range of eco-engineering options available for artificial structures would be beneficial. However, a detailed and structured “user guide” for eco-engineering in coastal and marine environments is not yet possible; therefore we present an accessible review and catalogue of trialled eco-engineering options and a summary of guidance for a range of different structures tailored for stakeholders and end-users as the first step towards a structured manual. This work can thus serve as a potential template for future eco-engineering guides. Here we provide suggestions for potential eco-engineering designs to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services of coastal artificial structures with the following structures covered: (1) rock revetment, breakwaters and groynes composed of armour stones or concrete units; (2) vertical and sloping seawalls; (3) over-water structures (i.e., piers) and associated support structures; and (4) tidal river walls.

AB  - Coastal risks are increasing from both development and climate change. Interest is growing in the protective role that coastal nature-based measures (or green infrastructure), such as reefs and wetlands, can play in adapting to these risks. However, a lack of quantitative information on their relative costs and benefits is one principal factor limiting their use more broadly. Here, we apply a quantitative risk assessment framework to assess coastal flood risk (from climate change and economic exposure growth) across the United States Gulf of Mexico coast to compare the cost effectiveness of different adaptation measures. These include nature-based (e.g. oyster reef restoration), structural or grey (e.g., seawalls) and policy measures (e.g. home elevation). We first find that coastal development will be a critical driver of risk, particularly for major disasters, but climate change will cause more recurrent losses through changes in storms and relative sea level rise. By 2030, flooding will cost $134–176.6 billion (for different economic growth scenarios), but as the effects of climate change, land subsidence and concentration of assets in the coastal zone increase, annualized risk will more than double by 2050 with respect to 2030. However, from the portfolio we studied, the set of cost-effective adaptation measures (with benefit to cost ratios above 1) could prevent up to $57–101 billion in losses, which represents 42.8–57.2% of the total risk. Nature-based adaptation options could avert more than $50 billion of these costs, and do so cost effectively with average benefit to cost ratios above 3.5. Wetland and oyster reef restoration are found to be particularly cost-effective. This study demonstrates that the cost effectiveness of nature-based, grey and policy measures can be compared quantitatively with one another, and that the cost effectiveness of adaptation becomes more attractive as climate change and coastal development intensifies in the future. It also shows that investments in nature-based adaptation could meet multiple objectives for environmental restoration, adaptation and flood risk reduction.

AB  - Coastal restoration is often distrusted and, at best, implemented at small scales, which hampers its potential for coastal adaptation. Present technical, economic and management barriers stem from sectoral and poorly coordinated local interventions, which are insufficiently monitored and maintained, precluding the upscaling required to build up confidence in ecosystem restoration. The paper posits that there is enough knowledge, technology, financial and governance capabilities for increasing the pace and scale of restoration, before the onset of irreversible coastal degradation. We propose a systemic restoration, which integrates Nature based Solutions (NbS) building blocks, to provide climate-resilient ecosystem services and improved biodiversity to curb coastal degradation. The result should be a reduction of coastal risks from a decarbonised coastal protection, which at the same time increases coastal blue carbon. We discuss barriers and enablers for coastal adaptation-through-restoration plans, based on vulnerable coastal archetypes, such as deltas, estuaries, lagoons and coastal bays. These plans, based on connectivity and accommodation space, result in enhanced resilience and biodiversity under increasing climatic and human pressures. The paper concludes with a review of the interconnections between the technical, financial and governance dimensions of restoration, and discusses how to fill the present implementation gap.

AB  - Coastal regions of developing countries are highly vulnerable to climate impacts. Climate change is projected to increase sea level rise, coastal storm events, and natural resource scarcity, impacting coastal ecosystems and societies. These climate impacts intersect with other anthropogenic stressors contributing to the degradation of coastal habitats and ecosystems (driven by, among other things, development, encroachment and pollution), increasing the risk of coastal hazards. Given the complexities of coastal adaptation and the reality of scarce financial and human resources, policymakers must make challenging decisions regarding which adaptation strategies to prioritize. This study seeks to understand: 1) What approaches to coastal adaptation have been most commonly implemented in projects financed through multilateral adaptation funds? and 2) Were the projects designed to build climate-specific or broader adaptive capacity? Using a content analysis of project proposals for 60 coastal adaptation projects financed through multilateral adaptation funds across 39 countries (as well as two regional projects), we categorized adaptation approaches and assessed contributions to adaptive capacity. Our findings indicate that policy, planning, and capacity-building, as compared to more tangible implementation activities, have characterized most coastal adaptation projects in the past 15 years. We also found a common emphasis on climate-specific adaptive capacity which diverges from the widely discussed need to address climate change and development priorities synergistically. In the context of limited resources, decisions regarding which adaptation approaches to invest in inherently involves trade-offs that need to be explicitly acknowledged. While numerous regional studies have analyzed these trade-offs, our study provides a global context and identifies potential areas of underinvestment for coastal adaptation in developing countries.

AB  - Coastal regions are exposed to natural phenomena such as sea waves, sea level rise, climate change, and flooding events. These factors, along with human pressures, lead to an increase in coastal erosion. In response, hard engineering measures were realized as breakwaters and groins, to oppose erosion processes along the sandy beaches of the Italian coastline. These types of defense systems showed negative impacts on landscapes, ecosystems, and expected results. Additionally, the use of coastal revetments, submerged sandbars, soil bioengineering, and beach nourishment projects were used to defend seaboard areas from the risk of a growing shore withdrawal. Among these soft solutions, beach nourishment is becoming an environmentally friendly method to control shoreline erosion, increasing the width of sandy beaches to guarantee a better tourist use of coastal regions and to add a greater buffer between the shoreline and existing infrastructure. In recent times, nourishment projects have been combined with other protective measures, such as submerged sandbars and underwater detached breakwaters, limiting the loss of sediments from sandy beaches and allowing better protection from stormy events. These mixed solutions ensure effective coastal protection by maintaining the width of sandy beaches for tourist use, guaranteeing the environmental safeguard of the coastal ecosystems. In order to achieve the best result with these types of projects, a close collaboration between coastal engineers, geologists, biologists, and policymakers toward integrated coastal zone management is necessary. The study described in this paper has taken the form of a literature review regarding both the negative environmental impacts and the benefits associated with the use of old and new coastal defense systems.

AB  - Coastal protection, an important coral reef ecosystem service, is threatened by increasing coral mortality, exacerbated by global climate change. Nature-based solutions in the form of coral restoration, while not perfect, can assist in rebuilding reef structure and improving the flow of the service for some sites. With a financing gap existing between what is required for conservation and what is being accessed, private investors should be playing a larger role in such restoration activities. Especially so as coastal hoteliers in particular, benefit from stable beaches and also have additional income generating potential with healthy reefs. Blended finance solutions in particular, are especially suited to restoration that incorporates substrate addition, while payments for ecosystem services are more suited to coral gardening. Conservation and finance practitioners must engage further and understand each other’s worlds, in order for these private sources to be effectively sourced and utilized.

AB  - Coastal protection measures can be categorized into grey and green solutions in terms of their ecosystem impacts. As the use of grey solutions has become a serious issue due to environmental consequences during the last few decades, green/nature-based solutions have become prioritized. This study evaluates the effectiveness of grey and green solutions applied along the eastern Chao Phraya Delta (ECPD) based on historical shoreline change analysis and coastal observations using Light Detection and Ranging technology. The results from shoreline analysis indicate that nearshore breakwaters installed 100–250 m from the shoreline have successfully reclaimed the coastline with a sedimentation rate of 17–23 cm/y. Meanwhile, sand-sausage-submerged breakwaters were ineffective at stabilizing the coastline during 2002–2010 due to land subsidence. With a low subsidence rate, the rubble-mound-submerged breakwaters can reduce the shoreline retreat rate with a vertical deposition rate of about 5 cm/y. In contrast, use of a bamboo fence, a green solution widely used along muddy coasts, traps sediment at a rate of less than 1.3 cm/y and typically lasts only for 2–3 years after installation. Decomposed bamboo causes environmental degradation so local communities disapprove of the approach. Results reveal that grey solutions are more effective for stabilizing the ECPD coastline and result in less coastal environmental impact than the nature-based solution using a bamboo fence.

AB  - Coastal protection measures and management play an important role in coping with coastal disasters and climate-induced sea-level rise. In this study, the success and failure of typical coastal protection works of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) are reported and documented from field observations over a study period of 10–15 years. The coastal protection structures evaluated include revetments, geotubes, t-shaped bamboo fences, Pile-rock breakwaters, Busadco's breakwaters, Semi-Circular breakwaters, and Hollow triangle breakwaters. This paper briefly reviews the current situation of coastline erosion problem and accretion in the VMD and illustrates the severity of the current erosion rate that threatens the safety of coastal communities. The paper then evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various coastal management approaches currently in practice in the VMD to classify different types of possible measures for coastal management with the aim to find holistic measures for planning which require low construction investment. Integrated coastal management and planning are outlined at a regional scale followed by the lessons learned from the previous coastal protection works, and finally the multiple lines of defense (MLD) solution is proposed, which is a green infrastructure inspired nature-based solution. The MLD solution can improve biodiversity, facilitate mangrove forest restoration, and ensure sustainable livelihoods for local communities. Integrated coastal planning and management solutions that are based on the MLD principle are expected to withstand coastal disasters under future climate change, and sea-level rise on the VMD.

AB  - Coastal protection has evolved from focusing on hard solutions such as breakwaters and groynes to include soft or nature-based solutions (NbS). NbS have been proposed as cost-effective means to offer long-term coastal protection and at the same time strengthen coastal resilience and biodiversity. However, projects utilizing NbS for coastal protection have often focused on a single solution and the evidence of improved biodiversity remain equivocal. In this paper, we review solutions traditionally used for disparate purposes – namely beach nourishment and the establishment of vascular plants such as seagrass and dune grass. The main incentives behind large-scale beach nourishment projects are often the cost-effectiveness, multifunctionality and dynamic shoreline protection whereas the focus of vegetation restoration has typically been on recreating important habitats and not specifically as a coastal protection measure. Based on previous studies and an on-going large-scale coastal adaptation project in southern Sweden, we investigate the feasibility of combining these seemingly dichotomous management strategies to yield a viable physical defense and at the same time strengthen coastal biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. Given the urgency in combatting biodiversity loss and adapting to a changing climate, management interventions for coastal protection should explicitly incorporate ecological values into every coastal protection measure and seek innovative, integrated approaches that consider both geomorphological and ecological values and the possible complementarity between the two.

AB  - Coastal population is among the most vulnerable to disasters triggered by natural hazards. Recent recognition of the role of coastal and marine ecosystems for reducing vulnerability in coastal communities has led to incorporate direct investments in these ecosystems. However, there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of their economic benefits, and that has hindered the investments on these ecosystems, including natural infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the main economic analysis tools for assessing protection and restauration coastal projects, and identify the innovations and challenges associated. Based on this review, we develop an analytical framework for ex ante and ex post economic analyses of these investments, what will allow the identification of benefits of nature-based solutions for coastal resilience.

AB  - Coastal marine ecosystems provide critical goods and services to humanity but many are experiencing rapid degradation. The need for effective restoration tools capable of promoting recovery of coastal ecosystems and remediating their valued services has never been greater. We identify four major challenges for the future development and implementation of coastal marine ecosystem restoration (MER): (1) Development of more effective, scalable restoration tools, (2) adaptation of restoration tools to cope with climate change and global stressors, (3) integration of social and ecological restoration priorities, and (4) promotion of the perception and use of coastal MER as a scientifically-credible management approach. Tackling these challenges should improve restoration success rates, heighten their recognition, and accelerate investment in and promotion of coastal MER. Here, to reverse the currently accelerating decline of marine ecosystems, we discuss potential directions for meeting these challenges by applying coastal MER tools that are science-based and actionable. For coastal restoration to have a global impact, it must incorporate social science, technological and conceptual advances, and plan for future climates.

AB  - Coastal managers worldwide increasingly recognize the importance of conservation and restoration of natural coastal ecosystems. This ensures coastal resilience and provision of essential ecosystem services, such as wave attenuation reducing coastal flooding and erosion. In the continuum from unvegetated tidal flats to salt marshes and mangroves, fundamental physical controls as well as biotic interactions, and feedbacks among them, determine morphology and vegetation distribution. Although these processes are well described in established literature, this information is rarely applied to understanding the role of these ecosystems as coastal defense. The focus is often on specific elements of the complex system, such as vegetation structure and cover, rather than on their complex natural dynamics. This review examines whether and how the dynamic nature of tidal flat - wetlands systems contributes to, or detracts from, their role in coastal defense. It discusses how the characteristics of the system adjust to external forcing and how these adjustments affect ecosystem services. It also considers how human interventions can take advantage of natural processes to enhance or accelerate achievement of natural coastal defense.

AB  - Coastal infrastructure in the form of seawalls and salt marshes is essential for the success of the economy, society, and environment. Such infrastructure (both natural and constructed) around the world enables trade, connects communities, creates opportunities, and protects from the unpredictable natural environment. Without reliable coastal infrastructure, our nation would not be what it is today, which is why these assets need to be upheld and protected through efficient asset management and monitoring. Unlike sea walls and other gray infrastructure, there is no wellestablished monitoring method for salt marshes in the context of asset management. In this thesis, I evaluate current monitoring methods for gray infrastructure and salt marshes. I use measured salt marsh erosion rates over time in order to develop guidelines for monitoring wave reduction in salt marsh habitats. Salt marsh erosion rates were compared over the years utilizing different environmental thresholds and variations to ensure a conservative approach to monitoring over time. The proposed approach is derived from current asset management approaches for monitoring gray infrastructure. The intent of using an asset management approach was to ensure that the proposed monitoring method fits into universal standards of current infrastructure assessment, in the form of a rating scale. Based on this evidence, a condition assessment rating and maintenance plan for salt marshes is proposed along with recommended remediation methods and hybrid infrastructure plans.

AB  - Coastal hazards pose a significant threat to small islands, especially in combination with Sea Level Rise (SLR). Currently, the small Caribbean island of Bonaire is poorly protected against coastal flooding and there is a lack of local knowledge on potential adaptation options and their benefits and trade-offs. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating how different coastal adaptation options to protect Bonaire are valued, considering economic, social, environmental, and technical criteria. This is evaluated using a participatory Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) that includes key stakeholders through semistructured interviews and the use of an online questionnaire. A wide variety of coastal adaptation options, ranging from grey infrastructure to softer Nature-based Solutions (NbS), is assessed based on an interdisciplinary set of 10 different criteria, providing a holistic view of the consequences of each option. The results show that NbS, especially mangrove restoration, and spatial zoning measures are overall perceived to be most beneficial. The least favourable adaptation strategies include the construction of any type of seawall and doing nothing. While an MCA does not lead to a final perfect solution, it does provide valuable comparative information about potential future adaptation strategies for Bonaire, which can be used to aid policy makers in the decision-making process. Moving forward, it is important to further strengthen the results of this study by conducting additional quantified analyses, including an evaluation of the spatial suitability of specific measures or combinations of measures. Moreover, to ensure public support for any final policy decisions, regardless of the specific measures that are selected, it is vital to keep involving and informing the local community of Bonaire.

AB  - Coastal habitats, such as salt marshes and dune systems, can protect communities from hazards by reducing coastline exposure. However, these critical habitats and their diverse ecosystem services are threatened by coastal development and the impacts from a changing climate. Ever increasing pressure on coastal habitats calls for coastal climate adaptation efforts that mitigate or adapt to these pressures in ways that maintain the integrity of coastal landscapes. An important challenge for decisionmakers is determining the best mitigation and adaptation strategies that not only protect human lives and property, but also safeguard the ability of coastal habitats to provide a broad suite of benefits. Here, we present a potential pathway for local-scale climate change adaptation planning through the identification and mapping of natural habitats that provide the greatest benefits to coastal communities. The methodology coupled a coastal vulnerability model with a climate adaptation policy assessment in an effort to identify priority locations for nature-based solutions that reduce vulnerability of critical assets using feasible land-use policy methods. Our results demonstrate the critical role of natural habitats in providing the ecosystem service of coastal protection in California. We found that specific dune habitats play a key role in reducing erosion and inundation of the coastline and that several wetland areas help to absorb energy from storms and provide a protective service for the coast of Marin county, California, USA. Climate change and adaptation planning are globally relevant issues in which the scalability and transferability of solutions must be considered. This work outlines an iterative approach for climate adaptation planning at a local-scale, with opportunity to consider the scalability of an iterative science-policy engagement approach to regional, national, and international levels.

AB  - Coastal habitats worldwide face the problem of coastal erosion due to natural hazards and human-induced activities. Coastal ecosystems like coral reefs protect shorelines and help manage risk and ensure effective adaptation, among other benefits. Coral reefs reduce wave height, which impacts coastlines, by attenuating more than 85% of incoming wave energy and creating a sheltering effect that facilitates sediment accumulation and shoreline stability. Reef-building oysters also trap sediment, reduce water velocity, and control coastal erosion. Natural reefs provide risk-reduction benefits compared to conventional artificial defenses like seawalls and breakwaters. Reef restoration and enhancement in combination with artificial reefs is also a cost-effective alternative to conventional human made structures. Conservation and preservation efforts to retain existing reefs, restore damaged reefs, and create new ecosystems to replace those that have been lost are necessary for shoreline stabilization. This chapter provides evidence for better assessing the role of reefs in shoreline protection and stability, discusses the importance of reef status in coastal management and protection, identifies how the degradation of reefs will result in severe coastal erosions, and presents advanced ecosystem-based engineering as an effective alternative for climate adaptation and shoreline protection.

AB  - Coastal habitats in the United States have been in decline for centuries, while federal and state policy programs to address their decline have only been developed and implemented over the past few decades. This study set out to understand—based on existing policy, published academic and grey literature, and expert perspectives—the status and stressors for four focal habitats and state governments’ approaches to their restoration and protection. While the report includes illustrative examples of local and state level governmental interventions designed for and, at times, demonstrably effective at protecting and restoring coastal habitats, the key findings suggest that state coastal management remains fragmented and enabling conditions for effective policy hard to identify and therefore are not replicated across states.

AB  - Coastal habitats can substantially reduce the damages caused by coastal storms. However, the value of these natural defences is still not fully recognised. Consequently habitats are being destroyed or severely degraded in many parts of the world. Furthermore, despite widespread interest in natural and nature based coastal defence solutions, the uptake of such approaches is limited by a lack of information on their performance. This paper provides further evidence of the coastal protection value of existing habitats. Field evidence shows that on average, coastal habitats reduce wave heights between 31% and 72%, do provide risk reduction services and can be cheaper than hard structures. The paper also outlines a generic framework the role of natural and nature based approaches to be valued at local/regional/global scales. Application of this approach at a global scale shows that coral reefs provide $6B of coastal protection services annually. The paper concludes with some recommendations for the further research that is needed to support the wider uptake of natural and nature based solutions.

AB  - Coastal flooding, from both extreme events and sea level rise, is one of the top management challenges facing U.S. coastal stakeholders today. The intensity of coastal flooding is expected to increase with global sea level rise. This paper focuses on flooding challenges from the perspective of coastal communities. The myriad of flood mitigation strategies that have been implemented across the U.S. vary based on a multitude of factors including spatio-temporal scale of the coastal flooding hazard. ASBPA administered a survey of 106 coastal stakeholders from around the U.S. to assess specific community challenges and needs related to coastal flooding in late 2021. A majority of respondents indicated that their community includes an underserved population or neighborhood (54%) or nearby communities do (25%). While the vast majority of survey respondents indicated that flooding was a major challenge, only 24% of respondents’ communities have a coastal flooding adaptation plan. Improvements to drainage systems are the most commonly implemented gray infrastructure strategy in the Southeast and Gulf coast regions. Respondents from all regions noted that beach and dune restoration has been the most widely implemented nature-based flood mitigation strategy. Interest is now high in other nature-based solutions with application in low-lying, vulnerable coastal areas such as thin-layer placement on marshes, living shorelines, and hybrid projects on estuarine shorelines. This paper does not provide an exhaustive review of the science, forcings, or policies on coastal flooding in the U.S.; rather, it captures the perspectives of coastal communities and aims to inform and prioritize future research investments related to coastal flooding.

AB  - Coastal flooding and erosion cause significant social and economic impacts, globally. There is a growing interest in using natural habitats such as mangroves to defend coastlines. The protective services of mangroves, however, have not been assessed in the same rigorous engineering and socio-economic terms as rock revetments, and therefore are often overlooked by coastal managers. We used field measurements, a social science survey and economic valuation to compare the coastal protection services of mangroves and rock revetments, at five locations across Victoria, Australia. The results showed, in sheltered locations, both mangroves and rock revetments attenuated waves, however, the wave attenuation (per metre) of rock revetments was greater than mangroves, at two of the five locations. Only a small proportion of the survey respondents had observed flooding or erosion in their suburb but most agreed that mangroves provide important coastal protection benefits. Coastal landowners visited areas with mangroves more often than the public but were less likely to worry about the links between climate change and coastal erosion and flooding, or to agree that the coast was well protected with existing artificial coastal infrastructure, than other respondents. There were much higher up-front costs associated with building rock revetments, than planting mangroves, but rock revetments required less land than mangroves. Mangroves covered a larger area and averted more damages than rock revetments. Coastal managers and policy makers will have more success in advocating for nature-based solutions for coastal protection, if they are implemented in locations where they are eco-engineering and socio-economically acceptable options for climate change adaptation.

AB  - Coastal flood risk is a serious global challenge facing current and future generations. Several disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures have been posited as ways to reduce the deleterious impacts of coastal flooding. On the global scale, however, efforts to model the effects of DRR measures (beyond structural) in the future are limited. In this paper, we use a global-scale flood risk model to estimate the risk of coastal flooding, and to assess and compare the effectiveness and economic performance of various DRR measures, namely: dykes and coastal levees, dry-proofing of urban assets, zoning restrictions in flood-prone areas, and management of foreshore vegetation. To assess the effectiveness of each DRR measure, we determine the extent to which they can limit future flood risk as a percentage of regional GDP to the same value as today (the so-called relative-risk constant objective). To assess their economic performance, we estimate the economic benefits and costs. If no DRR measures are taken in the future, we estimate expected annual damages to exceed $2 trillion USD by 2080, directly affecting an estimated 15 million people. Over 90 % of sub-national regions in the world can achieve their relative-risk constant targets if at least one of the investigated DRR measures is employed. At the global scale, we find the effectiveness of dykes and coastal levees in achieving the relative-risk constant objective to be 98 %, dry-proofing to be 49 %, zoning restrictions to be 11 %, and foreshore vegetation to be 6 %. In terms of direct costs, the overall figure is largest for dry-proofing ($151 billion) and dykes and coastal levees ($86 billion), much more than those of zoning restrictions ($27 million) and foreshore vegetation ($366 million). While zoning restrictions and foreshore vegetation achieve the highest global benefit-cost ratios, they also provide the least benefits overall. We show that there are large regional patterns in both the effectiveness and economic performance of modelled DRR measures. Future research could assess the indirect costs and benefits of these four and other DRR measures as well as their subsequent hybridisation.

AB  - Coastal flood risk facing urban communities is increasing due to the compound impacts of sea level rise (SLR) and urban growth. Accurate information on future dynamic risk of coastal flooding and its physical and socio-economic drivers is essential for planning effective and targeted adaptation. However, the current scenarios regarding urban development are insufficient to predict the future dynamic spatial distribution of urban socio-economic and physical growth, hindering the exact and dynamic assessment of future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban development to the future dynamics of city-level coastal flood risk have not been examined. Therefore, here we developed a land use-based urban growth scenario for the temporally and spatially explicit simulation of future urban growth in terms of buildings, roads and electrical facilities, and combined it with a local temporally explicit SLR scenario, into a “hazard-exposure-vulnerability” model, for the purpose of dynamic risk assessment of coastal flooding on the urban built environment in Xiamen, China by 2050, and accordingly examined the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth. Our results demonstrated a good performance of the land use-based urban growth model. SLR and urban growth will increase future coastal flood risk (represented by the expected annual damage, EAD) in varying degrees, but their combination is projected to exacerbate future flood damages significantly, indicating that considering either SLR or urban growth in isolation will underestimate future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth are dynamic over time, depending on the rate of SLR and the stage of urbanization: for example, the change in coastal flood risk is mainly attributable to urban growth in the phase of rapid urbanization before 2033 in Xiamen, yet the contribution of urban growth then becomes less important compared to SLR, when urbanization slows down, while SLR reaches a threshold after accelerating growth. The approach and results of our study can be considered a decision support tool, to help decision makers assess future coastal flood risk and detect the relative importance of each driving force, in order to employ land use planning, nature-based solutions and engineering protection, to achieve sustainable and resilient coastal cities.

AB  - Coastal erosion, whether natural or anthropogenic induced, is a worldwide problem. Coastal areas are however often densely populated, making erosion mitigation solutions essential. However, solution knowledge is limited for tropical mud coasts and these mainly developing countries are characterized by weak coastal management. Traditionally hard solutions were implemented. They can cause biodiversity losses, potentially increasing community vulnerability. Furthermore, the instability of mud forms an engineering problem. This indicates the need for Nature Based Solutions (NBS). Although mud recharge and seagrass are identified in design guidelines as NBS, potential ways and success and failure factors of implementation and efficiency in erosion mitigating are absent. Furthermore, an erosion hotspots overview along tropical mud coasts is lacking. This study firstly aimed to provide an erosion hotspot overview. Secondly, to evaluate restoration techniques of mud recharge and seagrass for tropical mud coasts, complemented by identifying their erosion mitigation effectiveness and success and failure factors of implementation. Identifying erosion hotspots was done with satellite data, complemented with qualitative literature the determine coastal sediment characteristics. Evaluation of restoration techniques was based on analysis of documented projects, backed up by qualitative and quantitative data from literature. Erosion along tropical mud coasts occurs most often in Asia and North and South America. More erosion hotspots are found along open coasts compared to bays, estuaries and barrier coasts. Evaluation of mud recharge schemes indicated direct confined intertidal placement and trickle charge aided in mitigating erosion in estuaries and bays intertidally. Seagrass has been restored with some success in bays, estuaries and barrier coasts. Restoration was achieved with planting subtidal sods or intertidal and/or subtidal anchored rhizome fragments to staples or weights. Erosion mitigation cannot be provided by every species in every location and/or scenario. Findings should be taken with caution due to limited availability of mud recharge and seagrass restoration projects. Long term survival of seagrass is uncertain due to its vulnerability to anthropogenic threats. However, seagrass is linked to high fishery production. When energetic conditions are not restricting and ample of donor bed is available, choosing anchored rhizome fragments above sods is advised. The first is less labor intensive, costly and impacting to donor sites. Mud recharge is ill-advised in areas with sensitive marine life or commercial activities like shellfishery due to increased levels of turbidity. When chosen, trickle charge is advised above direct placement due to its lower recharge rate.

AB  - Coastal erosion, aggravated by coral reef mortality is a major issue for Small Island Developing States. Traditionally gray infrastructure, financed by public budgets has been used to combat beach loss. We examined if three Nature-based Solutions (NbS): (i) coral restoration (green) (ii) restoration + limestone (hybrid) and (iii) restoration + 3D printed concrete (hybrid) could deliver positive outcomes for coastal protection and further incentivize cost sharing for reef conservation, with private beneficiaries. We modelled the impact of restoration on wave attenuation at two reefs off Barbados and simulated up-front and maintenance costs over a 25-year period. All solutions provide additionality when compared to gray infrastructure, especially in mitigating against Sea Level Rise. Restoration was the least costly with the highest risk of failure. The hybrid solutions, were less risky than the green as they provided immediate wave attenuation, alongside complementary services such as increased attractiveness due to the presence of reef fish. Their costs were however between +80% and +450% higher than gray solutions. While this might initially deter the use of NbS, blended finance and in some cases, Payments for Ecosystem Services, could provide options for governments and private beneficiaries to share costs, with ultimately greater benefits for themselves and coral reefs.

AB  - Coastal erosion rates on Prince Edward Island (PEI) are increasing due to climate change. Wave action continuously works on the unconsolidated till and sandstone banks, eroding and receding coastlines, while nourishing beaches and estuaries. This causes intensified risk to properties, infrastructure, and humans. Hard engineered structures are common, short-term, solutions to coastal erosion. These structures disrupt the natural land-water interaction as wave energy is deflected at the structure and dispersed to adjacent areas, increasing erosion. Living shorelines are used as alternatives to hard structures by incorporating natural materials, such as vegetation, to provide coastal protection. Living shorelines are long-term methods for coastal erosion. These adaptations act as wave energy barriers and sediment traps, slowing erosion rates. Certain characteristics and baseline conditions such as vegetation, geology, geomorphology, sediment, and differing exposure types are required for living shoreline techniques to reap their intended benefits. Tools to assess site suitability for living shorelines, available online or through documents, are critiqued. The critique is based on how well the tool characterizes PEI, signifying how useful it would be if used as an assessment resource for the suitability of living shorelines. A multicriteria evaluation was conducted in ArcGIS Pro to identify segments of the shoreline that were suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable for implementing living shorelines. This model was tested using 31 field sites surveyed between July-August 2021. With this information, governments and coastal property owners will be able to determine whether or not their property would benefit from installation of living shorelines.

AB  - Coastal erosion occurs along many of the world’s shorelines, but is of particular concern to small islands. In response, island shorelines are often armoured through engineered structures such as seawalls, rip-raps, dikes or similar. Such hard protection is rarely successful in island contexts; rather than stop erosion, hard protection often simply redistributes and sometimes exacerbates shoreline erosion, and fails to protect property, land and food production. Such hard-protection structures frequently collapse shortly after construction. Why then does hard protection remain widespread? We argue that diffusion, specifically learning and emulation, helps explain the spread of hard protection. Island communities learn from the apparent effectiveness of hard protection in some contexts, and consider it an appropriate and accepted response to coastal erosion, regardless of its actual consequences (emulation). Case studies from the Pacific (Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia) and Indian Ocean (Maldives, Mauritius) show that both mechanisms are at work in small island states (SIDS) and may be mutually reinforcing. The case studies underline the role of the specific context in the understanding of not only why a specific adaptation measure is introduced, but also how it may change and evolve over time—and accordingly, when and how communities can move to more effective and sustainable alternatives to hard protection.

AB  - Coastal erosion is a complex and increasingly important problem, largely due to its effects and management strategies. The current context of climate change, together with centuries of human occupation of shorelines, adds pressure for the development of sustainable coastal management policies, the success of which crucially depends on the consideration of all stakeholders’ perspectives. This research investigates users’ preferences over alternative options of coastal erosion management. Through the implementation of a discrete choice experiment, respondents’ preferences regarding management alternatives are elicited, and their willingness to pay for alternatives’ attributes is estimated. The results show that respondents prefer some interventions to mitigate the problem rather than no action, and prefer lighter intervention (palisades, gangways) to heavy infrastructures (rockfills, seawalls, groynes). Moreover, the results show the presence of preference heterogeneity and thus the need to use more flexible and complex models. Based on the results obtained, it is possible to drive some policy implications. First, the do-nothing option is not viable from the population’s standpoint; second, although some type of coastal erosion protection is demanded by the general population, the preferred approach is for light forms, contrary to the policy adopted in the last century, and still overwhelmingly present in the territory. Lastly, given the considerable heterogeneity in respondents’ preferences, careful consideration of the welfare impact of coastal interventions by population segments is required.

AB  - Coastal erosion and flooding are serious threats across many coastal areas. They become globally more severe due to human-induced changes and accelerated sea-level rise. A significant proportion of beaches are undergoing long-term chronic erosion globally and on the Indian coast that leads to the loss of land and degradation of habitats. Several approaches have been attempted to control erosion and protect the coastal areas by adopting a hard coastal defence structure in response to these threats. Ministry of Earth Sciences through National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) and National Institute of Ocean Technology have devised nature-based solutions for the protection and restoration of beach. Here, we describe two recent beach protection and restoration schemes that use non-traditional soft approaches to prevent erosion and restore beaches. A detailed description of the environmental conditions at the site, implemented schemes and the morphological evolution are discussed. Both sites show significant growth in beach width and volume post implementation, contributing to socioeconomic development. Similar strategies can be adopted and implemented at other sites that are undergoing chronic erosion.

AB  - Coastal engineering involves planning, designing and building measures in the coastal zone in order to protect assets from coastal erosion and/or flooding. Coastal erosion involves coastal recession or beach lowering, whilst flooding involves the inundation of low-lying areas due to seawater inundation or wave overtopping. Intervention can take the form of ‘hard’ structures (e.g. seawalls), or softer approaches which attempt to have a beneficial influence on coastal processes and in doing so improve the level of service provided by a sea defence or coast protection structure (e.g. beach recharge). These different measures and their suitability to different situations are discussed in this chapter.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows, have been heralded as a nature-based solution for coastal protection. However, the functions of seagrass meadows, including wave attenuation and sediment stabilisation, have typically been measured offshore and do not directly translate to coastal protection at the shoreline. In contrast, the protective effects of conventional submerged structures, such as breakwaters and artificial reefs, on adjacent shorelines have been well described and are predictable. Importantly, these artificial structures often cause erosion in adjacent areas. This study examines how seagrass may affect shoreline morphodynamics by making inferences from existing knowledge of conventional submerged structures. Both conventional submerged structures and seagrass meadows affect wave height and direction, yet this effect on longshore sediment transport has only been considered within the context of coastal defence structures. From the conventional literature on submerged structures, it is known that a constant rate of longshore sediment transport will result in a constant shoreline shape. Therefore, a change in the rate of longshore sediment transport, or gradient, generates changes in the shoreline shape and, hence, the shoreline morphodynamics. We propose that seagrass also has spatially heterogeneous effects on shoreline morphodynamics, with protection occurring in some locations and downstream erosion likely in others. Empirical and modeling research is required to test this hypothesis. In the meantime, this review suggests contexts under which seagrass may affect shoreline morphodynamics and provide shoreline protection. This research bridges the gaps in knowledge across marine ecology, physical oceanography and coastal engineering to overcome some of the challenges of interdisciplinary coastal science.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide multiple, valuable services including coastal protection but are globally threatened by human-induced and natural pressures. Traditionally, coastal protection has relied on hardening the shoreline using structures that are difficult to modify or remove once in place and, frequently have negative impacts on adjacent coastlines and coastal ecosystems. Consequently there is growing interest in the design and engineering of "nature-based solutions" (NBS) as elements of coastal protection that are flexible and sustainable and also help maintain or enhance ecosystem health. Despite the increasing interest and body of scientific research around NBS, there remains a gap with regard to guidance and understanding on how these solutions can be managed and integrated within traditional coastal engineering practice. This is partly due to the fact that NBS straddle two distinct disciplines–ecology and engineering. However, the coastal engineering profession has considerable expertise and experience with tools and approaches that can be applied to ecosystem based solutions. Likewise, the vast knowledge on the ecology of coastal ecosystems can help address many of the challenges raised by the consideration NBS for coastal protection. This work reviews the design approach and process within commonly used coastal engineering frameworks in the context of NBS, to find common grounds and overarching principles. Existing guidelines for traditional engineering structures are compared and contrasted with those for NBS to contextualize the position of NBS within engineering practice. A parallelism is thus drawn between NBS and traditional coastal engineering, acknowledging their differences, to provide insights on ways in which NBS can be integrated with standard coastal engineering practice, ultimately, to achieve the dual goals of coastal protection and habitat conservation.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems consist of diverse habitats, such as reed beds, salt marshes, mangrove swamps, tidal flats, river deltas, seagrass fields, coral reefs, sandy/rocky-shore beaches and other habitats that harbour biodiversity. The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011 caused severe damage to one-third of the fishing communities along the Pacific Ocean of NE Japan. Coastal species, such as seagrasses, function as nursery areas for commercially important species. Coastal ecosystems provide natural infrastructure for the prevention and reduction of hazardous events, a process known as ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR). The preparation of topographic and thematic maps of coastal marine environments is essential to establish and visualize the concept of Eco-DRR. Experience gained following the Japanese earthquake, as well as examples from Indonesia and Thailand in the wake of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, showed that Eco-DRR is an affordable and sustainable approach. Dissemination of habitat maps should be further promoted as a way to ‘Build Back Better’. To scale up and promote Eco-DRR, scientists must work in a transdisciplinary manner and engage with society by understanding the roles of ecosystems by monitoring and analysing, providing solutions and raising the awareness of community and policy makers, enabling them to better implement Eco-DRR.

AB  - Coastal disasters are increasing and one important cause which is being underplayed under a powerful climate change lobby is overconsumption along the coasts both of land and sea resources. Fish and other sea animals, coastal vegetation and plankton are fast depleting, which is leading to reduced carbon sequestration which can withstand sea level rise and counter negative climate impacts. The laws and policies along the coasts are expected to develop a zero tolerance policy toward overuse of coastal ecosystems and to generate sustainable systems, which is the only solution at hand that involves coastal communities.

AB  - Coastal communities in tropical environments are at increasing risk from both environmental degradation and climate change and require urgent local adaptation action. Evidences show coral reefs play a critical role in wave attenuation but relatively little direct connection has been drawn between these effects and impacts on shorelines. Reefs are rarely assessed for their coastal protection service and thus not managed for their infrastructure benefits, while widespread damage and degradation continues. This paper presents a systematic approach to assess the protective role of coral reefs and to examine solutions based on the reef's influence on wave propagation patterns. Portions of the shoreline of Grenville Bay, Grenada, have seen acute shoreline erosion and coastal flooding. This paper (i) analyzes the historical changes in the shoreline and the local marine, (ii) assess the role of coral reefs in shoreline positioning through a shoreline equilibrium model first applied to coral reef environments, and (iii) design and begin implementation of a reef-based solution to reduce erosion and flooding. Coastline changes in the bay over the past 6 decades are analyzed from bathymetry and benthic surveys, historical imagery, historical wave and sea level data and modeling of wave dynamics. The analysis shows that, at present, the healthy and well-developed coral reefs system in the southern bay keeps the shoreline in equilibrium and stable, whereas reef degradation in the northern bay is linked with severe coastal erosion. A comparison of wave energy modeling for past bathymetry indicates that degradation of the coral reefs better explains erosion than changes in climate and historical sea level rise. Using this knowledge on how reefs affect the hydrodynamics, a reef restoration solution is designed and studied to ameliorate the coastal erosion and flooding. A characteristic design provides a modular design that can meet specific engineering, ecological and implementation criteria. Four pilot units were implemented in 2015 and are currently being field-tested. This paper presents one of the few existing examples available to date of a reef restoration project designed and engineered to deliver risk reduction benefits. The case study shows how engineering and ecology can work together in community-based adaptation. Our findings are particularly important for Small Island States on the front lines of climate change, who have the most to gain from protecting and managing coral reefs as coastal infrastructure.

AB  - Coastal communities in Pacific Island Countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts including sea-level rise, coastal erosion, tidal inundation, and the intensification of storm surge activity. In response, adaptation projects across the region have attempted to reduce exposure and overall vulnerability to these coastal pressures. This paper explores what happens once these projects reach communities: are effective and sustainable outcomes achieved, or can the implementation of adaptation projects lead to unintended negative outcomes and result in maladaptation? This paper investigates this issue in relation to two seawall projects implemented in communities on Vanua Levu Island, Fiji. We found that the seawalls have not been successful in achieving their primary aim of safeguarding communities against coastal pressures and have instead resulted in unanticipated negative outcomes for land and livelihood security. Of primary concern is the way that seawalls trap water along their landward sides—acting more like a dam—because of the ineffective design and construction of the seawalls and associated infrastructure. This paper concludes with a call to think more long-term about site-specific adaptation measures that actively involve and are driven by local perspectives in the planning, implementation, and maintenance process.

AB  - Coastal communities are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and its effects may push coastal ecosystems to undergo irreversible changes. This is especially true for shorebirds with the loss of biodiversity and resource-rich habitats to rest, refuel, and breed. To protect these species, it is critical to conduct research related to nature-based Solutions (NbS). Through a scoping review of scientific literature, this paper initially identified 85 articles with various ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies that could help conserve shorebird populations and promote ecotourism. Of these 85 articles, 28 articles had EbA strategies that were examined, with some like coral reefs and mangroves eliminated as they were inappropriate for this region. The scoping review identified four major EbA strategies for the Greater Niagara Region with living shorelines and beach nourishment being the most suitable, especially when combined. These strategies were then evaluated against the eight core principles of nature-based solutions protecting shorebird as well as human wellbeing. Living shoreline strategy was the only one that met all eight NbS principles. As the coastline of the region greatly varies in substrate and development, further research will be needed to decide which EbA strategies would be appropriate for each specific area to ensure their efficacy.

AB  - Coastal communities are facing two compounding issues: increased natural hazards and declining natural defenses. Around the world coastal communities must find a way to protect themselves against these issues and are turning to nature-based solutions as an alternative to traditional coastal protection structures like sea walls and dikes. This work looks at living artificial reef structures as a semi-natural offshore breakwater that has the possibility to slow down increased coastal erosion by examining different coral configuration’s effect on current velocities. Using an Aquadopp, acoustic doppler current profiler velocity measurements were taken before and after the reef structure. In examining a variety of wave conditions from wind and paddle generated waves the reef structure has an impact on current velocities with an increase or decrease in wave velocities partially depending on the coral configuration and wave condition.

AB  - Coastal cities in parts of Indonesia are subject to many compounding pressures, including increasing population and industrial agglomeration, and are experiencing greater levels of relative sea level rise (SLR) given the impacts of climate change and large-scale subsidence. The sustainability and resilience of many coastal cities is being tested as they struggle to integrate many socio-technical, political and ecological dependencies within the city with the surrounding coastal environment. Governments at all levels have implemented a diversity of strategies to arrest relative sea level rise, but given the ‘wicked’ nature of this problem, both policy solutions, proposed and implemented, have rarely achieved the outcomes needed. To a large extent, this is attributed to the ineffective governance framework which has led to policy failure, with multiple actors being motivated by different legislative, political, financial and social interests who prioritize specific beneficiaries and solutions. This article examines the governance challenges associated with sea level rise through case studies in Semarang and Demak, Indonesia. It highlights significant barriers that impede effective coastal adaptation including (1) the policy and motivations of differing levels of government. This includes a national government that emphasizes mega-infrastructure projects, a regional government that lacks the capacity and resources to address groundwater extraction and a local government that seeks low-cost hybrid engineering solutions given their financial and budgetary constraints; and (2) ipso facto a lack of coordination across scale, jurisdiction and sectors. This article also highlights several opportunities for community and civil society participation in nature-based solution (NBS) practices and implementation. This article finds that effective adaptation strategies in coastal areas require an integrated governance framework to improve policy implementation and coordination.

AB  - Coastal cities face flood-related hazards exacerbated by climate change and sea level rise, including erosion, storm surge, high wave events, and increased flood frequencies. In order to minimize flood damage and prolong the use of coastal lands, nature-based infrastructure and living shorelines can provide habitat, dissipate wave energy, and maintain people’s connection to the water. In this chapter, the living shorelines approach to planning, designing, and evaluating resilient coastal communities is described and evaluated for two different communities on the island of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i. One is a rural, high energy wave environment, Sunset Beach, while the other is a medium wave energy, urban resort district, Waikiki Beach. After identifying flood risks over time, site-specific restoration of coastal sand dunes, vegetation (groundcover, shrubs, trees), and coral reefs are proposed through interactive visualization methods alongside supporting case studies. The principles, tools, and techniques for planners, designers, and practitioners involved in coastal hazard mitigation and adaptation are described. Future research needs are identified such as quantify flood mitigation effectiveness; measure costs and benefits; and enact policies to require consideration and ease implementation of living shorelines.

AB  - Coastal cities are susceptible to the impacts of waves, flooding, storm surge, and sea-level rise. In response to these threats, coastal jurisdictions have invested in engineered shoreline defenses such as breakwaters and sea walls that are costly to implement and maintain. Thus, there is an increasing recognition that nature-based defenses provided by healthy ecosystems like coral reefs can be an effective and cost-efficient alternative to mitigate the impacts of climatic hazards while simultaneously restoring ecosystem services. Unfortunately, coral reefs have experienced degradation worldwide, lowering their potential for wave-energy dissipation. As coastal vulnerability increases with the loss of natural barriers, it is imperative to design and test novel resilience solutions. Our study quantifies the benefits of hybrid artificial reefs for wave mitigation in a wave-tank simulator using periodic waves of three heights (0.10, 0.16, and 0.24 m) at two water levels (0.55 and 0.65 m) defined considering the Froude similarity with a prototype reef structure in South Florida. Experiments showed that an artificial trapezoidal reef model reduces wave height (> 35%) and wave energy (up to 63%) under realistic wave conditions. Moreover, adding coral skeletons of Acropora cervicornis to simulate reef restoration onto the model mitigates up to an additional 10% of wave height and 14% of wave energy through increased friction, supporting the use of hybrid approaches that integrate both gray and green infrastructure to enhance coastal resilience. Exploring wave-tank simulations provides a better understanding of wave effects before implementing larger and more costly projects in the field.

AB  - Coastal carbon sequestration, in this report, refers to carbon dioxide (CO2) removal from the atmosphere in conjunction with plant growth and the accumulation and burial of plant organic carbon (OC) residue in the soil of tidal wetland and seagrass ecosystems. Tidal wetlands, including salt marshes and mangroves, thrive in soft-sediment, shallow regions of estuaries between high and mean sea level, while seagrasses inhabit adjacent soft-sediment estuarine bottoms with adequate light penetration. Macroalgal systems such as kelp forests, while extremely productive, do not have root systems and soils to accumulate carbon (Howard et al., 2017). Little is known about the fate of macroalgal OC, a portion of which could potentially be sequestered by other means when exported from the macroalgal bed (Krause-Jensen et al., 2018). Further understanding of macroalgal transport processes or other farming approaches that could permanently remove CO2 from the atmosphere is needed to assess the potential for globally significant levels of CO2 sequestration. Given the state of research on this topic, which is summarized in Appendix C, the CO2 removal capacity of macroalgal storage is not a focus of this chapter. Other ocean-based negative emissions technologies (NETs), such as sequestration in microbial or planktonic biomass (Zhang et al., 2017b) and ocean alkalization (Rau et al., 2013; Renforth and Henderson, 2017), may be conducted in the coastal environment but are essentially open ocean approaches. They remove carbon through very different mechanisms from coastal wetlands, which bear closer similarity to terrestrial-based NETs. As described in Chapter 1, these approaches are not included in this report and warrant further investigation because of the potentially large role that ocean sinks can play in CO2 removal.

AB  - Coastal Blue Carbon Resources (CBCRs), including mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, provide a unique opportunity for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to combat their extreme climate change vulnerabilities and achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Before accessing the wealth of CBCR ecosystem services and economic opportunities, however, SIDS often struggle to access financial resources to fund coastal habitat management — the main constraint limiting SIDS climate adaptation projects.1 In distilling information from peer-reviewed literature, governmental reports, and project assessments from NGOs, this report summarizes the biological aspects of CBCRs, ocean governance mechanisms, and innovative financial mechanisms for CBC initiatives for SIDS. To overcome the scientific and policy challenges of accessing the international CBC market, SIDS would greatly benefit from accelerating national assessments of their CBCRs through multilateral collaborations with local stakeholders and international partners. Building capacity in SIDS will enable the successful acquisition of multilateral funds and market-based mechanisms to not only develop and strengthen CBC initiatives in SIDS, but also mobilize their global climate-based commitments.

AB  - Coastal blue carbon activities are being implemented by a variety of countries, using different approaches. Existing regulatory regimes, including on coastal protection, are still very useful tools to protect and conserve mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, and preserve their carbon value and role. These approaches suffer, however, from ‘traditional’ issues such as lack of enforcement, human and financial constraints as well as unclear or misguiding government mandates. Successes are witnessed using a community-based carbon project approach, ensuring high stakeholder participation via direct or indirect incentive programmes. Comprehensive coastal zone management approaches seem very promising, but success overall, and regarding carbon specifically, are yet to be reported. The Paris Agreement has introduced new tools which could serve as means to trigger more and better coastal adaptation and mitigation efforts. Their implementation details are, however, still under negotiation and their impacts can only be expected in a few years.

AB  - Coastal areas, especially deltas, are some of the most urbanized territories in the world. Historically, the natural richness and strategic location of these areas resulted attractive for human settlements worldwide. However, these areas are also highly vulnerable due to rapid and unplanned urbanization, land use changes, and extreme climate events. There is an international consensus on the need for new strategies for sustainable development to help cities to mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as adapt to new changing conditions in a context of increasing uncertainty. This paper will explore the specific aspects of urban deltas and coastal areas, from a complexity-based approach, and analyse Nature-based Solutions as alternatives towards sustainable development in these areas.

AB  - Coastal areas in developing countries are very vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise. Adaptation to sea-level rise through protection measures can include both engineering and nature-based solutions. However, comparative economic analyses across both types of solutions are sparse. Moreover, stated preference studies in developing countries that are commonly applied to estimate the benefits of adaptation projects increasingly include time payments as an alternative to money payments. The implications of this payment mode on policy recommendations remains unclear. In this study, we conduct cost-benefit analyses (CBA) that incorporate the results of discrete choice experiments with money as well as time payments for both an engineering (groynes) and a nature-based (beach nourishment) solution. We provide a range of sensitivity analyses regarding discount rates, effectiveness of the measures, cost estimates and different projections in the benefit calculations. These quantitative CBAs are complemented by qualitative insights from focus group discussions. We find overall negative net present values of both engineering and nature-based erosion solutions when money payments are applied, but positive values when time payments are applied. Qualitative insights describe the disruptive effects of erosion on local livelihoods. The qualitative results combined with previous studies’ results provide support for the use of the time payment results. Furthermore, our results indicate that nourishment has a larger positive effect on welfare than groynes. These results provide relevant insights for decision-makers regarding coastal adaptation and stated preference practitioners in developing countries regarding the use of time payments.

AB  - Coastal areas host a significant part of the world population and of humankind’s adaptation needs in the face of effects of climate change, especially sea-level rise and ocean warming and acidification. Atoll islands illustrate frontline situations due to their biophysical (low elevation, small land area, 360°-exposure to waves, limited natural resources and fragile ecosystems) and human (high population densities in urban environments, low level of development, limited technical and financial capacities) characteristics. In these contexts, it is urgent to understand the space for societal adaptation and based on this, identify robust and context-specific adaptation strategies. This essay builds on the hypothesis that, given the nature of atoll islands, understanding the way and extent to which local human-driven disturbances affect the reef-island system’s capacity to provide coastal protection services, is a relevant entry point. Using the case of the Maldives, we propose to combine five types of adaptation into a generic adaptation pathway, and apply it to atoll island types going from no to highly disturbed environments. This work highlights two major conclusions: first, that diverse island profiles require different adaptation pathways; second, that in contexts under high human pressure, the window of opportunities for diversified adaptation strategies is closing fast.

AB  - Coastal areas are urbanizing rapidly, currently supporting >40% of the world's population. Yet, coastal cities are facing greater vulnerability to climate-change-related hazards (e.g., flooding), causing significant social and economic disruptions. Investing in the protection of existing coastal habitats is considered a low-cost nature-based solution (NBS) with co-benefits for society and biodiversity. In this study, we examine the global applicability of this solution across 5,096 coastal urban areas in tropical and subtropical regions. We discover large conservation opportunities for urban areas within an adjacent 50 km buffer zone, where a large proportion of coastal habitat remains (93%). This work prompts actions of coastal habitat protection across coastal cities of Asia and Africa where nature still exists in close proximity to cities, threats from sea-level rise and storm surge are high, and populations are large and growing. This work aims to initiate a pathway whereby decision makers can evaluate interdisciplinary characteristics of an area to prescribe suitable NBS to efficiently address these global challenges.

AB  - Coastal areas are under a constant pressure due to the impacts of climate change and consequences of drastic land use transformation. In Corinto, Nicaragua two different measures have been adopted in order to cope with these challenges. On the one hand there is an engineeredbased solution, namely the implementation of Geotubes to diminish coastal erosion, losses of housing; the second is restoration of the natural mangrove ecosystem which protects the coast also from erosion, as well as flooding and provides other ecosystem services. The study assesses the success and improvement strategies of these two measures as well as the possibility to integrate them. The lack of enough data to be analyzed and of institutional capacities in Corinto were the reasons to develop a recommended monitoring scheme for the success analysis of the erosionprevention methods. The Netherlands were used as an example of good practices due to their widely known culture of Integrated Coastal Zone Management.

AB  - Coastal areas are facing increasing pressures, resulting in unprecedented levels of change that require an adaptive and flexible governance system. Through its devolved powers, governance in Wales has undergone significant change, with new legislation providing ‘world-leading’ and ‘innovative’ approaches to a range of social, economic and environmental challenges. This provides an opportunity to examine the extent to which ecosystem services have been translated into national policy, providing a useful case study for global coastal governance. This paper reviews five recent Welsh acts, focusing specifically on the case study system of saltmarshes and their ecosystem services, benefits and processes. A number of themes are identified, highlighting opportunities and challenges for global coastal governance. One key observation found that the language used within these 5 Acts is more clearly linked to ecosystem benefits, rather than language traditionally associated with ecosystem services. This evaluation of these Acts highlighted a limited inclusion of ecosystem services – perhaps, if ecosystem services are to be the lynchpin of coastal governance, a more explicit consideration of the concept is required at the highest of policy scales. Finally, recommendations are presented calling for greater inclusion of ecosystem services within high-level policy, and for an integrated and adaptive approach to coastal governance. In addition, it should be noted that although the study is based in a Welsh context, the outcomes are framed within a global scale, providing transferable insights. This paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue surrounding the concept of ecosystem services and its application within coastal governance.

AB  - Coastal areas are especially vulnerable to habitat loss, sea-level rise, and other climate change effects. Oyster-dominated eco-engineered reefs have been promoted as integral components of engineered habitats enhancing coastal resilience through provision of numerous ecological, morphological, and socio-economic services. However, the assessed ‘success’ of these eco-engineered oyster reefs remains variable across projects and locations, with their general efficacy in promoting coastal resilience, along with related services, often mixed at best. Understanding factors influencing the success of these eco-engineered habitats as valuable coastal management tools could greatly inform related future efforts. Here, we review past studies incorporating reef-building oysters for coastal resilience and enhanced ecosystem services. Our aims are to better understand their utility and limitations, along with critical knowledge gaps to better advance future applicability. Success depends largely on site selection, informed by physical, chemical and biological factors, and adjacent habitats and bottom types. Better understanding of oyster metapopulation dynamics, tolerance and adaptation to changing conditions, and interactions with adjacent habitats will help to better identify suitable locations, and design more effective eco-engineered reefs. These eco-engineered reefs provide a useful tool to assist in developing coastal resilience in the face of climate change and sea level rise.

AB  - Coastal areas are characterized by a high level of risk because of its intrinsic vulnerability to the sea action and the high number of socio-economic activities as well as of marine habitats. Traditional methodologies for the design of coastal defences cannot be applied straightforward in the presence of the effects of climate change because of the need to take into account the non-stationarity of natural processes. A novel approach based on an integrated coastal zone management is required to counteract the main consequences of global warming effects in coastal areas (i.e. sea level rise and the increase in frequency and magnitude of extreme events). In particular, besides institutional measures and preparedness and prevention actions, also structural intervention should be implemented. First of all, the upgrade of existing coastal defence structures should be considered, where this strategy is technically and economically feasible. In addition, it is suggested the realisation of Nature-Based Solutions, which consist on using natural processes to create a resilient system. Finally, the integration of traditional and innovative techniques for the design of coastal defences to realise resilient or, even better, antifragile systems is the most preferable approach. Indeed, perfect knowledge of future conditions is not needed for the design of antifragile systems, since this kind of structures are able to improve themselves when hit by unexpected events.

AB  - Coastal areas and coastal communities are facing threats due to the impacts of climate change. Therefore, assessing their vulnerabilities and the potential for natural habitats to contribute to protecting coastal areas and communities is essential for effective long-term planning, sustainability, and resilient coastal management. This study modeled and mapped coastal vulnerability using the InVEST 3.9.1 model developed by the Natural Capital Project Coastal Vulnerability model to explore the role of natural habitats in mitigating coastal hazards in Southern Al Sharqiya and Al Wusta Governorates of the Sultanate of Oman. The results showed that the highest hazard classification > 2.67 represented 18% of the coastal distribution, the intermediate hazard classification ranging between 2.31 and 2.66 represented 38% of the coastal distribution, and the lowest hazard classification ranging between 1.22 and 2.30) represented 44% of the coastal distribution. These results, however, did not account for the role of natural habitats in coastal protection. In terms of the role of natural habitats in mitigating coastal hazards, the presence of natural habitats reduced the extent of the highest exposed shoreline by 14% and 8% for the highest and intermediate areas, respectively. Under the natural habitat’s scenario, the habitats could provide 59% protection for the coastal communities under the highest exposure category and 41% under the intermediate category. Under a no-habitat scenario, about 75% of the coastal communities are exposed and vulnerable to coastal hazards under the highest hazard exposure category and 25% under the intermediate category. These results demonstrate that it is critical, especially for policymakers, to enhance the protection of coastal ecosystems to achieve coastal resilience. This study buttresses the importance of coastal ecosystem assessments in ensuring coastal resilience and climate change adaptation processes for any coastal countries.

AB  - Coastal area constitutes a vulnerable environment and requires special attention to preserve ecosystems and human activities therein. To this aim, many studies have been devoted both in past and recent years to analyzing the main factors affecting coastal vulnerability and susceptibility. Among the most used approaches, the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) accounts for all relevant variables that characterize the coastal environment dealing with: (i) forcing actions (waves, tidal range, sea-level rise, etc.), (ii) morphological characteristics (geomorphology, foreshore slope, dune features, etc.), (iii) socio-economic, ecological and cultural aspects (tourism activities, natural habitats, etc.). Each variable is evaluated at each portion of the investigated coast, and associated with a vulnerability level which usually ranges from 1 (very low vulnerability), to 5 (very high vulnerability). Following a susceptibility/vulnerability analysis of a coastal stretch, specific strategies must be chosen and implemented to favor coastal resilience and adaptation, spanning from hard solutions (e.g., groins, breakwaters, etc.) to soft solutions (e.g., beach and dune nourishment projects), to the relocation option and the establishment of accommodation strategies (e.g., emergency preparedness).

AB  - Coastal and riverine communities, with anthropogenic congestion and natural and economic resources, are vulnerable to climate change impacts including rising sea levels and increasing severity and frequency of storms. Coastal habitats are being increasingly recognized as natural infrastructure that provides resiliency against these stressors. However, few studies have analyzed coastal vulnerability at landscape scale with finely resolved spatial data that account for habitats and demographics. The purpose of this study is to map the coastal vulnerability of the St. Johns River and adjacent Northeastern Florida Atlantic shoreline within the St. Johns River Water Management District. Unique to this study is that natural habitats, different sea level rise scenarios, and human demographics are considered. Specifically, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) 3.9.0 coastal vulnerability model with seven metrics (geomorphology, relief, natural habitats, sea level change, wave exposure, wind exposure, and surge potential) was used to create a coastal exposure index for shore points. Results showed vulnerability to erosion and flooding. Using three sea level rise scenarios (current, 2050 Intermediate-High, and 2100 Intermediate-High), it was found that (1) the coastal exposure indexes and habitat role values were spatially correlated; (2) rising sea levels increased the coastal exposure index and the role of habitats in providing protection; (3) vulnerability of population density and population below poverty density increased with higher sea levels and without habitats present; and (4) low vulnerability areas had high concentrations of mangroves. These results could be used to help prioritize which habitat types and where habitat protection and/or restoration is most needed for protecting shorelines and disadvantaged people. This type of coastal vulnerability study could aid resiliency planning efforts in Northeastern Florida and could be expanded upon for other socioeconomic, infrastructure, or ecosystem queries.

AB  - Climate-related hazards, more specifically droughts, floods and storms, cause the largest share of people affected by disasters and major economic losses. While social and economic disaster-related losses are monitored and documented, this is not well established for the environmental losses. It is well known that environmental degradation is a key driver of disaster risk. As such, healthy ecosystems are acknowledged to contribute to disaster risk reduction (DRR) through their ecosystem services (ES). Yet they are at the same time heavily affected by disasters. Disaster-related losses of ecosystems and their services as well as the implication on overall DRR are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, this research builds on a structured review of peer-reviewed literature and Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNAs) to generate scientific evidence of disaster-related losses of ecosystems and ES to the climate-related hazards droughts, floods and storms. The established database of disaster-related losses of ecosystems provided the basis to further explore the link between disaster-related losses of ecosystems and related losses of ES. An additional review of scientific literature delivered evidence that losses of ES are many times higher than documented so far. In order to better understand, how disaster-related losses of ecosystems and ES ultimately alter disaster risk, we showcase the link between disaster-related losses of ecosystems and their services against the three dimensions of disaster risk. Regulating ES reduce disaster risk through mitigating hazard and exposure. Provisioning, regulating, habitat and cultural ES help to reduce vulnerability. Disasters diminish the capacity of ecosystems to provide ES, which leads to increasing disaster risk. We conclude this research with three constructive recommendations for integrating disaster-related losses of ecosystems and ES in a more comprehensive manner into disaster risk monitoring – notably the monitoring structure of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The aim of these recommendations is to support a more comprehensive monitoring of disaster-related losses including the environmental dimension and better acknowledge the role and contribution of ecosystems for advancing DRR.

AB  - Climate-induced natural disasters such as floods and storms are expected to become more frequent and intense in the coming years. From 2017 till 2020, a pilot project was set up where mussel reefs were established as a nature-based solution to mitigate coastal erosion off the Belgian Coast. These subtidal mussel reefs were created by applying a longline mussel aquaculture technique consisting of filamentous and non-filamentous dropper lines of different materials. In this study, several biological aspects of the Nature-based Solution (NbS) set-up were examined: the suitability of the set-up as a whole, the suitability of the seven dropper line types, distribution of biofouling organism on the dropper lines and the spatio-temporal evolution of the mussel reef and its impact on the underlying benthic communities. Only during the summer months, a mussel reef could be established under the dropper line structure. Filamentous and non-filamentous dropper lines harbored different mussel densities and sizes, leading to a possible different effect on the underlying mussel reef. The biofouling community on the dropper lines was also defined in this study with amphipod species such as Jassa sp. and Monocorophium sp. as the dominant species. The impact of the NbS set-up on the macrofaunal communities remained low for the study period. First indications of a shift towards a less diverse and oligochaete dominated community was observed, although longer time series and an optimized sampling protocol will be needed. This pilot study showed the application of using a mussel longline technique in order to establish a subtidal mussel reef in a soft-sediment environment.

AB  - Climate-driven changes in the central south Pacific Ocean will cause widespread warming of ocean waters, altered circulation, increased stratification of the water column and limited nutrient supply to the surface, decreasing dissolved oxygen, ocean acidification and rising sea levels. These changes will impact marine and terrestrial ecosystems and the communities they support. Ultimately, important sectors, such as fisheries and tourism, will be affected by these changes, as will food and water security and essential services, such as energy, transport of goods and coastal protection. Coral reefs are unlikely to experience significant heat stress, but should they be impacted by changes in sea temperature, including cold water intrusion, their recovery appears challenging due to the islands’ isolation and therefore the low supply of healthy coral larvae from other reef systems. By the end of the century, even under low emissions scenarios, acidification conditions in the seawater around the Pitcairn Islands are likely to become marginal for coral calcification. Increasing Sea Surface Temperature (SST), ocean acidification and related changes to oxygen concentrations and stratification are expected to affect the health of coral reefs that support coastal fisheries in the Pitcairn Islands, and reduce productivity. Pelagic tuna fisheries are also expected to be affected by climate change with a slight increase in biomass for all tuna species projected for this part of the central south Pacific Ocean. Rising sea levels, storm surges, severe storm events and heavy rains will impact infrastructure networks on Pitcairn Island and the safe transport of goods via shipping to the island. Integrating climate change considerations into existing and new infrastructure is essential for building resilience to future climate change impacts. Downscaled projections for the Pitcairn Islands (at a relevant scale) will be particularly important for SST, since it is postulated that coral reefs and marine species may be buffered from regional increasing SST due to circulation patterns. This dynamic needs to be examined further to determine if it is in fact occurring or likely to occur, and therefore improve understanding on the potential impacts of increasing SST on marine ecosystems.

AB  - Climate-change related impacts, notably coastal erosion, inundation and flooding from sea level rise and storms, will increase in the coming decades enhancing the risks for coastal populations. Further recourse to coastal armoring and other engineered defenses to address risk reduction will exacerbate threats to coastal ecosystems. Alternatively, protection services provided by healthy ecosystems is emerging as a key element in climate adaptation and disaster risk management. I examined two distinct approaches to coastal defense on the base of their ecological and ecosystem conservation values. First, I analyzed the role of coastal ecosystems in providing services for hazard risk reduction. The value in wave attenuation of coral reefs was quantitatively demonstrated using a meta-analysis approach. Results indicate that coral reefs can provide wave attenuation comparable to hard engineering artificial defenses and at lower costs. Conservation and restoration of existing coral reefs are cost-effective management options for disaster risk reduction. Second, I evaluated the possibility to enhance the ecological value of artificial coastal defense structures (CDS) as habitats for marine communities. I documented the suitability of CDS to support native, ecologically relevant, habitat-forming canopy algae exploring the feasibility of enhancing CDS ecological value by promoting the growth of desired species. Juveniles of Cystoseira barbata can be successfully transplanted at both natural and artificial habitats and not affected by lack of surrounding adult algal individuals nor by substratum orientation. Transplantation success was limited by biotic disturbance from macrograzers on CDS compared to natural habitats. Future work should explore the reasons behind the different ecological functioning of artificial and natural habitats unraveling the factors and mechanisms that cause it. The comprehension of the functioning of systems associated with artificial habitats is the key to allow environmental managers to identify proper mitigation options and to forecast the impact of alternative coastal development plans.

AB  - Climate related risks generate significant economic, social and humanitarian losses, rising in 2018 to US$ 160bn for overall losses and US$ 80bn for insured losses (Löw 2019). In a 2 ◦C degree warmer world, the climatic risks are highly likely to increase and thus, the losses associated with those risks (e.g. decrease in crop production due to low rainfall and the inherent eurers are considering insurance value of NB conomic losses) (Masson-Delmotte et al 2018). In France, climate risk related insured losses are expected to raise up to 50%. Caisse Centrale de R´eassurance estimates that climate related risks will be responsible for a rise of 35% of average annual losses and 15% due to concentration of assets in risk-prone areas (Moncoulon et al 2016). Because economic and human losses might increase in a changing climate, the question of insurability of risks and affordability of insurance become key. High risks might become uninsurable and the costs of insurance contracts might upsurge. Simultaneously, the protection gap, the discrepancy between economic losses and the claims covered by insurance, has increased. The economic growth of developing and developed countries has boosted the emergence of insurance policies as well as the rise of insured values (Staib and Puttaiah 2018). The resilience of our societies to both frequent and extreme events require to close the protection gap through strong risk transfer mechanisms. The threats of climate change can lead to opportunities by the (re)insurance sector through their involvement into nature-based loss prevention for climate change adaptation (CCA). The opportunities are framed within the sustainable flywheel business model for the (re)insurance future (figure 1). The flywheel is a virtuous circle that leverages on (re)insurers’ risk modelling expertise to increase knowledge on the consequences of climate change on hazards and on nature-based solutions (NBS). This will maintain affordability of insurance by limiting increasing damage and the industry further participates in investments and partnerships for loss prevention.

AB  - Climate policies often provide benefits that are additional to the policy’s primary goal. Ancillary benefits have been extensively analysed for climate mitigation, while less attention has been paid to the co-benefits of adaptation. The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of the potential ancillary benefits of adaptation policies, from an economic, social and environmental perspective. Economic co-benefits of adaptation may arise from reducing the vulnerability to current climate variability, reducing background risk or creating the space for developing new products and services. From a social perspective, the ancillary benefits of adaptation have focused to a great extent on health co-benefits, and from an environmental point of view, these arise mainly from ecosystem-related adaptation approaches. Co-benefits or ancillary benefits of climate policies can be important in magnitude and may play a significant role in fostering climate policies and increasing their acceptability. However, there is little evidence of the extent to which ancillary benefits are being accounted for when planning for adaptation. If and how co-benefits might be integrated into climate adaptation design would be an interesting and policy-relevant question to address in future research.

AB  - Climate is changing rapidly, and the earth is getting warmer. Until now, there has been no planet B. We need urgent actions and need to come up with steps to prevent the disastrous effects of climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation measures are a few ways. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are one of those measures we can put in the category of mitigation as well as adaptation. IUCN defines NBS as actions to conserve, sustainably manage, and restore natural and modified ecosystems that handle societal concerns effectively, benefiting both people and the environment simultaneously. More research on NBS is conducted in developed countries, while the research is comparatively less in other countries. Developing countries use many innovative techniques that are not considered NBS due to limited research. This thesis discusses Nature-Based Solutions and studies from Asian and European countries. By analysing different case studies, it explores if the NBS in Asian countries are more or less effective than in European countries. It uses a mixed methodology approach adapted from the IUCN Global Standard for NBS and the Think Nature handbook (its development was funded by EU Horizon 2020). An essential aspect of NBS is the participation of different stakeholders. To better understand public participation, with the help of the Start Park approach, a workshop was conducted with the students of Politecnico di Torino. As a result, students devised different solutions for the given problems and the role of power in decision-making was understood. There is no precise answer to the research question, but many informative results came up. Developed countries can invest more money in climate change-related practices than others. However, some countries use innovative NBS, which are cost-effective, and which will significantly benefit other places if used. In different continents, solutions perform differently to fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and solve societal problems compared to the solutions when observed in the same continent. This difference depends on the country's primary goal - to prevent climate change or poverty.

AB  - Climate impacts increase with higher warming and evidence is mounting that impacts increase strongly above 1.5°C. Therefore, adaptation needs also rise substantially at higher warming levels. Further, limits to adaptation will be reached above 1.5°C and loss and damage will be inferred. Coastal Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have arisen as popular adaptation options, particularly for coastal developing economies and Small Island Developing States (SIDS), because of their lower overall costs compared to traditional grey infrastructure approaches such as seawalls and levees; their economic co-benefits through positive effects on sectors such as tourism and fisheries; and a broader desire to shift toward so-called blue economies. Two NbS of particular interest for coastal protection are: 1) coral reefs, which reduce coastal erosion and flooding through wave attenuation; and 2) mangroves, which provide protection from storms, tsunamis and coastal erosion. Although there is international enthusiasm to implement these solutions, there is limited understanding of the future viability of these ecosystems, particularly in their capacities as coastal adaptation service providers, in a warmer world.In this presentation, we highlight how long and with how much coverage coral and mangrove ecosystems can provide coastal protection services for future climate scenarios, using air temperature and sea level rise as climate change indicators. A mathematical model for each ecosystem is developed, based on the physical parameters necessary for the sustainability of these ecosystems. We investigate the protective capabilities of each ecosystem under warming and sea level rise scenarios compatible with: below 1.5°C warming; below 2°C warming; warming based on current global commitments to carbon emissions reductions (3-3.5°C); and with no carbon mitigation (6°C). Results show what temperature and sea level rise values beyond which these ecosystems can no longer provide coastal protective services. These results have also been framed in a temporal window to show when these services may not be feasible, beyond which more costly adaptation measures and/or loss and damage may be incurred.

AB  - Climate change risks to coastal communities may overwhelm current management strategies. The emergence of nature-based solutions could provide alternative approaches for climate adaptation; however, studies on their public acceptability are limited. This research focuses on the human dimensions of nature-based coastal adaptation solutions. The research sought to understand the kind of environmental changes participants were experiencing in their coastal communities of Nova Scotia and what management responses they observed being taken, if any. Online focus groups were held with coastal property owners in Nova Scotia to understand how they assess coastal risks and four approaches to nature-based coastal adaptation: living shorelines, accommodation, retreat, and dyke realignment to make space for wetland restoration. Results revealed ongoing trust in traditional hard-line approaches, but also interest in knowing more about nature-based options. There was general support for living shorelines, albeit with scepticism; a concern that accommodation is just a “band-aid” approach; resistance to retreat, despite general recognition of its future utility; and a lack of understanding of dyke realignment. The successful implementation of nature-based coastal adaptation approaches will require more evidence of their viability, better options for financing them, and engagement with communities around the best-fit alternatives for them.

AB  - Climate change puts under pressure existing and future coastal interventions. Growing threats like sea-level rise and intensity of storms require solutions to be adaptable and resilient. Nature-based solutions have shown to tackle these challenges while providing social, environmental, and economic benefits. The role of vegetation in coastal protection is increasingly recognized. Aquatic vegetation reduces erosion, storm surge, and incoming wave height. Large-scale modeling of waves with spectral wave models such as SWAN is indispensable for the design of coastal structures and the assessment of flood risk. Wave dissipation due to vegetation can be modeled in SWAN as increased bottom friction (implicit modeling) or as an additional dissipation function (explicit modeling). The second assumes that vegetation can be represented as rigid cylinders or plates (canopies) with different properties. While some studies concluded that implicit modeling reproduces the spectral evolution of field measurements more closely, others concluded the opposite. Within the BE-SAFE project, field campaigns measured the spectral energy distribution over salt marshes in the Dutch Wadden Sea during several winter storms. The vegetated foreshore in front of the coastal dike got submerged over 2 m of water during high tide and storm surge. The measurements deployed wave gauges over the study transect, which was defined between the pioneer zone marsh edge and the near-dike location (300 m behind the salt marsh). Calibrating the implicit and explicit models in SWAN brought the modeled total wave energy decay closer to the measurement. Nevertheless, the spectral shape, which describes the energy distribution over frequencies, still showed significant and not yet understood differences near the dike. A methodology was executed to investigate the mechanisms that could reduce the spectral mismatch between the SWAN wave model and measurements over vegetation. First, the literature highlighted possible mechanisms that could be incorporated for this purpose. Next, a new frequency-distributed explicit dissipation model of Jacobsen et al. (2019) was implemented in SWAN and compared to implicit and explicit models using lab and field measurements. The results showed that the newly implemented model accurately captures the physics and the change of spectral shapes for all experimentally tested wave conditions and submergences. In contrast, the existing implicit and explicit dissipation models in SWAN reproduce the spectral evolution only under certain circumstances. In the validation and comparison to the field measurements with a much larger water depth than the vegetation height, the model of Jacobsen et al. (2019) correctly captured the vegetation's physical representation and the dissipation on the wind-sea frequencies. Nevertheless, the amount of energy on low frequencies was largely underpredicted by all frequency-distributed models. Therefore, the model of Jacobsen et al. (2019) was modified to include flexibility in a frequency-dependent reduction factor that reproduced the energy decay of the measurements in all frequency regions. Other mechanisms that could be responsible for the mismatch before and over the marsh are the redistribution of energy by non-linear triad interactions, generation of infra-gravity waves, and near-shore currents caused by horizontal variations on the vegetation properties. The present research provides the range of conditions in which the tested explicit and implicit energy dissipation functions in SWAN are able to simulate the spectral evolution over rigid canopies and flexible salt-marsh vegetation. A new version of SWAN includes a new frequency-distributed explicit model that performed more accurately than existing models for rigid canopies. The physical insights from the research contributed to developing additional versions of SWAN, which performed closely to the energy distribution of the measurements over deeply submerged and flexible salt marsh vegetation species.

AB  - Climate change puts the edge between land and sea in sharp relief; sea level rise is essentially a condition of drifting littoral edges. As rising seas threaten to encroach on land-based territories, cities and nations have responded by attempting to fix the edge at a moment in time, blocking the sea’s insidious creep. Atolls formed by coral reefs are mobile, living geographies, which resist attempts to harden their perimeter through structures such as seawalls. We explore how ideas and imaginaries associated with the “edge” between sea and land in the atoll-nation of Tuvalu illustrate competing “riskscapes” and objectives associated with the actors involved. This essay explores this interplay between politics, aid, technocratic solutions, media representations, global aspirations, local ambitions, and climate risk in Tuvalu through an examination of past/future seawalls and other proposals (realized and unrealized) for controlling atoll edges. Through the cases, we seek to re-politicize the edge, unpacking the difficulties surrounding adaptation issues in small-island states, and explore alternative models of “resilient edges” for atoll-dwellers living with climate changes.

AB  - Climate change poses significant threats to wellbeing and livelihoods of people and the ecosystems in many Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Adaptation solutions must counteract these threats while also supporting development in vulnerable SIDS. Suitable options need to ensure that connections between the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of socio-economic systems are defined in a way that can support how decisions are made (and by whom) and how these can impact on other parts of these systems. This is particularly important in many Pacific SIDS, where communities practise customary natural resource management and continue to rely on local natural resources. In this study, we model the anticipated impacts of climate change and the benefits of the ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches on community wellbeing in Vanuatu. To do this, we applied participatory and expert elicitation methods to develop a Bayesian network model, which was designed to evaluate community wellbeing responses at four explicit spatial scales. The model includes both acute and chronic impacts of climate change, the impact of coral bleaching, and the potential loss of Vanuatu’s fringing coral reefs. The model predicts that all proposed EbA interventions will have a positive impact on wellbeing in all four locations to some degree, by either directly improving the integrity of Vanuatu’s ecosystems or by protecting these ecosystems as a positive spill-over of related actions. Significantly, it also predicts that if climate change exceeds 1.5 °C of warming, the costs of achieving the same level of wellbeing are increased.

AB  - Climate change poses severe threats to coastal communities and the ecosystems on which they depend. Warming ocean temperatures increase the magnitude and frequency of storm and coral bleaching events, allowing less time for recovery amidst these threats. Coral reefs complex and stable structure protects against natural hazards by reducing 97% of wave energy, resulting in less coastal flooding onshore. Coral reef restoration is a potentially effective hazard mitigation action to reduce risks to people and property. Traditionally, active coral restoration aims to return coral reef ecosystems to a thriving state, with the goal of increased species and genetic diversity. The same methods can be used to serve as a hazard mitigation strategy in the form of coral reef restoration for risk reduction (CR4). The authors of this report assessed the feasibility of accessing federal hazard mitigation dollars for CR4 by selecting a U.S. coral jurisdiction within FEMA Region 9. They evaluated the technical feasibility, community buy-in, and cost-effectiveness of CR4 projects at 15 sites on Maui, analyzed the flood reduction benefits of coral reefs using FEMA’s Flood Assessment Structure Tool (FAST), and conducted a preliminary benefit-cost analysis. The findings help advance this nature-based solution for use in Hawaii and other coastal communities.

AB  - Climate change poses a variety of threats to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human lives. Mangrove forest is one of the key nature-based solutions that address climate change and its impacts while providing socio-economic and ecological services. With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, various national and local governments are considering mangrove rehabilitation as a natural defense to these threats. This study aims to assess the value of mangrove rehabilitation by focusing on the ecological goods and services it provides as well as the cost of the project at different implementation periods. We apply a real options-based trinomial tree model to evaluate the optimal timing of making an investment decision for the rehabilitation project under uncertainty in climate change damage cost. Validating the model using the Philippines as a case, the results found that the economic benefits from the mangrove forest, including the market value of forestry and fishery products, protection from climate-related damages, carbon sequestration, and ecotourism, exceeded the investment cost for the rehabilitation project. Considering the uncertainty in damage costs from natural disasters, the real option valuation gave a higher total investment value which described a more optimal decision to postpone the implementation of the mangrove rehabilitation. However, the results found conditions in the model to invest immediately when the frequency of natural disasters and their associated damage costs significantly increased. The implications of the results recommend government policies to enable the realization of mangrove rehabilitation as a nature-based solution addressing the Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals, and the Disaster Risk Reduction global agendas of transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies.

AB  - Climate change may reduce the performance and design life of “grey” coastal engineering interventions. Green solutions can be combined with present infrastructures providing extra flexibility to adapt our present beaches with affordable costs. This paper assesses the behaviour of a typology of green solutions (seagrass meadows) via numerical hydro-morphodynamic modelling for an erosive beach prone to episodic flooding, under typical Mediterranean conditions. A multivariate method for jointly assessing flooding and erosion via copulas is proposed and developed. In the considered pilot site, different layouts have been tested by analysing their efficiency and limits. It is concluded that, for moderate SLR rates (RCP 4.5. central trend), these green measures could attenuate efficiently the expected changes in marine drivers. However, the complexity of eco-hydraulic interactions on which the Nature Based Solutions depend would demand periodic monitoring and evaluation for maintaining acceptable risk levels, especially in the case of high-end scenarios.

AB  - Climate change leads to an unequivocal rise in the intensity and frequency of natural disasters. This necessitates mainstreaming of climate adaptation strategies in the global movement on climate action. Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA) has become popular as an effective means of climate adaptation, which can be resilient and flexible compared to hard engineering-based measures. However, ecosystem-based approaches in disaster risk reduction still remain under-researched despite their growing popularity. This study delves into the utility of EBA in the context of the living lab, using a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) based Systematic Literature Review. A living lab (LL) is a participatory tool invented to foster innovation through real-life testing environments, such as individual cities. This study focuses on European coastal regions, as these are both highly populated and vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, storms, flooding and erosion. This study identified multiple synergies between the EBA concepts, living lab and disaster-risk reduction and concludes that EBA schemes can be highly effective in the living lab set-up. It also demonstrates that increased stakeholder engagement and the consideration of socio-economic co-benefits as part of the EBA-LL model can lead to successful disaster risk reduction.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges confronting humanity today. Nature faces the effects of climate change, but it also plays a much broader role in it. Depending on how the world’s ecosystems are managed, they can either contribute to the problem, or provide effective nature-based solutions to solving it. Contributing to the climate problem, the loss and degradation of forests alone currently constitute around 12 per cent of human-caused carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions. The land sector as a whole, including agriculture, forests and other land uses, is responsible for nearly a quarter of global emissions. However, we now know that the avoidance of these emissions through better conservation and land management actions offers a feasible, cost-effective option that is available in the near term. Moreover, restoring degraded lands and enhancing existing ecosystems can help absorb additional CO2 generated from other sectors. It has been estimated, for instance, that restoring 350 million hectares of degraded or deforested landscapes by 2030 could sequester between one and three billion tonnes of CO2 per year while also generating about $170 billion per year in other benefits from ecosystems. Managing nature well can thus make a significant contribution towards global climate mitigation efforts. Nature’s centrality to climate change can also be gauged from the fact that about 60 per cent of cumulative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities since the pre-industrial era have been stored either on land (in plants and soils) or in the ocean. Terrestrial ecosystems store almost three times the amount of carbon found in the atmosphere, while oceans absorb over 25 per cent of annual CO2 emissions. Better conservation, restoration and management of ecosystems – be they forests, wetlands or oceans – play a critical role in the healthy functioning of the carbon cycle and the balanced regulation of the planet’s climate.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most important threats to humanity and it will increasingly challenge the way we manage our development. Stabilising the climate system, as envisaged under the Paris Agreement, demands mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce climate-change impacts and increase the resilience of essential ecosystem services. In the marine environment, the degradation and loss of coastal habitats, particularly ecosystems capturing carbon, is resulting in an unprecedented loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Additionally, pressure on public funding is leading organisations to seek innovative approaches to tackle these challenges and find ways to finance such initiatives and identify opportunities for public-private sector collaboration. In this context, nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation are gaining traction as a no-regrets option. Blue carbon is the carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems. Coastal ecosystems composed of mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows, such as the Posidonia oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean, represent significant carbon sinks. Indeed, they sequester carbon in its organic form and store it for thousands of years. Moreover, coastal “blue carbon” ecosystems provide a wide range of ecosystem services that underpin coastal livelihoods and support adaptation to climate change. However, despite the importance of the ecosystem services provided, these habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate. For all the above, there is a need for a range of incentives and mechanisms to be used to ensure both the reduction of impacts with more sustainable practices and the achievement of conservation goals for these ecosystems. Involvement and leverage from the private sector are crucial to address these challenges. This manual arises from an interest in financing restoration and conservation efforts at European and Mediterranean levels through the sale of blue carbon offset credits. It intends to provide knowledge-based guidance for developing project-based interventions using the carbon finance mechanisms to improve seagrass and coastal wetland conditions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Complementary to this, it can be used for other interventions such as addressing how to robustly quantify blue carbon stocks to identify gains and losses and inform national greenhouse gas inventories. The main target audience for this manual is the range of potential project proponents interested in applying blue carbon values through the development of initiatives to mitigate climate change and support coastal ecosystem management. Among them, relevant ministries and agencies; coastal management practitioners; professionals studying carbon emissions, restoration works or climate change footprints; civil society organisations; researchers; and private sector representatives who may be looking for opportunities to strengthen their corporate social responsibility initiatives.

AB  - Climate change is one factor increasing the risk of hydro-meteorological hazards globally. The use of nature-based solutions (NbS), and more specifically ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction measures (Eco-DRR), has become a popular response for risk reduction that also provides highly-valued co-benefits. Public acceptance is of particular importance for NbS since they often rely on local collaborative implementation, management, and monitoring, as well as long-term protection against competing societal interests. Although public engagement is a common goal of NbS projects, it is rarely carried out with a sufficient understanding of the (de)motivating factors tied to public perceptions. Successful collaboration demands consideration of societal attitudes and values in relation to risk, nature, and place. However, existing research does not sufficiently explore these themes together, their interactions, and their implications for the public acceptance of NbS. This may lead to misaligned public expectations and failed participatory initiatives, while jeopardizing the success of NbS projects and their continued funding and uptake. We conducted citizen surveys within local NbS “host” communities to determine the degree of pro-NbS attitudes and behavior, associated variables, and how these may be leveraged to increase acceptance. We compared results across sites, relying primarily on correlations and regression models along with survey comments and expert knowledge. Three distinct rural NbS being implemented within the OPERANDUM project aim to reduce risk from (socio-)natural hazards in Scotland (landslides and coastal erosion; n = 66 respondents), Finland (eutrophication and algal blooms; n = 204) and Greece (river flooding and water scarcity; n = 84). Our research thus centers on rural NbS for risk reduction within a large EU project. Trust in implementers is a consistent factor for defining attitudes towards the NbS across the sites, and attitudes are strongly associated with respondents’ commitment to nature and behavioral acceptance (i.e., willingness to engage). Behaviorial acceptance is most consistently predicted by connectedness to place and the extent of expected future impacts. Skepticism of NbS effectiveness leads to high public demand for relevant evidence. To increase public acceptance, we recommend greater framing of NbS in relation to place-based values as well as demonstration of the effectiveness of NbS for risk reduction. However, distinct hazard types, proposed NbS, and historical characteristics must be considered for developing strategies aimed at increasing acceptance. An understanding of these characteristics and their interactions leads to evidence-based recommendations for our study sites and for successful NbS deployment in Europe and beyond.

AB  - Climate change is increasing threats to coasts, both from storm surge and sea level rise. Healthy coral reefs provide reduction in storm surges, wave energy, coastal flooding and everyday erosion, and are found across a variety of spatial scales. Given the state of coral reefs worldwide, active Coral Reef Restoration (CRR) in emerging as a necessary component of coastal protection. CRR can be classified as a nature-based solutions (NbS) for coastal protection that also provides a multitude of ecosystem-based services to both humans and other life. Nearly all literature on coral restoration efforts assume a steady-state of human-ecological interactions, but the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and the resulting global disruption has shown that this steady-state is not guaranteed. This study aimed to examine CRR operations and coral reef ecosystems in the context of COVID-19 in the Tropical West Atlantic (TWA). Three research questions were posited to guide this research: 1) How is the COVID-19 pandemic directly and indirectly impacting coral reef restoration work in the TWA?; 2) How is the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacting the vitality of the coral reef ecosystems monitored/restored by TWA CRR programs?; and 3) How can CRR programs be resilient to future global-scale disruptions? To answer these questions, 11 TWA CRR practitioners were surveyed on how their program and the reefs their program serve have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. They were then asked to describe any operational changes their program had made or was planning to make in response to their experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was vii completed online between September 3rd and 14th of 2020. Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in each surveyed country/region as of September 4th, 2020 were also collected. Survey results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted CRR in the TWA. The most indicated causes of disruptions by CRR practitioners fell into the categories of financial lack/uncertainty, lack of reliable workforce, and inability to access field sites. These disruptions were largely driven by government protocols of stay-at-home orders and travel/boating restrictions that impeded CRR workers’ ability to perform regular work. CRR practitioners were also widely disrupted by governmental closing of borders to international travel that vastly diminished tourism and any work travel. Coral reef ecosystem health faired differently from site to site, but four respondents reported a decrease in reef fish populations and fish size. All respondents indicated either implemented or planned operational changes to their CRR program in response to COVID-19, including hiring more local workers, diversifying funding, and developing distance learning workshops. In addition, three possible partnerships between CRR practitioners and civil and environmental engineers (CEEs) were suggested, including remote monitoring of CRR sites and reframing CRR programs as NbS to coastal erosion and storm hazard. While this thesis is a case study of the COVI|D-19 pandemic, its findings have implications beyond this single event. Some of the disrupting factors of this COVID-19 case study are specific to a pandemic event. However, many of the other disrupting factors - such as decreases in tourism, inability to access site(s), and financial uncertainty – are likely to occur in other major disruption events, like an economic crisis or a natural disaster. As such, many of the stated adaptation strategies, both of the CRR practitioners and those recommended for viii partnership with CEEs, are important to the overall resilience of CRR programs in the face of any major disrupting event.

AB  - Climate change is increasing the threat of erosion and flooding along coastlines globally. Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures. Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to artificial structures. This research needs to happen now as our rapidly changing climate requires new and innovative solutions to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to an increasingly uncertain future.

AB  - Climate change is impacting marine seascapes against a backdrop of multiple anthropogenic stressors. These current impacts are projected to increase in the future with increasing warming, acidification, oxygen loss, and sea level rise. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established to protect features in the ocean, traditionally with a focus to reduce fishing pressures and infrastructure placements. These MPAs are static in nature and are rarely considering climate change; therefore, their potential adaptation effectiveness as local adaptation measures for conservation in response to climate change are not clear. Here we discuss the challenges to Marine Protected Areas as conservation tools and for adaptation to climate change threats. We use two case studies from the UK to ask how climate change resilience could be included in MPA management to future-proof these conservation measures. We conclude that the resilience of MPAs to climate change would be better supported when adaptive management measures and an ecosystem-based approaches are adopted. We emphasise the need to increase the recognition in the primary legislation of MPAs and the monitoring of sites to better understand climate change as it becomes more pronounced, and impacts emerge.

AB  - Climate change is and will continue altering the world's coasts, which are the most densely populated and economically active areas on earth and home for highly valuable ecosystems. While there is considerable relevant research, in the authors' experience this problem remains challenging for coastal engineering. This paper reviews important challenges in this respect and identifies three key actions to address them: (a) refocusing traditional practice towards more climate-aware approaches; (b) developing more comprehensive risk frameworks that include the multi-dimensionality and non-stationarity of their components and consideration of uncertainty; and (c) building bridges between risk assessment and adaptation theory and practice. We conclude that the way forward includes numerous activities including increased observations; the attribution of coastal impacts to their drivers; enhanced climate projections and their integration into impact models; more impact assessments at the local scale; dynamic projections of spatially-distributed exposure and vulnerability; and the exploration of inherently adaptive options. Given the complexity of the possible solutions, more practical guidance is required.

AB  - Climate change is already resulting in global sea-level rise, and is expected to cause further rises in sea level in the future as the climate continues to warm. The rates and impacts of sea-level rise vary from location to location, being affected by many factors including local sea-level rise rates, land subsidence/uplift rates, and soil accretion/erosion rates in coastal areas. The latter can be significantly affected by changes in land-use or land management practices. This chapter gives an overview of the impacts of sea-level rise, and demonstrates how to perform sea-level rise analysis using the free SLAMM (Sea level affecting marshes model) software. In the chapter, you will learn how to run SLAMM using different land-use and sea-level rise scenarios, and visualize the outputs of the modeling.

These impacts will continue and increase over the short to medium term, even as the community of nations works to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. There is an urgent need to develop, implement, and fund ecosystem-based adaptation strategies in coasts and oceans as a central part of the global response to climate change. Coastal and marine ecosystem protection and restoration is the foundation for ecosystem-based adaptation, and strong and specific provisions for the development, implementation and funding coastal and marine ecosystem-based adaptation need be a central part of a Post-2012 Climate Agreement.

AB  - Climate change is a recognized threat to the well-being and livelihoods of humans and ecosystems across the globe. The impacts of climate change can be subtle or drastic, from the slowly shifting ranges of species to the destruction of property and livelihoods by increasingly frequent extreme weather events. The latest assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that observed changes in the climate system are unprecedented over decades to millennia – the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are leading to ocean acidification (IPCC 2013). The impacts and risks of climate change pose multiple challenges to the global sustainable development agenda. They impede progress on achieving sustainable development and can disproportionately affect vulnerable sectors of society and communities, particularly in least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) (Rio Conventions 2012). Livelihoods in many small island developing States depend on healthy coral reefs, which have the additional function of protecting coasts from storm surges and waves. However, ocean warming and ocean acidification exacerbate other pressures on corals, such as pollution, overexploitation and invasive species, and if current trends continue coral reefs may become one of the first unique ecosystems to reach an irreversible tipping point (IPCC 2013; Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2014).

AB  - Climate change is a reality, and its impact is being experienced all over the globe. The effects range from heat waves, raising sea levels, coastal erosion, flooding, drought, and reduction of bio-diversity among others. Urban areas are at greater risk since they accommodate the majority of the global human population exceeding 55% and are expected to be 68% by 2050. The most affected urban areas are the tropical coastal cities since most of them fall within low and middle-income countries with low levels of economic development and technological capabilities hence a low capacity to adapt. This study focuses on exploring Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) as an affordable and ecologically sustainable approach to enhance climate change adaptability in tropical coastal cities. A case study of Mombasa is considered, a typical tropical coastal city located in Kenya. Primary data sources including pictures and key informant interviews via snowball sampling were employed to gather ground information. Secondary sources consisted of institutional data review, strategic documents, policies, and scientific journals on NBS and Climate Change adaptation in tropical environments. The study findings depicted the climate change associated challenges in Mombasa include urban flooding, rising sea levels, coastal erosion, increasing temperatures. Rapid urbanization related challenges include inadequate infrastructure and services, poor liquid and solid waste management and inadequate housing. The study proposes NBS measures such as coastal vegetation restoration, implementing green infrastructure in the urban area, and creeks restoration could offer multi-dimensional benefits that can be replicated in other tropical coastal cities to enhance sustainability and climate resilience.

AB  - Climate change increases risks to natural and human systems. Green infrastructure (GI) has been increasingly recognized as a promising nature-based solution for climate change adaptation, mitigation, and other societal objectives for sustainable development. Although the climate contribution of GI has been extensively addressed in the literature, the linkages between the climate benefits and associated co-benefits and trade-offs remain unclear. We systematically reviewed the evidence from 141 papers, focusing on their climate benefits, relevant co-benefits and trade-offs, and the GI types that provide such climate (co-)benefits. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the links between climate benefits, co-benefits and types of GI, categorized along a green-grey continuum so that researchers/practitioners can find information according to their topic of interest. We further provide an analysis of trade-offs between various GI benefits. ‘Bundles’ of major co-benefits and trade-offs for each climate benefit can be identified with recommendations for strategies to maximize benefits and minimize trade-offs. To promote climate-resilient pathways through GI, it is crucial for decision-makers to identify opportunities to deliver multiple ecosystem services and benefits while recognizing disservices and trade-offs that need to be avoided or managed.

AB  - Climate change impacts and the ongoing environmental degradation are reducing the resilience and adaptation capacity of European socio-environmental systems. Since the beginning of this century, the role of nature has increasingly been seen as a crucial component to cope with climate change impacts while improving the resilience of ecosystems and society. Enhancing and protecting natural capital and its associated ecosystem services have become the core of action of different national and international development policies. The concept of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) is being emphasised as an opportunity to address biodiversity and climate crisis simultaneously. The critical element differentiating NBS from other adaptation approaches is their capability of producing several benefits simultaneously. This approach highlights the relevance of nature and suggests the adoption of a systematic approach that considers at the same level of importance the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainable development. Despite their potential, several barriers and the short compilation of evidence on NBS effectiveness are limiting the total uptake of the concept into national development policies and adaptation actions. Consequently, the central focus of this research is to explore ways to operationalise the NBS concept for adaptation and sustainable development planning. For that, this dissertation seeks to increase the evidence-based on the long-term effectiveness of NBS for addressing different societal challenges. This research has critically evaluated the NBS concept as well as the main trade-offs in their long-term performance. In this sense, different approaches have been proposed to improve the decision-making process and the adaptation capacity of NBS. The study is divided into four consecutive chapters that explore different aspects relevant to the design and implementation of NBS. Stakeholders engagement and participatory modelling approaches have been the backbone of this research. For this reason, the conceptual and methodological assessment of NBS carried out in this study, has been tested and validated by end-users and stakeholders in two case studies, Copenhagen city and Medina Del Campo Groundwater Body (Spain).

AB  - Climate change has been identified as one of the greatest threats facing our world today. The effects of climate change are expected to increase global sea level rise and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. This poses a significant risk to cities due to their high population density and economic, political, cultural and commercial activities. Coastal cities in low- and middle-income countries are most at risk due to their low adaptive capacity. Global assessments have identified East Africa as one of the most threatened coastal regions. This is because East African cities are undergoing substantial unplanned growth, which increases the exposure of people and assets to climate change impacts. Little research has been conducted on potential adaptation measures to climate change in this region. This thesis assesses the potential for nature-based solutions to be used to mitigate climate change vulnerabilities along the coast of Dar es Salaam, where grey infrastructure solutions have traditionally been used. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to do so. Key informant interviews combined with a geospatial analysis was used to identify vulnerabilities to climate change and locate suitable areas for different nature-based solutions. The results showed that there were suitable areas for nature-based solutions to address adaptation gaps in coastal Dar es Salaam. Mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass and sand dunes were found to be viable options along the coast of Dar es Salaam. This thesis concludes that the use of nature-based solutions can offer relatively inexpensive, effective and long-lasting climate change adaptation solutions that create a range of co-benefits both for coastal ecosystems and for the economic lives of local communities in and around Dar es Salaam’s coastal region. This thesis provides a scientific basis to support evidence-based policy making on sustainable adaptive management in Tanzania, with potential applications in other coastal urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries.

AB  - Climate change and urbanization are increasingly defining the planet yet they are both characterized by inequitable impacts and inadequate responses. Cities are responsible for an estimated 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but much of this is concentrated in the developed world. The need for adaptation is pervasive across cities of every size and climate, especially in the rapidly expanding cities of developing countries given the high levels of vulnerability. Urbanization has enhanced economic development and improved the lives of many people in the past few decades, however basic living conditions still elude millions of urban residents around the world. There are many climate change-related risks—rising sea levels, storm surges, heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coast flooding—for urban areas and they are on the rise. These risks are heightened for those living in informal settlements, lacking adequate housing, basic services, and reliable infrastructure. Responses to climate change and urbanization reveal that there has been a proliferation of global agreements and support generated from the international level, however the capacity, data, and finance at the city level to effectuate change is variable. Solutions vary by city, country, and region. In high income countries, improving urban spaces is critical for reducing global greenhouse emissions and there is great potential for multiple benefits from upgrading urban areas—increased mobility, more reliable energy sources, and reducing vulnerabilities to disaster while transitioning to a low-carbon economy powered by cities. Engaging local communities and adopting ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation in urban and peri-urban areas have further potential to attain sustainable development for cities.

AB  - Climate change and urbanisation in combination put great pressure on terrestrial and ocean ecosystems, vital for subsistence and wellbeing in both rural and urban areas of Pacific islands. Adaptation is urgently required. Nature-based solutions (NbS) offer great potential, with the region increasingly implementing NbS and linked approaches like ecosystem-based adaptation in response. This paper utilises three Pacific island nation case-studies, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu, to review current NbS approaches to adapt and mitigate the converging resilience challenges of climate change and urbanisation. We look at associated government policies, current NbS experience, and offer insights into opportunities for future work with focus on urban areas. These three Pacific island case-studies showcase their rich cultural and biological diversity and, importantly, the role of traditional ecological knowledge in shaping localised, place-based, NbS for climate change adaptation and enhanced wellbeing. But gaps in knowledge, policy, and practice remain. There is great potential for a nature-based urban design agenda positioned within an urban ecosystems framework linked closely to Indigenous understandings of wellbeing.

AB  - Climate change and subsequent human responses have had drastic impacts on salt marshes. Sea level rise, increased storm intensity, and coastal development have caused a 50% loss in wetlands globally in the 20th century. Shoreline hardening has become a popular method to reduce effects from climate change; however, hardening often fails, and the consequences of failure are typically greater than the problems hardening is meant to prevent. The need for alternative, sustainable, and durable shoreline stabilization methods is evident. This paper outlines the creation and testing of an abiotic salt marsh mimic, with the intent of it being a sustainable alternative to shoreline hardening. The mimic was evaluated in terms of fish utilization, wave attenuation, and sediment and nutrient processes. A business model was developed that could be used to market and implement the salt marsh mimic product.

AB  - Climate change and population growth are degrading coastal ecosystems and increasing risks to communities and infrastructure. Reliance on seawalls and other types of hardened shorelines is unsustainable in an era of rising seas, given the costs to build and maintain these structures and their unintended consequences on ecosystems. This is especially true for communities that depend on coastal and marine ecosystems for livelihoods and sustenance. Protecting and restoring coral reefs and coastal forests can be lower cost, sustainable alternatives for shoreline protection. However, decision-makers often lack basic information about where and under what conditions ecosystems reduce risk to coastal hazards and who would benefit. To better understand where to prioritize ecosystems for coastal protection, we assessed risk reduction provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass along the entire coast of The Bahamas, under current and future climate scenarios. Modeled results show that the population most exposed to coastal hazards would more than double with future sea-level rise and more than triple if ecosystems were lost or degraded. We also found that ecosystem-based risk reduction differs across islands due to variation in a suite of ecological, physical, and social variables. On some populated islands, like Grand Bahama and Abaco, habitats provide protection to disproportionately large numbers of people compared to the rest of the country. Risk reduction provided by ecosystems is also evident for several sparsely populated, remote coastal communities, in some cases with large elderly populations. The results from our analyses were critical for engaging policy-makers in discussions about employing natural and nature-based features for coastal resilience. After hurricanes Joaquin and Matthew hit The Bahamas in 2016 and 2017, our assessment of coastal risk reduction and the multiple benefits provided by coastal ecosystems helped pave the way for an innovative loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to the Government of The Bahamas to invest in mangrove restoration for coastal resilience. This work serves as an example for other regions and investors aiming to use assessments of ecosystem services to inform financing of natural and nature-based approaches for coastal resilience and climate adaptation.

AB  - Climate change and current susceptibilities exacerbated the coastal flood loss and damage resulting in livelihoods and property damage. Urban areas in the Low to Lower-Middle Income Countries are expected to be disproportionately impacted by the disaster, given a higher share of citizens living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, limited financial resources, and poorly constructed disaster protection. Documentation of historical coastal floods, population, and property affected, could advance the assessment by considering those parameters in risk analysis. Besides, incorporating such geographic features e.g., mangroves as the ecological solution for alternative coastal flood protection in the prediction is also essential. Mangrove is considered fit for the LLMIC primarily situated in the tropical zone. The prediction utilizing spatial Machine Learning (ML) could aid climate-related disaster risk analysis and contribute to risk reduction and policy suggestions to improve disaster resilience. The research aims to archive recent studies on the application of geospatial science empowering Artificial Intelligence, notably ML in coastal flood risk assessment, so-called GIS-based AI. Another aim is to document population, property, and mangrove distribution across the LLMIC. Artificial Neural Networks were mostly utilized for disaster risk assessment in past research. The number of 58 historical coastal flood events and 908 expected coastal flood hotspots for 2006 to 2021 has been documented. Over 1,2 million Km2 falls under vulnerable areas toward coastal flood in LLMIC under different settlement types where Large City (urban areas) dominates it. Mangrove distribution is mainly distributed across tropical regions mostly distributed along the Southeast Asia coast.

AB  - Climate change and coastal urbanisation are accelerating the demand for protection against erosion and flooding (Kirezci et al., 2020). Rising sea levels and an increased frequency and/or magnitude of storm events has led to growing interest in alternative solutions to grey infrastructure (e.g., seawalls, revetments, dikes) due to unsustainable management costs (Hinkel et al., 2014) and environmental impacts (Bishop et al., 2017; Gittman et al., 2016). Living shorelines that use natural ecosystems either with ("hybrid approach") or without ("soft approach") hard stabilising structures for coastal protection may provide several benefits over traditional grey infrastructure (Bilkovic et al., 2017; Sutton-Grier et al., 2015). Topographically complex coastal ecosystems that include dunes, saltmarshes, mangroves, seagrasses and shellfish and coral reefs provide natural coastal protection through wave attenuation, depth-induced wave breaking, and sediment stabilization (Duarte et al., 2013; Narayan et al., 2016; Walles et al., 2015b). These ecosystems can adapt to changes in climate by growing or accreting at the rate of sea level rise (Rodriguez et al., 2014; Sasmito et al., 2016; Walles et al., 2015a), and self-repair after storm events (Gittman et al., 2014). Living shorelines can also provide multiple co-benefits such as supporting biodiversity and fisheries, water filtration, carbon sequestration, social amenity and cultural value (Guthrie et al., 2022; Moody et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2021; Tachas et al., 2021).

AB  - Climate change and biodiversity loss are deeply intertwined anthropogenic global crises, for which forests provide powerful nature-based solutions. Biodiverse forests are more resilient to climate change than monocultures, thereby enhancing long-term carbon storage and ecosystem-based adaptation. Awareness of these interdependencies is slowly growing, but we know little about how countries are considering biodiversity within climate policies. Island and low-lying coastal states are particularly vulnerable to climate change and biodiversity loss. Here we assessed if and how the members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) are integrating biodiversity into their national climate action plans through forest-based climate solutions. Our analysis shows that these solutions are a missed opportunity for tackling the twin crises together. Only five of the 39 countries explore co-benefits and synergies between forest-based climate solutions and biodiversity conservation measures. An additional nine mention them separately. Among these 14 countries, only a narrow range of interventions were proposed. While 28 AOSIS members prioritised forests for combating climate change, mostly for mitigation, only three prioritised their unique and globally important biodiversity. This omission is potentially risky, since mitigation measures, such as planting rapidly growing non-native trees, can have negative outcomes for biodiversity. Climate action plans must place a greater emphasis on concrete and measurable targets that create synergies with biodiversity conservation, including through the protection of old-growth forests and forest restoration. Our results highlight that forums such as the United Nations Climate Change Conferences need to continue pushing for a stronger integration of biodiversity into climate policies.

AB  - Climate change and associated sea-level rise alongside the potential for alterations in the magnitude and frequency of extreme storm events, rapidly rising coastal populations, and a legacy of coastal land reclamation have led to the consideration of nature-based approaches towards coastal flood and erosion protection over recent years. The descriptions of such approaches highlight the flood protection value of natural coastal features but examples of their implementation remain few and far between and nature-based solutions to the rising coastal flood and erosion risk can certainly not (yet) be considered mainstream. One key problem around the implementation of these types of approaches has, arguably, been the relative lack of perceived scientific certainty, amongst stakeholders, surrounding the efficiency with which natural landforms reduce wave action on landward lying structures and the persistence of such landforms in an uncertain future. This makes nature-inclusive approaches less attractive to more traditional engineering-only approaches that rely solely on one ‘hard’ structure with a well-defined impact on waves and a specified design life. Using existing evidence for the coastal protection function of salt marshes, this paper offers a new perspective on this apparent lack of scientific certainty by offering a ‘no-regret’ application of existing science that allows decision makers and coastal planners to implement nature-inclusive approaches to coastal flood and erosion risk reduction measures with greater confidence.

AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activities are increasingly threatening estuarine and coastal zones. These effects lead to complex positive and negative feedback among sustainable development pillars of human, society, economy and environment according to the integrated sustainability perspective. Only limited studies have calculated comprehensive impact assessments of land conversions between land and sea, invasive species expansion, and inundation impacts on natural wetlands under future scenarios. To fill-in this research gap, this study aims to conduct a long-term temporal analysis (1960–2015) of land use and land cover change (LULC), and future ecosystem service value (ESV) loss for intertidal wetlands predicted in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE). The results show that, over recent decades, impervious constructed areas and Spartina alterniflora-covered saltmarsh have increased to 10.7% and 2.61%, respectively, whereas native species saltmarshes and tidal flats have decreased to 0.04% and 1.1%, respectively. The total ESV increased significantly during 1960–2000 but significantly declined during 2000–2015. The highest total ESV was US$ 3.8 billion in 2010, considering the approximate contributions of natural and artificial wetlands. Similarly, the ESV of the S. alterniflora saltmarshes reached US$ 0.7 billion in 2015. The total intertidal wetlands area could decrease to 8071–8248/ha by 2100. The total ESV of intertidal wetland ecosystems would decrease by approximately one billion dollars between 2015 and 2050. An enhanced understanding of the economic impacts regarding coastal management, restoration, and conservation is of profound importance for improving coastal resilience, sustainable development, and adaptation of coastal societies to climate change in the Yangtze River Estuary.

AB  - Climate buffer infrastructure is on the rise as a promising ‘green’ climate adaptation strategy. More often than not, such infrastructure building is legitimized as an urgent technical intervention—while less attention is paid to the distribution of costs and benefits among the affected population. However, as this article shows, adaptation interventions may directly or indirectly result in the relocation or even eviction of households or communities, thereby increasing vulnerabilities for some while intending to reduce long-term climate vulnerabilities for all. We argue that this raises serious, if underappreciated, ethical issues that need to be more explicitly addressed in adaptation policy making. We illustrate our conceptual argument with the help of three examples of infrastructural ‘climate buffers’: Space for the River projects in the Netherlands, the Diamer–Bhasha dam in Pakistan and the coastal protection plan in Jakarta, Indonesia.

AB  - Climate and ecological emergencies play out acutely in coastal systems with devastating impacts on biodiversity, and the livelihoods of communities and their cultural values. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one of the key management and regulatory tools against biodiversity loss, playing a role in strengthening bio-cultural diversity and sustainability of coastal social-ecological systems. What is unclear though is the effectiveness of static protections under climate change as species move. Next to ecological uncertainty, regulatory uncertainty may play a role in weakening marine conservation. We asked whether MPAs are ecologically effective now and can sustain or improve to be so in the future while facing key climate and regulatory uncertainties. MPAs can support the protection of cultural values and have an impact on activities of sea-users and the sustainability of social-ecological systems. As such, questions surrounding their legitimacy under a changing climate and increased uncertainty are pertinent. We argue that MPA governance must be cognisant of the interdependency between natural and human systems and their joint reaction to climate change impacts based on an integrated, co-developed, and interdisciplinary approach. Focusing on the UK as a case study, we highlight some of the challenges to achieve effective, adaptive and legitimate governance of MPAs. This article is part of the theme issue 'Nurturing resilient marine ecosystems'.

AB  - Cities are high emitters of greenhouse gases and are drivers of environmental modification, often leading to degradation and fragmentation of ecosystems at local and regional scales. Linked to these trends is a growing threat experienced by urban areas: the risk from hydro-meteorological and climatological hazards, further accentuated by climate change. Ecosystems and their services, though often overlooked or degraded, can provide multiple hazard regulating functions such as coastal and surface flood regulation, temperature regulation and erosion control. Engineering or grey approaches often do not tackle the root causes of risk and can increase the vulnerability of populations over the long-term. However, evidence of alternative approaches such as the role of healthy, functioning ecosystems in disaster risk reduction are still scarce, contentious, and with limited applicability in the urban context. This chapter explores the role of grey, green, and blue infrastructure and in particular hybrid approaches for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to shed light on available sustainable adaptation opportunities in cities and urban areas. We highlight the dependence of cities on ecosystems as a key component of climate resilience building through case studies and literature review. At the same time, we highlight the limitation and drawbacks in the adoption of merely grey or merely green infrastructures. We suggest that an intermediate ‘hybrid’ approach, which combines both blue, green and grey approaches, may be the most effective strategy for reducing risk to hazards in the urban context.

AB  - Cities all over the world are edging further into the ocean. Coastal reclamation is a global conservation issue with implications for ocean life, ecosystems, and human well-being. Using Malaysia as a case study, the coastal reclamation trends over three decades (1991–2021) were mapped using Landsat images and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) via the Google Earth Engine platform. The changes in drivers and impacts of these coastal expansions throughout the decades were also reviewed. Twelve out of the 14 states in Malaysia had planned, active, or completed reclamations on their shorelines. Between 1991 and 2021, an absolute area of 82.64 km2 has been or will be reclaimed should all the projects be completed. The most reported driver for coastal expansion in Malaysia is for development and modernization (41 %), followed by rise in human population (20 %), monetary gains from the development of prime land (15 %), and agriculture and aquaculture activities (9 %). Drivers such as reduction of construction costs, financial advantage of prime land, oil and gas, advancement of technology, and tourism (Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H)) had only started occurring within the last decade, while others have been documented since the 1990's. Pollution is the most reported impact (24 %) followed by disruption of livelihoods, sources of income and human well-being (21 %), destruction of natural habitats (17 %), decrease in biodiversity (11 %), changes in landscapes (10 %), erosion / accretion (8 %), threat to tourism industry (6 %), and exposure to wave surges (3 %). Of these, changes in landscape, shoreline alignment, seabed contour, and coastal groundwater, as well as wave surges had only started to surface as impacts in the last two decades. Efforts to protect existing natural coastal and marine ecosystems, restore degraded ones, and fund endeavours that emphasize nature is needed to support sustainable development goals for the benefit of future generations.

AB  - Chapter 17 discusses challenges for financing nature-based solutions (NBS). Financing NBS is a key challenge to ensure scaling of the use of NBS in urban areas. This is mainly due to the difficulty to monetize the value generated through the provisioning of ecosystem services, as well as the multiple cobenefits that NBS provide. Certain types of NBS, such as green roofs, have been able to allow for private value capture, enabling such projects to attract private or blended capital. Others, where benefits are generally regarded as public good, have to rely on different financing strategies and instruments. The section provides an overview of financing solutions (public, private, and blended instruments) for different types of NBS and their applicability to NBS in the urban context.

AB  - Changes in mangrove forest cover (increases and decreases) have been observed globally as a result of the influence of environmental changes and human impacts. Although mangrove forest increases are globally uncommon, in New Zealand mangroves are increasing in distribution at the expense of other intertidal estuarine habitats. This study quantified the change in mangrove area over a period of 74 years (1940–2014), and investigated the influence of land‐based (e.g. land use conversion in the catchments), climatic, and oceanic factors on the change in temperate mangrove forest cover in the Auckland Region of New Zealand over that period. An improved mapping approach using aerial photographs and Landsat images was applied to quantify changes in tall and dwarf mangrove cover, and to identify the mechanism of change (expansion, gap filling, and loss), across 38 estuaries in the Auckland Region, New Zealand. Mangrove area increased from 2313 ha in 1940 to 10 483 ha in 2014 (on average 3.2% yr⁻¹), with higher rates in small estuaries ( 1000 ha). The area of the intertidal mudflat habitat, i.e. potential area for mangrove colonization, has doubled from 14 193 ha in 1974 to 28 764 ha in 2014. The increase in total mangrove area was explained primarily by gap filling followed by expansion. The proportion of expansion‐related increase was predominantly seaward (82%) but mangroves also expanded upstream (16%). Boosted regression tree analysis revealed that catchment forest cover, sea level, and mean annual air temperature explained around 85% of the variation in mangrove area. Periods of catchment forest clearing coincided with gains in mangrove forest area. Dwarf mangroves were more sensitive to changes in sea level, in particular over the past 25 years, when the annual sea‐level rise exceeded the sediment accumulation rates. Catchment land use, especially the clearing of forests, associated with increased sediment supply into estuaries is the strongest driver of mangrove forest gain. Thus, land‐use management is a necessary aspect of the management of New Zealand estuaries to conserve the diversity of estuarine habitats (including mangroves) and the ecosystem services that each habitat provides.

AB  - Change is inherent in coastal systems, which are amongst the most dynamic ones on Earth. Increasing anthropogenic pressure on coastal zones interferes with natural coastal dynamics and can cause ecosystem imbalances that render the zones less stable. Furthermore, human occupation of coastal zones often requires an uncharacteristic degree of stability for these inherently dynamic coastal systems. Coastal management teams face multifaceted challenges in protecting, rehabilitating and conserving coastal systems. Diverse monitoring schemes and modelling tools have been developed to address these challenges. In this article, we explore various perspectives: the integration of biophysical, ecological and social components; the uncertainties of diverse data sources; and the development of flexible coastal interventions. We propose general criteria and guidance for an Ecosystem-based Management (EbM) to coastal management, which aims primarily at adaptation to global change and uncertainties, and to managing and integrating social aspects and biophysical components based on the flows of energy and matter.

AB  - Change in mangrove extent and condition has potential consequences for social disparity in terms of who can adapt to change in ecosystem services and places perceived important for providing them. Participatory GIS can elicit spatial variation in the importance attached to ecosystem service places, but disaggregated research that can reveal difference over the small spatial extents often covered by mangroves is underdeveloped. Using mixed-methods (quantitative, qualitative and spatial) in a rehabilitated mangrove system in Vietnam, this study assesses if and why perspectives about ecosystem services and their providing places vary among households with different capacities to adapt to mangrove change.Three household groups with different adaptive capacities were characterised using quantitative adaptive capacity indicators, demographic and economic data, and trajectory interviews spanning three decades: accumulating, coping and flexible households Coastal protection was identified as beneficial by all, and sediment, habitat provisioning and food services were also frequently associated with mangroves. Only food was identified significantly more or less by different groups. Spatial hotspots generated for each group by quantifying overlap in places perceived important for providing these four services, revealed greatest difference in locations important for food. Interviews indicated change in the characteristics of mangrove localities and different abilities to adapt to them enabled some households to prosper while others struggled. We consider adaptive capacities that helped temper mangrove change, and who might be most impacted by continuing change. We conclude by identifying ways forward for rehabilitation strategies centred on local people’s differential adaptive capacity and multiple ecosystem service needs.

AB  - Caribbean countries face many challenges to effectively implement and benefit from the blue economy. This study synthesized current available information from the literature about the main blue economy activities in the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to highlight their value in the context of blue economic recovery. This timestamp of data provides a point of comparison to understand the vulnerability of blue economy sectors to external shocks. The top performing sectors prior to the pandemic were shipping and tourism, both of which were significant contributors to the GDP. The other sectors (e.g. fisheries, aquaculture, pharmaceuticals, etc.) in some countries were well established and in others, at a minimum, displayed potential for continued development. To valorize the blue economy in a post pandemic recovery, there are three core areas of opportunity: sustainable resource extraction and production; cultivated economic development; and improved ecosystem economic valuations. Harnessing these opportunities will require a transition from a traditional ocean economy towards a coordinated blue economy, including the adoption of effective governance and sustainability principles, improved social, economic, and environmental valuations, and sustainable financing, as well as a more regional coordinated approach to the management of resources.

AB  - Carbon stored in mangroves is valuable for climate change mitigation. Managing the carbon stored in the mangrove requires an adequate legal framework and an environmental policy. In Cuba, there is little research on the capacity of mangroves to retain carbon and its articulation in environmental policy and management. In the present study, the following research question is raised: Is there a favorable context in the environmental policy to manage the mangrove as a carbon reservoir in Cuba? The aim of this research is to identify aspects of environmental policy, legal and administrative frameworks related to managing mangroves as a carbon sink in Cuba. The qualitative method of social research, the content analysis technique, and the modified Ibero-American Network for Integrated Coastal Management (IBERMAR) decalogue were used to compile, understand, and discuss the potential for effective management of mangroves for carbon storage. One hundred and twenty-one articles published in WOS and Scopus databases between 2019 and 2022, as well as books and material reviewed on the official websites, were checked. Present policy in Cuba manages mangroves for coastal protection and other ecosystem services but lacks a developed plan for considering the role of this marine forest system as a carbon sink. Managing mangroves as a carbon reservoir will require vigorous efforts to measure and monitor the system. It is necessary to build a robust national political agenda and strengthen institutional and regulatory capacities. This research provides a systematization of environmental policy as a baseline for the management of carbon reservoirs in mangroves in Cuba.

AB  - Cabo Verde (CV) is a small island developing state with many challenges, mainly societal ones based on the natural environment. Despite some advances, environmental sustainability is among the lowest according to the World Bank’s analysis. Environmental vulnerabilities become even more intensified with climate change, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where the natural resource-based economy and tourism are harder to recover. Furthermore, the preservation and management of ecosystems have been deficient, putting pressure on environmental services such as food, environmental quality, biodiversity, and water security. This chapter suggests that the best approach for CV to meet some challenges of the past, present, and future and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals will be through Nature-based solutions (NbS) to complement technological solutions. NbS, such as, Protection of Wild Genetic Resources, Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR), Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), Ecosystem protection approaches (EPA), Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and Ecological Engineering Forest (EE), will lead to the improvement of fundamental pillars in the sustainable development of CV not only based on monitoring, surveillance and awareness activities, but fundamentally by actions to achieve co-benefits (Natural Environment and Human Well-Being) in which actions are based on education and scientific development.Art Performance KeywordsNbS approachesEnvironmental educationSIDSTropical dry islandsSocietal challengesSustainable development

AB  - By the latter part of the twenty-first century, the globe and all societies present will be faced with compelling environmental and climatic circumstances requiring hard choices and tradeoffs to maintain standards of living and viable environmental conditions. One opportunity to shift this reality is through greater understanding of the services and benefits provided by ecosystems as a cost effective means of regulating the impacts of natural disasters and climatic change. This will require broad, collaborative exploration of the science, policy, economics, and funding needed to mainstream the use of nature-based solutions via ecological engineering and design. Clearly there is unprecedented global interest and demand for resilience to disasters and climate change that recognizes the contribution ecosystems can and are making to reduce risk at all scales. The comprehensive overview, conceptual framework, recommendations, and supportive case studies presented herein are intended to move the emerging field of ecological engineering and design forward as an imperative for humanity.

AB  - By the later part of the 21st Century, our planet will be faced with compelling climatic circumstances requiring tradeoffs to maintain viable environmental conditions and standards of living. The prognosis for people near coastlines and waterways is particularly dire without decisive actions that capitalize on shared strengths such as ecosystems. One clear opportunity is the regenerative services and co-benefits of natural infrastructure that reduce the impacts of environmental disasters as magnified by climatic change. Certainly, nature-based solutions are increasingly being viewed as critical actions to reduce societal risk. However, to advance the use of natural infrastructure through eco-engineering, there is a need to clarify the science regarding risk reduction effectiveness, develop agreeable principles, standards, and designs, and grow a demonstration site network responsive to circumstances faced by communities around the globe. In addition, there is a need to consider the legal, policy, and regulatory obstacles and opportunities for natural infrastructure within local to national contexts (i.e., science-based building codes, architectural design criteria, incentive policies, etc.). Ultimately, the integration of science, designs, and policy coupled with installation within several global resource management processes (IWRM, ICZM, etc.) will help establish eco-engineering standards. Supportive coastal, river, and urban examples from around the world are used to illustrate the current state of knowledge, model this integration of science, design, and policy, serve as initial “benchmark site”, and finally help define guiding principles for the emerging field of eco-engineering.

Most of these projects are regional or local in nature and are implemented on a smaller scale. Larger scale projects are more rare. The aim of this article is to highlight a number of large-scale projects that have been completed or are in the developing stage. The focus will be on coastal regions, from temperate locations in the Netherlands and from developing countries in the tropics including Bangladesh. The value of implementing the principle of BwN for a sustainable future is underlined and described. Certain aspects of governance are highlighted to point out the differences and challenges, but also similarities, of carrying out such projects in different parts of the world.

AB  - Building resilience in all forms, including resilience to water-mediated disasters, is imperative for achieving sustainable development. Recognition of role of wetlands in buffering water-mediated risks can diversify disaster risk reduction options as well as contribute to building community as well as ecological resilience. The synergies between international and national policies related to environment, DRR and climate change policy needs to be gainfully utilized to promote higher investment and programming support to initiatives for conservation of wetlands for reducing disaster risk in India. An enabling environment can be created by prioritizing wetlands considering their functions within landscapes, developing and piloting tools linking wetlands functions within hazard-capacity-vulnerability assessments, and creating opportunities of cross-representation within organizations mandated with wetlands and DRR sectors. Oversimplification of the role of wetlands in buffering water-mediated risks will be counter-productive to this agenda. Rather than a polarized policy-making which considers either hard-engineering or nature-based solutions, wetlands should be made a part of portfolios of built and natural capital within a landscape (such as river basin), considering likely outcomes for multiple goals, such as poverty reduction, water-food-energy security, disaster risk reduction, biodiversity conservation and climate resilience, in equitable, efficient and economically and socially viable terms.

AB  - Both natural and anthropogenic forces could play significant roles in coastal erosion in Western Taiwan and Central Vietnam's coastlines. Intensive socio-economic development, sea level rise, more frequent and strong intensity of disasters are predicted to occur in a future of global climate change, which poses an urgent need for coastal hazard management strategies. This chapter describes main causes and discusses the applied engineering interventions to reduce coastal erosion at these sites. Hard engineering structures are often constructed in these areas, but they seem to be merely short-term costly solutions and have a negative impact on the coastal environment and its residents. Nature-based solutions and soft engineering approaches are proposed, which seem to be sustainable and less expensive than hard engineering options. These possible future solutions can be applied in coastal settings to meet the principles of sustainable and humanitarian engineering with multiple benefits to reduce the risk and negative impacts on both humans and the environment.

AB  - Both freshwater and marine ecosystems are degraded by pollution from nutrients, suspended solids, pathogens, siltation, oxygen-depleting substances, metals and organic contaminants. Natural wetlands play a significant role in reducing adverse impacts on water quality associated with pollution, and decrease the need for costly infrastructure. Constructed or restored wetlands also contribute to the abatement of pollution, which is consistent with the emerging paradigm of Nature-based Solutions (NbS). Through a series of case histories, the readers will gain an understanding of the opportunities, as well as the challenges associated with constructing or managing wetlands for pollution abatement, wastewater management and adapting to possible climate change impacts, while preserving their biodiversity and ecological functions. The case histories describe experiences with both natural and constructed wetlands, and provide examples from around the world, including wetlands in polar and tropical ecosystems, as well as wetlands located in urban and remote or rural landscapes.

AB  - Blue carbon provides opportunities to mitigate climate change while increasing ecosystem services for coastal communities, including climate change adaptation; however, blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, leading to uncertainties in the future efficacy of these ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), such as wetlands, marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses, warrant increased attention for their abilities to protect life, property, and environments locally and globally. BCEs serve as both buffers reducing coastal hazards and carbon sinks storing ‘blue’ carbon in aquatic plant life and soils. While research exists on BCE functions and benefits, their global diversity necessitates a collection of localized research investigating the unique dynamics and histories of distinct BCEs. The historic degradation of coastal ecosystems proves the need for purposeful, well-informed, sustainable ecosystem management to conserve and restore BCEs. We conducted a systematic literature review to understand the existing body of research on synergies between BCEs and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR). We investigated how prior research employed various research methods, discussed key aspects of sustainable land management, and considered geographic locations and scales. We discovered localized case studies have incredible insights on the efficacy of BCEs along with contextspecific strategies for sustainable ecosystem management. However, as these case studies are not plentiful and are concentrated in North America and Asia, they do not account for the diversity of BCEs. We suggest increased support for localized research on the benefits and implementation of BCEs as EcoDRR measures.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across ~185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141–466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2–3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3–25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9–13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621–1,064) Tg CO2e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to ~3% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

AB  - Biogeomorphic wetlands cover 1% of Earth's surface but store 20% of ecosystem organic carbon. This disproportional share is fueled by high carbon sequestration rates and effective storage in peatlands, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows, which greatly exceed those of oceanic and forest ecosystems. Here, we review how feedbacks between geomorphology and landscape-building vegetation underlie these qualities and how feedback disruption can switch wetlands from carbon sinks into sources. Currently, human activities are driving rapid declines in the area of major carbon-storing wetlands (1% annually). Our findings highlight the urgency to stop through conservation ongoing losses and to reestablish landscape-forming feedbacks through restoration innovations that recover the role of biogeomorphic wetlands as the world's biotic carbon hotspots.

AB  - Biodiversity is a key indicator of ecosystem health and plays an important role in providing the ecosystem services essential for economic development and social well-being. In Ireland, climate change and anthropogenic pressures have resulted in biodiversity loss and habitat degradation, with knock-on effects on the provision of ecosystem services. The aim of this study was to determine how coastal marine biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Republic of Ireland are represented in the scientific literature, news media, and current legislation. A review of the scientific literature revealed limited research related to coastal marine biodiversity and the number of publications was even lower for ecosystem services. To date, the main lines of research on coastal marine biodiversity have been the abundance and community structure of benthic organisms, such as algae and invertebrates, while ecosystem services research has primarily been associated with coastal zone management. Analysis of the news media indicated that coverage of biodiversity and ecosystem services has increased in the last decade but is far lower than that for topics such as climate change. The terms biodiversity and ecosystem services have only been incorporated into Irish legislation in recent years, and mainly correspond to the transposition of European Directives. Despite evidence of the importance of biodiversity for the sustained provision of ecosystem services, important knowledge gaps remain. Here, we examine those gaps and evaluate current efforts towards greater understanding of coastal marine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Biloxi Marsh, located along the shoreline of Eloi Bay in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana has experienced significant shoreline erosion in recent years. The Living Shoreline Demonstration Project, completed in November 2016, constructed three miles of living shoreline structures to attenuate waves and thus combat marsh edge erosion along the shoreline of Eloi Bay. Several types of constructed oyster reef breakwaters were installed for this demonstration project. Due to the experimental nature of these products, available performance characteristics are limited. This research measures wave attenuation across the constructed oyster reef breakwaters using bottom-mounted pressure gauges. Seven pressure gauges were deployed to obtain wave characteristics on the unprotected and protected sides of four types of breakwater structures. The raw pressure data were processed to determine water surface elevations, significant wave heights, and peak wave periods. In addition to the wave gauges, two water level sondes were deployed to record water surface elevations at the site. Topographic and bathymetric surveys were also conducted along cross-shore transects at the wave gauge locations to provide a profile of the shoreline and structures. The wave attenuation and transmission characteristics of the oyster reef breakwaters from the field measurements are presented. A range of transmission coefficients were calculated for each breakwater structure type.

AB  - Between March 2019 and January 2021, Beira, the second largest city in Mozambique, was hit by two severe cyclones and a tropical storm, that resulted in massive infrastructure and crop damage as well as human losses. Cyclone Idai, the first to hit the town in March 2019, is regarded as one of the deadliest cyclones to ever hit the southern hemisphere. The cyclone also had negative impacts on natural ecosystems such as mangroves and sand dunes. Subsequent Tropical Storm Chalane (December 2020) and Tropical Cyclone Eloise (January 2021) exacerbated these impacts, increasing the vulnerability of the citizens of Beira and surrounding districts. The occurrence of these tragic events in such a short period has highlighted the need for the country to rapidly improve its resilience and response capacity for natural disasters. Climate change projections underscore this need, as tropical cyclones, floods and other natural disasters are predicted to be more frequent and intense in the future. These events also exposed the high level of vulnerability of the country’s coastal communities and highlight the need for climate-resilient reconstruction, in terms of hard and green infrastructure as well as social and economic systems.

AB  - Based on the study of 107 inhabited islands of the Maldives, we assess to what extent the level of local human disturbance of the coastal protection services provided by the reef-island system influences the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) to address climate change impacts in atoll contexts. The results show that in 2014–16, 68.2% of the Maldivian islands (classified Type 3) exhibited a significant human-induced undermining of these services, while respectively 7.5% and 20.6% experienced a high (Type 4) and very high (Type 5) level of undermining of these services, whereas hardly any inhabited island shows low levels of undermining (Types 1 and 2). Based on these findings and on our own expertise in atoll environments, we propose a five-pillar adaptation pathway approach for atoll islands: (i) increase ecosystem resilience; (ii) minimise the risk of maladaptation; (iii) facilitate internal relocation; (iv) promote island fortification associated with ground elevation, and (v) support permanent international migration (back-up plan). While the potential for NBS is high for island types 1, 2, and 3 (respectively undisturbed, little disturbed, and moderately disturbed islands), it is nil for island types 4 and 5, where the coastal protection services delivered by the reef-island system are no longer functional. Given that the Maldives Islands are the atoll country exhibiting the highest population densities among atoll countries and territories, our findings indicate that there is still a high potential for NBS in atoll contexts at large.

AB  - Barrier sandspits are biodiverse natural features that regulate the development of lagoon systems and are popular areas for human settlement. Despite many studies on barrier island dynamics, few have investigated the impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) on sandspits. In peri-urban settings, we hypothesised that shoreline environment change would be strongly dependent on contemporary land use decisions, whilst modern engineering capabilities also present new opportunities for working with nature. Our study site in Christchurch, New Zealand, included a unique example of SLR caused by tectonic subsidence and an associated managed retreat initiative. We used a novel scenario modelling approach to evaluate both shorelines simultaneously for 0.25m SLR increments and incorporating open coast sediment supply in 25-year periods. Our key questions addressed the potential impacts of shoreline change on open coast dune and estuarine-coast saltmarsh ecosystems and implications for the role of ‘nature-based’ climate change solutions. The results identify challenges for dune conservation, with a third of the dune system eliminated in the ‘1-m SLR in 100-year’ scenario. The associated exposure of urban areas to natural hazards such as extreme storms and tsunami will likely fuel demand for seawalls unless natural alternatives can be enabled. In contrast, the managed retreat initiative on the backshore presents an opportunity to restart saltmarsh accretion processes seaward of coastal defences with the potential to reverse decades of degradation. Considering both shorelines simultaneously highlights the existence of pinch-points from opposing forces that result in small land volumes above the tidal range. Societal adaptation is delicately poised between the paradigms of resisting or accommodating nature and challenged by the long perimeter and confined nature of the sandspit feature. The use of innovative policy measures in disaster recovery contexts, as highlighted here, may offer a beneficial framework for enabling nature-based solutions to climate change and natural hazards.

AB  - Bangladesh is regarded as one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in South Asia due to its unique geographical location and socio-economic conditions. Natural disasters, changing temperatures, precipitation, and sea level rise have affected agricultural production, infrastructure, and livelihoods in the country. To face these challenges, nature-based solutions (NbS) can address climate change adaptation, protection and management of natural ecosystems, and biodiversity conservation. For example, in Bangladesh, coastal mangroves can protect communities from storm surge and sea level rise, forests in hilly regions can prevent landslides, and green spaces in urban areas can reduce heat stress and promote the well-being of inhabitants. However, effective design, implementation, and upscaling of NbS requires support from national policies and plans. This study reviews relevant Bangladeshi national policies from the past three decades to investigate NbS as a potential framework to address climate change and societal challenges in the country. We systematically analyzed twenty policy documents across three sectors: national development; disaster management and climate change; and environment and forest. Our study found growing emphasis on preservation, protection, and management of natural ecosystems in the national policies. However, our analysis showed that among the twenty policies, nineteen of them have no direct mention of NbS terminology. Instead, the policies include various strategies and terminologies that fall under the NbS umbrella, such as ecosystem-based adaptation, ecosystem services, and green and eco-building. However, these policies are still widely missing specific implementation guidelines, robust financial support, and institutional mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating NbS initiatives in Bangladesh. We recommend several policy actions to facilitate effective and inclusive NbS interventions in Bangladesh: enhance inter-ministry cooperation; develop national funding support; develop a national promotional campaign; pursue evidence-based research and capacity-building activities; and involve youth, marginalized people, and women. These actions can optimize the benefits of NbS to enhance the country’s resilience against climate change and foster sustainable development.

AB  - Bangladesh is one of the most geomorphologically active countries situated within the World's largest basin of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM). The physiographic settings of the southward coastal areas of Bangladesh is completely exposed to the sea posing vulnerability to natural hazards whereas the poor socio-economic condition tends to intensify the impacts of the vulnerability. In addition to that, the contemporary climate change induced vulnerabilities place the coast of Bangladesh as one of the highly affected areas. Therefore, to combat the vulnerabilities to strengthen the resilience of the coastal communities, spatio-temporal dimension of the vulnerability needs to be understood. The study applied RS and GIS techniques with appropriate methodology along with field and secondary data to constitute coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to identify priority intervention areas along the Meghna estuarine coast of Bangladesh which is the first study on Meghna estuary in this kind. The integrated geospatial techniques have been applied to 2470 grids along the Meghna estuarine coast for each of the 9 parameters to rank in a 1 to 5 vulnerability scale. Finally, the cumulative score of ranks of all the parameters have also been scaled to get CVI which shows significant effectiveness in identifying areas (administrative units) with vulnerability intensity. The authors believe that this CVI can be very important decision support tool for the policy makers to sustainably manage the Meghna estuarine coast.

AB  - Bangladesh is identified as an impact hotspot for sea-level rise in multiple studies. However, a range of other factors must be considered including catchment management, socio-economic development and governance quality, as well as delta plain biophysical processes. Taking an integrated assessment approach highlights that to 2050 future changes are more sensitive to human choice/policy intervention than climate change, ecosystem services diminish as a proportion of the economy with time, continuing historic trends and significant poverty persists for some households. Hence under favourable policy decisions, development could transform Bangladesh by 2050 making it less vulnerable to longer-term climate change and subsidence. Beyond 2050, the threats of climate change are much larger, requiring strategic adaptation responses and policy changes that must be initiated now.

AB  - Background and Aims Over the last decade, the importance of plant biomechanical properties in shaping wave dissipation efficiency of marsh vegetation has gained growing attention. Here we provide the first analyses of how biomechanical stem properties vary with seasons and along environmental gradients in coastal and estuarine marshes, which is essential to enable accurate assessments of flood defence value of marsh vegetation. Methods We quantified both spatial and seasonal variation in stem flexibility and breakability for a variety of common marsh vegetation (Spartina anglica, Scirpus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Elymus athericus, Suaeda maritima, Aster tripolium, Saliconia procumbens) distributed along both salinity and inundation gradients. Key Results Increasing salinity tends to induce a shift from species with tall shoots, high flexural stiffness (stem resistance to bending; N mm2) towards species with shorter and more flexible stems. The same trend was found with increasing inundation stress (i.e. decreasing elevation) from the higher part of the low marsh towards the pioneer zone. Stem breakability (the force required to break or fold a stem, N) followed the same pattern of stem stiffness due to the positive relationship between flexural strength (material resistance to flexure, N mm−2) and Young’s bending modulus (material resistance to bending; N mm−2). Shifts in stem stiffness and breakability at the community level were found to relate positively to the variation in canopy height between species, highlighting the concurrence of changes in morphological and biomechanical traits under environmental changes. Compared to the differences between species, within-species variability between sampling locations and between seasons is generally minor. Conclusions Our findings imply that environmental changes may significantly modify wave attenuation capacity of coastal vegetation by inducing species shifts. This emphasizes the need to understand the response of community composition to climate change and human disturbances, when using nature-based flood protection by coastal vegetation as an adaptive response to global change.

AB  - Background and Aims Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport. Methods Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation. Key Results At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 % greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection. Conclusions We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate.

AB  - Australia’s rapid coastal population growth coupled with the increased risk of hazards driven by climate change creates an urgent need to start adaptation planning for the future. The most common solutions for protecting the coast (seawalls, breakwaters) are expensive and non-adaptive (i.e., they need to be rebuilt, upgraded and maintained in response to a changing climate). There is international precedence for the development of nature-based solutions (i.e., the integration of natural habitats such as coastal vegetation and biogenic reefs) as a cost-effective and sustainable approach to shoreline protection from erosion and flooding. The development of nature-based approaches has been supported by large interdisciplinary teams to inform policy and decision-making. Nature-based coastal defence is currently not a tool widely used in Australia. Key to their wider implementation is: (1) improved scientific knowledge; (2) effective governance; and (3) social acceptance. Recently implemented pilot trials need to inform industry-accredited guidelines that can be integrated into coastal management and government policy.

AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments include some of the world's most intact coastal wetlands comprising diverse mangrove, seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems. Although these ecosystems are highly efficient at storing carbon in marine sediments, their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the potential changes resulting from climate impacts, including sea level rise are not well understood. For the first time, we estimated SOC stocks and their drivers within the range of coastal wetlands of GBR catchments using boosted regression trees (i.e. a machine learning approach and ensemble method for modelling the relationship between response and explanatory variables) and identified the potential changes in future stocks due to sea level rise. We found levels of SOC stocks of mangrove and seagrass meadows have different drivers, with climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, showing significant contributions in accounting for variation in SOC stocks in mangroves. In contrast, soil type accounted for most of the variability in seagrass meadows. Total SOC stock in the GBR catchments, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, is approximately 137 Tg C, which represents 9%-13% of Australia's total SOC stock while encompassing only 4%-6% of the total extent of Australian coastal wetlands. In a global context, this could represent 0.5%-1.4% of global SOC stock. Our study suggests that landward migration due to projected sea level rise has the potential to enhance carbon accumulation with total carbon gains between 0.16 and 0.46 Tg C and provides an opportunity for future restoration to enhance blue carbon.

AB  - Atoll societies have adapted their environments and social systems for thousands of years, but the rapid pace of climate change may bring conditions that exceed their adaptive capacities. There is growing interest in the use of 'nature-based solutions' to facilitate the continuation of dignified and meaningful lives on atolls through a changing climate. However, there remains insufficient evidence to conclude that these can make a significant contribution to adaptation on atolls, let alone to develop standards and guidelines for their implementation. A sustained programme of research to clarify the potential of nature-based solutions to support the habitability of atolls is therefore vital. In this paper, we provide a prospectus to guide this research programme: we explain the challenge climate change poses to atoll societies, discuss past and potential future applications of nature-based solutions and outline an agenda for transdisciplinary research to advance knowledge of the efficacy and feasibility of nature-based solutions to sustain the habitability of atolls. This article is part of the theme issue 'Nurturing resilient marine ecosystems'.

AB  - Atoll islands face increasing coastal risks (coastal erosion and marine flooding) due to climate change, especially sea-level rise. To face increasing coastal risks, various adaptation options are considered by atoll countries and territories, including in particular hard protection (preferred option to date), Nature-based Solutions (increasingly used) and island raising (considered a longer-term solution and a potential alternative to international migration, e.g. in the Maldives). Internal relocation within the same atoll island or atoll, which refers to long-term community movement from one threatened island area or island to a safer island area or island, has previously been disregarded by scholars as a potentially relevant climate adaptation strategy. However, in low-lying coastal areas, it offers real potential to address the dual context of increasing climate risks and the shrinking of the solution space. This paper assesses the potential of internal relocation for atolls by applying to Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia, Central Pacific, a two-fold assessment framework questioning its physical relevance (are some islands high enough to host settlements in the future?) and its societal feasibility (are the political-institutional and socio-economic conditions in place? Are people willing to relocate?). The findings show that internal relocation is both relevant and feasible on Rangiroa Atoll and should therefore serve as a pillar to develop robust in situ adaptation pathways in this atoll.

AB  - Atmospheric CO2 is rising globally. Opportunities for reducing this trend include energy sector adjustments and management of both land and ocean resources. Improved management of coastal and oceanic ecosystems is therefore poised to contribute to, and enhance, climate mitigation and adaptation. This report outlines the emergence of blue carbon as a concept for the integration of coastal carbon dynamics into policy and management frameworks and defines blue carbon ecosystems. It also emphasises the importance of marine carbon sequestration and highlights its potential role in climate adaptation. Ireland is estimated to store at least 9.2 Mt of carbon in its saltmarsh and seagrass habitats, which cover an estimated minimum area of 162 km2. Estimates of carbon stocks in potential blue carbon ecosystems such as macroalgae beds are hampered by lack of data on extent, productivity and actual contribution. Irish coastal blue carbon ecosystems and their carbon sequestration capacity are currently threatened by anthropogenic factors such as land reclamation and poor water quality. The possibility of including saltmarsh and seagrass habitats in Ireland’s National Inventory Report on GHG emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and including Ireland’s potential blue carbon ecosystems in Ireland’s Nationally Determined Contributions is highlighted. The critical knowledge gaps and future research priorities are outlined, so that Ireland can advance the pace of scientific discovery whilst harnessing the climate change potential of its coastal and marine environment.

AB  - As the UN Decade of Ecological Restoration begins in 2021, there is a need to reconcile global efforts to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions with local efforts to protect and restore ecosystems. Protecting and restoring nature will be key to helping communities address both the causes and consequences of climate change, yet nature-based solutions are infrequently employed as both mitigation and adaptation measures. Tourism businesses around the world are uniquely placed to employ nature-based solutions within their properties to manage, protect, and restore ecosystems that both draw down emissions and help communities adapt to climate change. Key to this will be imagining a more “regenerative” industry in which the needs of people and nature are valued above profit. Utilizing the IUCN Global Standards for Nature-based Solutions as a basis for survey design, this study assesses 30 tourism operators across the globe to investigate how tourism can be more regenerative for ecosystems and communities by embracing nature-based solutions. The findings indicate five key factors for this shift, including centering community needs, improving ecosystem integrity, embracing diverse and inclusive business models, governing in a transparent and just manner, and enhancing conservation partnerships.

AB  - As the frequency and intensity of storms increase, a growing need exists for resilient shore protection techniques that have both environmental and economic benefits. In addition to producing seafood, aquaculture farms may also provide coastal protection benefits either alone or with other nature-based structures. In this paper, a generalized three-layer frequency dependent theoretical model is derived for random wave attenuation due to presence of biomass within the water column. The biomass can be characterized as submerged, emerged, suspended and floating canopies that can consist of natural aquatic vegetation with potential aquaculture systems of kelp or mussels. The present analytical solutions can reduce to the solutions by Mendez and Losada (2004), Chen and Zhao (2012) and Jacobsen et al. (2019) for submerged rigid aquatic vegetation. The present theoretical model incorporates the motion of these canopies using a cantilever-beam model for slender components and a buoy-on-rope model for elements with concentrated mass and buoyancy. Analytical results are compared with existing laboratory and field datasets for submerged and suspended canopies. The theoretical model was then used (in a case study at a field site in Northeastern US) to investigate the capacity of suspended mussel farms with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to dissipate wave energy during a recent storm event. Compared to a dense SAV meadow in shallower water, the suspended aquaculture farms more effectively attenuate random waves with a smaller peak period and the higher frequency components of wave spectrum. The performance of suspended aquaculture farms is less affected by water level changes due to tides, surge and sea level rise, while the wave attenuation performance of SAV decreases with increasing water level due to decreased wave motion near the sea bed. Incorporating suspended aquaculture farms offshore significantly enhance the coastal protection effectiveness of SAV-based living shorelines and extend the wave attenuation capacity over a wider wave period and water level range. The combination of suspended aquaculture farms and traditional living shorelines provides a more effective nature-based coastal defense strategy than the traditional living shorelines alone.

AB  - As the focus of land-sea interactions, estuarine and coastal ecosystems perform numerous vital ecological service functions, although they are highly vulnerable to various kinds of disturbance, both directly and indirectly related to human activity, that have attracted much recent attention. Critical zone science (CZS) has emerged as a valuable conceptual framework that focuses on quantitative interactions between diverse components of the environment and is able to integrate anthropogenic disturbance with a view to predicting future trajectories of change. However, coastal and estuarine environments appear to have been overlooked in CZS and are notably under-represented, indeed not explicitly represented at all, in the global network of critical zone observatories (CZOs). Even in the wider network of environmental observatories globally, estuarine and coastal wetland ecosystems are only very rarely an explicit focus. Further strengthening of integrated research in coastal and estuarine environments is required, more especially given the threats these ecosystems face due to growing population at the coast and against the background of climate change and sea level rise. The establishment of one or more CZOs, or their functional equivalents, with a strong focus on estuarine and coastal wetlands, should be urgently attended to.

AB  - As the field of public perceptions research continues to grow alongside an increasing recognition of the importance of understanding the complex interactions between society and the natural environment, this needs to consider all types of ecosystem, habitat and species. Although interest in public perceptions towards the global seas and coasts is increasing, the field is dominated by research focused on charismatic environments and species (e.g. coral reefs or marine mammals), and specific activities or human interactions with the seas and/or coasts (e.g. beach use, marine renewable energy). Whilst there has been some research on beaches and sand dunes, this is the first discrete piece of research which evaluates public views on the less ‘attractive’ coastal fringe environments, such as saltmarshes or mudflats, particularly in temperate regions. This paper presents the findings of a national survey (n = 1136) that aimed to understand public awareness and attitudes towards Welsh saltmarshes, and the ecosystem services and benefits derived from such systems. Through the questionnaire, we found limited public awareness, and a high amount of uncertainty, associated with saltmarshes and their societal benefits, indicating a need to foster and enhance current levels of public knowledge and understanding of saltmarshes, and their role within the wider coastal landscape. The influence of a range of respondent characteristics on perceptions. Given the position of salt marshes at the land-sea interface, the myriad of socio-ecological interactions they experience, and ongoing efforts to develop effective complementary marine and land-based planning and management, it is increasingly apparent that understanding public perceptions towards saltmarshes is crucial. This study contributes to the evidence base of public attitudes for the more commonly under-valued coastal fringe environments, such as saltmarshes.

AB  - As the development of large-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) amplifies due to technological progress and a growing demand for renewable energy, associated footprints on the seabed are becoming increasingly common within soft-bottom environments. A large part of the footprint is the scour protection, often consisting of rocks that are positioned on the seabed to prevent erosion. As such, scour protection may resemble a marine rocky reef and could have important ecosystem functions. While acknowledging that OWFs disrupt the marine environment, the aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of scour protection on fish assemblages, relate them to the effects of designated artificial reefs (ARs) and, ultimately, reveal how future scour protection may be tailored to support abundance and diversity of marine species. The results revealed frequent increases in abundances of species associated with hard substrata after the establishment of artificial structures (i.e., both OWFs and ARs) in the marine environment. Literature indicated that scour protection meets the requirements to function as an AR, often providing shelter, nursery, reproduction, and/or feeding opportunities. Using knowledge from AR models, this review suggests methodology for ecological improvements of future scour protections, aiming towards a more successful integration into the marine environment.

AB  - As the artificial defences often required for urban and industrial development, such as seawalls, breakwaters, and bund walls, directly replace natural habitats, they may produce population fragmentation and a disruption of ecological connectivity, compromising the delivery of ecosystem services. Such problems have increasingly been addressed through “Working with Nature” (WwN) techniques, wherein natural features such as species and habitats are included as additional functional components within the design of built infrastructure. There now exists a convincing body of empirical evidence that WwN techniques can enhance the structural integrity of coastal works, and at the same time promote biodiversity and ecosystem services. While these benefits have often been achieved through modification of the hard surfaces of the coastal defence structures themselves, the desired ecological and engineering goals may often demand the creation of new soft substrates from sediment. Here we discuss the design considerations for creating new sediment habitats in the intertidal zone within new coastal infrastructure works. We focus on the sediment control structures required to satisfy the physiological and ecological requirements of seagrass and mangroves - two keystone intertidal species that are common candidates for restoration - and illustrate the concepts by discussing the case study of soft habitat creation within a major multi-commodity port.

AB  - As sea levels rise and the frequency of flooding events increases, so do efforts to stabilize coastal shorelines. Nature‐based solutions to shoreline stabilization (“green” solutions, as opposed to traditional “grey” shoreline hardening) have been increasingly adopted in the Gulf of Mexico and mid‐Atlantic regions of the United States, but they are only beginning to be implemented, documented, and understood in the northeastern United States. This case study contrasts two shoreline stabilization projects directly across from each other on the banks of the Mystic River, Boston Harbor, MA. These two projects, one private and one public, employ a spectrum of green‐grey shoreline stabilization techniques. Originally planned as traditional grey shoreline stabilizations, both projects shifted toward greener solutions due to local environmental group advocacy, highlighting the influence of outside groups as advocates for nature‐based solutions. This study documents the evolution of both projects, highlighting common challenges in permitting and vegetation maintenance, as well as critical differences in project goals, funding sources, and biodiversity impacts.

AB  - As part of the “Designing Resilient Urban Spaces in the Middle East” white paper series, this paper aims to construct the first body of knowledge in this region discussing the potential opportunities associated with nature-based solutions, through innovations inspired by nature in an urban environment. Over the years, landscape architecture, spatial planning and urban design for large cities and smaller towns have witnessed radical changes to accommodate the ever-increasing populations living in the urban spaces. The development of cities and towns have a multi-faceted and complex history. From ancient irrigation systems of the Mohenjodaro and Harappa civilizations in the Indian sub-continent (2200-1900 BCE) and Dujiangyan irrigation channels in Sichuan, China (256 BCE), to modern-day urban planning through evolving concepts of Ebenezer Howard’s Garden city movement (1903) and Le Corbusier’s Radiant cities (1933), urban architects and city engineers have had to continuously tackle unique planning and design challenges, by suggesting various adaptive and mitigative strategies which fit the location’s ecological and cultural practices. Similar insights and ingenious solutions are still relevant for today’s practitioners and policy makers (Yang and Li, 2016). However, urban planning in the 21st century faces previously unforeseen and unpredictable challenges. Whether it involves providing resilient landscapes for a changing climate (Bellinson and Chu, 2019; Lafortezza et al., 2018), addressing rapid urbanization (Buettner, 2015; Martins et al., 2018), planning adaptation for natural disasters (Bertilsson et al., 2019; Daniel et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019), or undertaking ecological restoration of degraded urban areas (Hu et al., 2018; Wirth et al., 2018); the primary goal remains the same: building better, more resilient, sustainable, and prosperous urban spaces.

AB  - As of August 2022, 39 out of the 49 Asia-Pacific member States included in this report, have made carbon neutrality and net-zero pledges, and have started developing enabling frameworks to the support implementation of their commitments. However, very few of these pledges are supported by updated and ambitious NDC commitments that will scale down greenhouse gas emissions to keep global warming within 1.5°C pathway . The Asia-Pacific region will only be able to drive ambitious climate action when such pledges are supported with higher ambition of NDC commitments. Since COP26, 13 countries have updated their approach to fight climate change. Progress is being made across different subregions, and by countries with different income levels. While there is some progress in developing synergies between green growth, development strategies and long-term low- emissions strategies, more can be achieved during the NDC updates process, which can start any time with a final submission in 2025. Indeed, those Asia-Pacific countries that have included innovation and roll out of decarbonization technologies will be at an advantage during the implementation of their commitments. Given the current volume of greenhouse gas emissions in the Asia-Pacific region, it is important to focus on removing the barriers to decarbonization of key and carbon-intensive sectors through phasing down and phasing out coal, reducing dependence on other fossil fuels, scaling up penetration of renewable energy resources and e-mobility, and enhancing energy efficiency, as well as encouraging low-carbon recovery from COVID-19 pandemic, which can create jobs and contribute to sustainable economic revival. With the current turmoil in energy markets and fast declining costs of renewables, now is the time for Asia-Pacific countries to aggressively scale up investments in renewable energy production and improve energy efficiency in order to enhance decarbonization efforts substantially. Additional opportunities to scale up decarbonization and enhance current NDC commitments as recommended by the Glasgow Climate Pact, include increased investments in nature-based solutions (NbS), and ensuring protection of that natural wealth, which can help reduce the gap between the current NDC commitments and the required greenhouse gas emissions reductions to keep global warming within 1.5°C pathway. Most governments in the Asia-Pacific region have indicated, in their NDCs, that the delivery on nature-based solutions (NbS) is contingent on external financing. However, international financing for NbS is contested and limited. Further, in recent years, youth and children have begun to recognize their potential as agents for raising climate ambition and are voicing their concerns regarding current insufficient climate action. This prompts governments to ensure that the youth and children can take a seat at the decision- making table, and that their concerns are taken into account when reviewing the next steps for NDC commitments

This study uses high-resolution flood and loss models to quantify the impacts of coastal wetlands in the northeastern USA on (i) regional flood damages by Hurricane Sandy and (ii) local annual flood losses in Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey. Using an extensive database of property exposure, the regional study shows that wetlands avoided $625 Million in direct flood damages during Hurricane Sandy. The local study combines these models with a database of synthetic storms in Ocean County and estimates a 16% average reduction in annual flood losses by salt marshes with higher reductions at lower elevations. Together, the studies quantify the risk reduction ecosystem services of marsh wetlands. Measuring these benefits in collaboration with the risk modelling industry is crucial for assessing risk accurately and, where appropriate, aligning conservation and risk reduction goals.

AB  - As coastal communities face increasing chronic and acute hazards, nature-based coastal engineering solutions have experienced a rapid growth in popularity and interest. Recent works on this topic have shown that “Green Infrastructure” may be effective at mitigating coastal hazards and therefore provide sustainable adaptation alternatives to traditional engineering solutions such as seawalls and breakwaters. However, the amount of protection that green infrastructure can provide has yet to be quantified broadly, which makes it difficult to propose engineering solutions using these systems. Additionally, the intrinsic randomness of nature introduces a variety of uncertainties that have not been quantified, further limiting the use of green infrastructure in engineering design. Work to date on emergent vegetation, such as mangrove trees, has focused primarily on reduced-scale models in a laboratory setting and centered on wave height attenuation. Little existing research has examined the impacts of emergent vegetation on the attenuation of wave forces. The purpose of this study is to quantify the wave force attenuation by an idealized mangrove forest at a prototype scale and provide guidance to engineers in the design of mangrove forests for this purpose. For our study a 1:1 scale physical model of a mangrove forest was built in the Large Wave Flume at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University. A test wall was placed behind the model mangrove forest, representing a coastal building. Regular and random waves at four different water depths were generated by a wavemaker, propagated through the forest, and impacted the test wall on which the wave generated pressures were measured. Wave heights before and after the model forest were used to compare with the integrated wave pressures (forces) and assess attenuation caused by the mangrove forest at two different stem densities. The model trees were constructed based off existing studies that defined and quantified the characteristic parameters of a mangrove forest such as average diameter at breast height, average diameter of the roots and the density of the forest in trees per meter squared. Two forest densities and a control case with no trees were tested. The densities and other parameters of our forest were derived from the aggregate of previous publications. A field study was also completed as part of this experiment which examined six forests, both undisturbed and restored forests, near the Port St. Lucie inlet in Jupiter, Florida. In the companion work to this document, (Kelty, 2021) the drag coefficient for use in existing wave height attenuation models was determined in this same experiment as well as a methodology using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to quantify the engineering parameters of the forest. This document combined the advances made in (Kelty, 2021) regarding wave height attenuation with existing, and well known models for wave forces estimation such as (Goda, 2010), to see if these two bodies of work could be used in concert to model the wave forces attenuation properties of mangrove trees. Our experiment found that as waves propagate through the mangroves, the wave heights are reduced, but the wave period and wavelengths remain relatively constant. Additionally, the hydrodynamic pressures underneath the wave are not significantly changed. With these results, our study shows that engineers can model the wave heights with the drag coefficients quantified in (Kelty, 2021) and then use the new wave heights as an input into existing empirical models for wave-induced forces on coastal structures. The accuracy of the method of (Goda, 2010) ranged from -49% to 6% for regular wave cases and -2% to 47% for random wave cases. Additionally, the trends in the predicted forces from (Goda, 2010) aligned well with the trends that we observed in our data. Additional work by (Cuomo, Allsop, Bruce, & Pearson, 2010) for breaking waves also showed excellent agreement with our data for random waves. Their predicted values had an accuracy range between 8% to 26% where our test cases fell within the range of parameters tested in their experiment. Our study found that the underlying assumptions upon which these existing works were built hold true even with the presence of an offshore mangrove forest, showing that the existing wave forces estimation tools and works investigating wave height attenuation from mangroves can be combined and used in the design of green infrastructure engineering solutions.

AB  - As a novel type of composite breakwater, hollow artificial shells based on rubble mound bases are proposed. The main concept is using shapes from nature to overcome a nature phenomenon (waves). This type of shells is distinguished from other species. Its length and width are almost twice the height, which increases the stability of every individual shell. Additionally, the out-layer grooves and the semicircular shape smoothly dissipate incident waves. The new composite breakwater was investigated physically in a wide wave flume under the effect of regular waves. The breakwater performance was introduced through wave reflection, wave transmission, and wave dissipation coefficients. Several varying wave actions (wave height, wave period) were applied to the breakwater in four states: emergent, partially submerged, submerged and fully submerged. The partially submerged case showed the best efficiency compared with other states. The reflection coefficient ranges from 0.16 to 0.46, the transmission coefficient ranges from 0.3 to 0.48, and the dissipation coefficient ranges from 0.75 to 0.92. The Partially submerged breakwaters have been compared with some of the most commonly used types of breakwaters, and have shown to have better efficiency, particularly in areas with short coastal waves. Also, the crest width of a submerged breakwater can be reduced dramatically to less than half, by deploying artificial shell blocks on the crest.

AB  - As a changing climate alters ocean conditions, the redistribution of marine ecosystem services and benefits will affect maritime activities and societal value chains. While the magnitude of the effects will be diverse and region-specific and vary across sectors, both humans and nature will be subjected to increasing and intense negative impacts. Furthermore, the impacts of a changing climate on maritime economies are yet largely unknown and there are uncertainties and limitations of climate and ocean management options, which are at a very early or experimental stage. Significant gaps in technical, institutional and financial capacities for climate change adaptation between developed and developing countries exist, pointing to an imbalanced response to the global climate crisis. Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is being developed and implemented worldwide as a way to foster sustainable ocean use and management. The spatial and temporal distribution of human uses in marine spaces through MSP aims to minimise conflicts and promote synergies among uses, as well as between uses and the environment. In addition to the many environmental and socio-economic challenges which MSP seeks to address, a changing climate must now be included. Mainstreaming climate change into MSP will allow for improved preparedness and response, as well as reduced vulnerability of marine systems. “Climate-smart MSP” refers to planning initiatives in the ocean space which integrate and may adapt to the effects of a changing climate. For MSP to become “climate-smart”, data and knowledge on the pathways through which climate change impacts marine ecosystems and human uses are needed at appropriate spatial scales. These should address the inherent uncertainties in planning scenarios themselves with regard to climate change, particularly in relation to their ability to adapt to changing ocean conditions. In this regard, the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) will play a key role, as one of its main objectives is filling the significant remaining gaps in marine knowledge, including the effects of climate change. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and other spatial marine management tools can also be used to promote specific adaptation-relevant features, while climate literacy can help build capacities and facilitate behavioural change to better cope with climate-related challenges. Increasing the knowledge base on the impacts of a changing climate is necessary. This includes building evidence on the uses most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and integrating their possible spatial relocation in MSP; knowledge on conservation priority species and keystone ecosystem components and including them in impact analysis assessments to promote their sustainability and resilience; and an understanding of the social and economic implications of climate change, particularly in communities highly dependent on marine resources for their livelihoods. It is also necessary to raise awareness on the effects of a changing climate on marine ecosystems and maritime activities, and fostering new behaviours and social norms in local communities to improve knowledge and skills on opportunities for sustainable mitigation and adaptation options, for enhancing climate literacy and promoting sustainable actions at the local level. This involves integrating strategic climate objectives into overall sustainable development and environmental policies using climate-smart, nature-inclusive MSP as a common framework for setting up meaningful and effective actions across regions, which may be achieved through establishing interdisciplinary MSP networks. Practical adaptation and mitigation strategies at appropriate scales, using fit-for-purpose, spatially explicit and operationally mature nature-based solutions, as well as strategic investments to achieve long-term visions reflected in climate-smart, nature-inclusive spatial plans, are also required.

Without mitigation and adaptation measures, annual damages from coastal flooding in the EU-28 could increase sharply from €1.4 billion nowadays to almost €240 billion by 2100. Around 95% of these impacts could be avoided through moderate mitigation and by raising dykes where human settlements and economically important areas exist along the coastline. The extent to which adaptation can lessen the effects of coastal flooding and at what cost is sensitive to the investment strategy adopted.

AB  - Anthropogenic litter is a ubiquitous stressor in the global ocean, and poses ominous threats to oceanic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At the terrestrial-ocean interface, tropical mangrove forests are subject to substantial exposure to mismanaged litter from inland and marine sources. While the effects of litter in different marine ecosystems are well-documented, research on the ecological consequences of litter pollution on mangroves remain nascent stage. Here, we investigated anthropogenic litter concentration, composition, probable sources, and impact on coastal mangroves along the Central West coast of India. The mean concentration of trapped litter was measured 8.5 ± 1.9 items/m2 (ranged 1.4 ̶ 26.9 items/m2), and 10.6 ± 0.5 items/tree (ranged 0 ̶ 85 items/tree) on the mangrove floor and mangrove canopy, respectively. Plastic dominated 83.02 % of all litter deposited on the mangrove forest floor and 93.4 % of all entangled litter on mangrove canopy. Most litter comprised single-use plastic products across all surveyed locations. Mangrove floor cleanliness was assessed using several indices, such as Clean Coast Index, General Index, Hazardous Items Index, and Pollution Load Index, reiterating an inferior cleanliness status. The pollution load index indicates “Hazard level I" plastic pollution risk across the mangroves. Litter concentration differed markedly across all sites. However, a significantly higher concentration of stranded litter was detected in the densely populated urban agglomeration and rural areas with inadequate solid waste management. Probable sources of litter indicate land-based (local) and sea-originated (fishing). Supportive information on the transport and accumulation of marine litter is examined based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFS) model version 2 reanalysis of surface wind and current pattern across the Arabian Sea followed by MIKE simulated tide-induced coastal current. Mangrove pneumatophores and branches were found to be damaged by entangled plastics. Hence, determining litter quantum and their probable input source is pivotal in mitigating anthropogenic litter impact on mangrove ecosystems and fostering mangrove conservation. Overall, results envisage that stringent enforcement, implementation of an integrated solid waste management framework, and general behavioral change of the public are crucial to mitigate litter/plastic pollution.

AB  - Anthropogenic impact has largely altered the estuarine environment. Today, Nature-based solutions (NbS) are required to respond to challenges such as flooding that affect both the human population and estuarine ecosystems. Estuarine ecosystems such as saltmarshes and floodplain forests provide valuable services, and wetland restoration for flood control is suggested. Recently, flow velocities attenuating the effects of juvenile floodplain willows and wave attenuation through White willow trees under extreme conditions have been found. Services in flood control seemed promising. However, large woods do not bend and may cause turbulence. On the contrary, complex and flexible woody vegetation bends in response to currents and reduces velocities, thereby inducing lower turbulence, but knowledge of the diversity and structure of tidal willow floodplain forests (TWFF) is lacking. Thus, first, an observational study on the occurrence of TWFF in European estuaries along the North Sea was carried out. Based on findings in aerial images, only small TWFF fragments were confirmed in the field for the Elbe, Ems, Dutch delta, and the Scheldt estuary. Based on these findings and the analyses of management plans, the restoration of TWFF was planned, implemented, and studied, including a long-term study at the Elbe estuary upstream stretch. The results of the restoration efforts are provided, including the long-term study (2012–2022) on a restored TWFF in the Elbe estuary, which could serve as a pilot for TWFF restoration and adapting estuarine communities to climate change via NbS.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are considered as major threat to coastal wetlands. Much of anthropogenic activities are changing coastal wetland ecosystem globally. Coastal wetlands are known to provide various benefits to people. However, the impacts on coastal wetland ecosystem will greatly affect the services. Thus the future of coastal wetlands is uncertain, challenging to understand the concept of resilience that will enable the coastal wetland ecosystems to adapt and respond to stresses that will enable the ecosystem to retain the functions as to provide the services that are beneficial for the coastal community in reducing the risk exposure. The focus of paper is to understand and analyze the concept of resilience of coastal wetland ecosystems. An attempt has been made to under the linkages between coastal resilience and coastal wetland ecosystem service. The principle findings of the paper reveals that resilience based strategies should be considered in addressing the multiple issues of the coastal wetland ecosystem in providing multiple services and benefits.

AB  - Anchored Large Woody Debris (LWD) is increasingly being used as one of several nature-based coastal protection strategies along the north-western coasts of Canada and the US. As an alternative to conventional hard armoring (e.g., seawalls), its usage is widely considered to be less harmful to the coastal ecosystem while maintaining the ability to protect the beaches against wave attack and erosion. The effects of seawalls on beaches have been extensively studied; however, the performance and efficacy of LWD and its potential as a suitable alternative to seawalls (and other shoreline protection structures) are still understudied in current research. This paper presents and compares the effects of a conventional vertical seawall with two different LWD structures on beach morphology and wave reflection through large-scale physical modeling in a wave flume at a 1:5 scale. An assessment of techniques used to measure beach morphology and an assessment of model effects were included in the study. It was found that the wave reflection could be reduced by using a single log instead of a wall structure, while changes in the beach morphology response largely depended on the type of the LWD structure. A stacked log wall showed near-identical behavior as a conventional seawall. Visible model effects from the experiments, including the effect of the flume sidewalls on the beach morphology, were quantified and analyzed to inform future research.

AB  - An index of vulnerability to coastal change, integrating indices of social vulnerability and exposure to coastal hazards, was created for East Africa to identify ‘areas of priority concern’ for risk reduction. Currently, 22% of East Africa’s coastline and 3.5 million people are at higher levels of exposure to coastal hazards, which would increase, respectively, to 39% and 6.9 million people if mangroves, coral reefs and seagrasses are lost. Madagascar and Mozambique show the largest proportion of the coastline at higher exposure, while Kenya and Tanzania benefit the most from natural coastal protection. Coral reefs protect 2.5 million people from higher exposure, mostly in Mombasa, Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam. Considering Mozambique, Kenya and Tanzania, the latter is the least, and the former is the most vulnerable. Under current conditions, 17 (out of 86) coastal districts are considered ‘areas of priority concern’; four of these are critically exposed as over 90% of their shoreline length are at higher exposure (Zavala, Inharrime, Manhica and Mandlakaze, all in southern Mozambique). These locations are of critical concern for any present or future coastal development due to the high level of exposure posed to both vulnerable people and investments. Habitat loss would increase the number of ‘priority concern’ districts to 24; some would show great increase in the population exposed (e.g. Pemba and Mossuril in Mozambique). Applying this knowledge to identify where ecosystem-based management should be prioritised to promote social and environmental resilience is timely and urgent in East Africa.

AB  - An increasing abundance of projects demonstrate that coastal management strategies that align engineering and ecological objectives can deliver a wide range benefits. Better understanding how these strategies fare under stress is crucially important, including in comparison to traditional coastal engineering approaches, in order to inform where they might be a viable alternative or complement to conventional coastal storm risk management. In particular, the prospect that these strategies may be able to recover from disturbances and adapt to better survive future disturbances with minimal or no intervention is compelling. However, no formal accounting method exists to assess how ecosystem-based approaches contribute to the resilience of coastal systems, that is, their ability to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt from stressors. An assessment rubric is developed and demonstrated for Engineering With Nature® projects and limitations and ways forward are discussed.

AB  - An experimental study of unidirectional flow through a model mangrove forest measured both velocity and forces on individual trees. The individual trees were 1/12th scale models of mature Rhizophora, including 24 prop roots distributed in a three-dimensional layout. Thirty-two model trees were distributed in a staggered array producing a 2.5 m long forest. The velocity evolved from a boundary layer profile at the forest leading edge to a vertical profile determined by the vertical distribution of frontal area, with significantly higher velocity above the prop roots. Fully developed conditions were reached at the fifth tree row from the leading edge. Within the root zone the velocity was reduced by up to 50% and the TKE was increased by as much as fivefold, relative to the upstream conditions. TKE in the root zone was mainly produced by root and trunk wakes, and it agreed in magnitude with the estimation obtained using the Tanino and Nepf (2008) formulation. Maximum TKE occurred at the top of the roots, where a strong shear region was associated with the change in frontal area. The drag measured on individual trees decreased from the leading edge and reached a constant value at the fifth row and beyond, i.e., in the fully developed region. The drag exhibited a quadratic dependence on velocity, which justified the definition of a quadratic drag coefficient. Once the correct drag length-scale was defined, the measured drag coefficients collapsed to a single function of Reynolds number.

AB  - An experimental analysis of flow interaction with a model 26 m long Rhyzophora mangrove forest is performed. Mangrove trees are built representing a mature Rhyzophora forest and a 1:6 scale is considered to fit the forest into the flume. Scaled random wave conditions representative of these environments are tested. Results reveal a strong influence of the facility induced friction in the overall obtained wave height attenuation. This additional damping produced by bottom and walls friction should be considered in order to properly evaluate the attenuation capacity of the mangrove trees. The analytical drag forces obtained from wave attenuation analysis agree well with measured forces within the forest when damping induced by bottom and walls friction is subtracted. These analytical forces can then represent a first estimate of the drag force used in several analytical or numerical models to quantify the wave attenuation capacity produced by mangrove trees.

AB  - An estimated 100 million people inhabit coastal areas at risk from flooding and erosion due to climate change. Seagrass meadows, like other coastal ecosystems, attenuate waves. Due to inconsistencies in how wave attenuation is measured results cannot be directly compared. We synthesised data from laboratory and field experiments of seagrass-wave attenuation by converting measurements to drag coefficients (CD). Drag coefficients varied from 0.02–5.12 with = 0.74 for studies conducted in turbulent flow in non-storm conditions. A statistical model suggested that seagrass species affects CD although the exact mechanism remains unclear. A wave model using the estimated as an input parameter demonstrated that wave attenuation increased with meadow length, shoot density, shoot width and canopy height. Findings can be used to estimate wave attenuation by seagrass, in any given set of conditions.

AB  - An economic assessment for a non-market resource like sandy beaches is always a challenge for Thailand's coastal policy planners due to the lack of data availability, especially on the national scale. While beach tourism in Thailand has been an essential part of the Thai economy, the sandy beaches are probably exposed to the future sea-level rise. Therefore, the need for tourism benefits of the beaches should be conducted. The research attempted to measure the effect of sandy beach characteristics and hotel location on hotel room rates. A sample of 3319 hotel rooms across Thailand's coastal sub-districts, covering the entire sandy beaches in Thailand, was collected through a hotel-booking online database during the country's peak season. The considered variables include hotel room attributes, sandy beach characteristics, hotel locations, and coastal infrastructures. Through a hedonic price model based on geographically weighted regression analysis, the relationship between the dependent variables (hotel room rate) and the independent variables (selected beach variable) was estimated to evaluate the marginal effect and its spatial variations. The tourism benefit was calculated assuming the marginal effect of the hotel's beachfront locations on hotel price. The study suggested that the location in front of the beach raised the average hotel room rates by 13–41%. The results emphasized the significant spatial variability of the effect of beachfront location on the hotel price. In addition, the effect of beach protection structures (i.e., seawall, breakwaters, groins) on the hotel price was also investigated and implied a slight drop by 8–15% of the average price. The other sandy beach variables (such as beach length, width, and slope) effects on hotel price were also investigated. The finding of this study aims to help policymakers select and design proper adaptations to coastal erosion on tourist beaches in Thailand.

AB  - Amid increasing frequency and intensity of storms, there is a growing need for resilient shoreline protection strategies, especially those that can also provide ecological and economic benefits to coastal communities. Coastal marshes, whether restored, protected, or constructed as part of a living shoreline provide habitats that support seafood economies, improve water quality, and contribute to marsh accretion by trapping suspended sediments. The salt marsh vegetation in these systems reduces erosion by attenuating wave energy. Though it is recognized that such strategies attenuate waves, there remains a need for better understanding the interactions between the canopy and waves, and better ways of representing these processes in wave models. This research addresses these needs using an energy-based wave model and a rich dataset of wave, vegetation, and elevation observations made at natural marshes in coastal North Carolina. In particular, this work addresses three overarching challenges: (1) Wave models applied towards prediction of wave transformation in salt marshes typically rely on empirically derived formulations of drag coefficient, but these formulations are highly variable even for similar marsh canopies and wave conditions. In answer to this challenge, the dataset and wave model were used to explore possible factors that may explain differences between past formulations. (2) There is also as yet no consensus on which dimensionless flow parameter best represents the underlying physics of wave dissipation by salt marshes. A dimensionless flow parameter that incorporates plant motion was found to relate well to drag coefficients and captured observed patterns between drag coefficient and canopy emergence. (3) While nonlinear waves are often present in nearshore regions, they are rarely accounted for in studies of wave dissipation by marshes, and the influence of nonlinear waves on drag coefficient estimates in salt marshes is unknown. To address this, a nonlinear wave model was used to estimate drag coefficients, and factors controlling the influence of nonlinear waves on drag coefficient estimates were examined.

AB  - Although viscous sediment environments along the coast strongly attenuate waves, the attenuation dynamics and physical mechanism governing the attenuation process remain relatively unknown. Extremely complex interactions between muddy seabed have become increasingly important for wave evolution studies pertaining to coastal areas. The coastal protection function of mangroves was confirmed during the 2004 South Asian tsunami. Nevertheless, most research has been limited to macro-qualitative analyses, including those on variations in the transmission coefficient Kt and reflection coefficient Kr, and subsequent comparisons. However, determining the micro-physical characteristics is challenging, similar to coastal vegetation analyses with respect to mangrove vegetation characteristics. This study aims to quantify the attenuation difference in the wave energy owing to the coastal vegetation structure, under different layout conditions and combinations. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology is used to explore the variations in the velocity field and velocity distribution during the interaction process and calculate the wave-induced kinetic energy before and after setting up the vegetation structure. The research results emphasize that the resistance and frictional effects generated by vegetation are inversely proportional to the size of the stem, and the variation of kinetic energy determined from the velocity distribution and the thickness of the vegetation stem is mainly due to the larger frictional resistance of dense vegetation, relative to the fast flow velocity above the vegetation. Different vegetation heights slightly affect the short-period waves; however, the impact on energy reduction was smaller. For long-period waves, vegetation height significantly reduces wave kinetic energy.

AB  - Although mangroves reduce the daily risk of flood for millions of people, it is still difficult to estimate the protection they provide for variable wave conditions and forest characteristics. This aspect is crucial for the promotion of conservation and restoration of mangrove forests and for the estimation of how the coastal protection service they provide will evolve over time. This paper presents evidence and a new method for the estimation of the relationship between mangrove forest age and wave attenuation. The forest under analysis is characterised by the age of the Rhizophora mangrove trees, where consideration is given to the differences in the maturity of its individual trees and the density of the forest. Environmental conditions are defined by water levels and incoming wave height and period. A set of empirical and analytical relations expressing wave attenuation as a function of the submerged solid volume fraction (SVF) are presented. Changes is tree morphology and forest characteristics with forest age, as well as the contribution of the tree canopy, are taken into account. Results indicate that, after restoration, it may take only 5 years to obtain a forest's maximum coastal protection capacity. Additionally, such capacity appears to be maintained throughout the forest's lifetime with minor variations, provided the forest is not affected by any conditions altering its health, such as extreme wave events or anthropogenic action that may modify its habitat. Our findings present a new approach to quantifying the protection provided by mangroves without requiring any calibration. These findings can also assist in planning mangrove restoration and assessing associated benefits by providing the incorporation of nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based adaptation into coastal management.

AB  - Although mangroves reduce annual flooding to millions of people there is not a methodology to implement these solutions and it is still difficult to estimate the protection provided by them under different environmental conditions and ecosystem properties. To move forward in the consecution of an engineering approach when implementing these solutions for coastal defense, the first step to make is to better understand and parameterize the basic physical processes involved in flow-mangroves interaction. With the aim of getting a new formulation for wave decay provided by Rhizophora mangrove forests based on flow and ecosystem properties, an experimental campaign was carried out where both wave attenuation and forces on mangrove individuals were measured under different wave conditions. Both, the hydrodynamic conditions and the mangrove forest, were scaled according to field conditions for short waves. The detailed wave attenuation and drag force measurements obtained in these experiments allowed to obtain new formulations of wave decay produced by the forest depending on the flow, i.e.: water depth, wave height and period, and on the forest characteristics, i.e.: individuals submerged solid volume fraction and density. These formulations are used to get attenuation rates under different flow and ecosystem conditions. The resultant curves provide with the wave decay produced by a specific Rhizophora forest subjected to the defined wave conditions. The forest is defined on the basis of its age, considering the differences in individual trees depending on their maturity and the density of the forest as the number of trees per unit area. Wave conditions are defined by the root mean square wave height and the peak period and water depth is also considered. The obtained curves allow to estimate the width of the forest necessary to reach a certain level of protection considering the local flow conditions and the forest age. This can assist in the inclusion of nature-based solutions in the portfolio of coastal protection measures.

AB  - Addressing global investment gaps in infrastructure has been a consistent priority for the Group of Twenty (G20) over the last decade. This has culminated in the formulation of the G20 Quality Infrastructure Investment Principles (QII) in 2019, along with the convergence of the G20 priorities and the global development goals. However, multilateral development and environmental agendas have largely missed the multiplier effect of urbanization on rising challenges such as global warming or biodiversity losses, a decades-long trend which has only been accelerated by the delivery of new infrastructure since the last global financial crisis in 2007–2008. This policy brief calls for a breakthrough in the delivery of new infrastructure, determining that in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, any new policy choices should yield high socio-economic multipliers and enhance resilience. As a number of major global ecosystems are reaching a tipping point, such as those in the Amazonia and Arctic, the timing is critical. Therefore, the delivery of designated Quality and Sustainable Infrastructure Investment Principles (QS-II) should focus on shaping new technological and financial frontiers for critical infrastructure assets on land and at sea. Prioritizing time to market acceleration through innovative partnerships between public and private market players and mobilizing financial enablers, such as sustainable procurement, can help build an accountable pathway for large-scale change and mainstream nature-based solutions in global and regional infrastructure project pipelines.

AB  - Active restoration is becoming an increasingly important conservation intervention to counteract the degradation of marine coastal ecosystems. Understanding what has motivated the scientific community to research the restoration of marine coastal ecosystems and how restoration research projects are funded is essential if we want to scale-up restoration interventions to meaningful extents. Here, we systematically review and synthesize data to understand the motivations for research on the restoration of coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, saltmarsh, and oyster reefs. We base this analysis off a published database of marine restoration studies, originally designed to estimate the cost and feasibility of marine coastal restoration, derived from mostly scientific studies published in peer-reviewed and some gray literature. For the present study, the database was updated with fields aimed at assessing the motivations, outcomes, and funding sources for each project. We classify restoration motivations into five categories: biotic, experimental, idealistic, legislative, and pragmatic. Moreover, we evaluate the variables measured and outcomes reported by the researchers and evaluate whether projects adhered to the Society for Ecological Restoration's (SER) standards for the practice of ecological restoration. The most common motivation of the scientific community to study restoration in marine coastal ecosystems was experimental i.e., to seek experimental data to answer ecological research questions or improve restoration approach, as expected since mostly peer-reviewed literature was evaluated here. There were differences in motivations among the five coastal ecosystems. For instance, biodiversity enhancement was the most common case for a biotic motivation in mangrove restoration projects. The most common metrics evaluated were growth/productivity, survivorship, habitat function, physical attributes, and reproduction. For most ecosystems, ecological outcomes were frequently reported, with socio-economic implications of the restoration rarely mentioned, except for mangroves. Projects were largely funded by governmental grants with some investment from private donations, non-governmental organizations, and the involvement of volunteers. Our findings and database provide critical data to align future research of the scientific community with the real social, economic and policy needs required to scale-up marine coastal restoration projects.

AB  - Accumulation of fine grained sediment and natural regeneration of mangrove species are normally prioritized to control erosion on mangrove dominated muddy coasts. Current solutions to manage eroded mangrove dominated muddy coasts have been not as cost-effective as expected. Entrapping microsites, although mainly used for restoring eroded terrestrial resources, were first tested for restoring an eroded mangrove dominated muddy coast of Vam Ray, Hon Dat, Kien Giang, Vietnam. Entrapping microsites, constructed with a 50 cm layer of discarded Melaleuca small sticks that were overlain on the surface of the site, accumulated a high level of fine grained sediment and promoted robust natural regeneration or regrowth of local mangrove species after approximately two years. The effectiveness and efficiency of the Vam Ray Melaleuca entrapping microsites provide a good basis on which further research and ground works can proceed.

AB  - According to new sea-level rise projections, the global mean sea level could rise by as much as 2.0 meters by the end of this century. To adjust to the unpredictable fluctuations in water levels and precipitation, coastal communities must react with innovative planning strategies. Mangrove infrastructure is identified in this research-design study as an adaptable design approach that could improve coastal communities' resilience to sea-level rise and solutions to extend the shoreline by restoring the mangrove habitat. This thesis recommends mangrove infrastructure to achieve these aims but considers its limits and relates the combined beneficial impact of grey and green infrastructure to shoreline regeneration. On the extent of Al Sanad and Al Eker residential communities in the Tubli Bay region of Bahrain, mangrove infrastructure is included in a planning application that directly tackles sea level rise. Merepinna tõusu uute prognooside kohaselt võib globaalne keskmine merepind selle sajandi lõpuks tõusta kuni 2,0 meetrit. Et kohaneda veetaseme ja sademete ettearvamatute kõikumistega, peavad rannikualade kogukonnad reageerima rakendades uuenduslikke planeerimisstrateegiaid. Selles disainiuurimuses käsitletakse mangroovitaristut kui kohanemisvõimelist kujundusstrateegiat, mis võiks parandada rannikualade kogukondade kohanemist merepinna tõusule ja lahendusi rannajoone pikendamiseks mangroovide elupaikade taastamise kaudu. Mangroove nähakse kui soovitatavat lähenemist eesmärkide saavutamiseks, kuid arutletakse ka piirangute üle ning halli ja rohelise taristu kombineeritud kasulikku mõju rannajoone uuenemisele. Al Sanadi ja Al Ekeri elamukogukondade ulatuses Bahreinis Tubli lahe piirkonnas on mangroovitaristu lisatud planeerimisrakendusse, mis tegeleb otseselt merepinna tõusuga.

AB  - Accelerating Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet ice mass losses and potential West Antarctic Ice Sheet instability may lead to higher than previously anticipated future sea levels. The New York City Panel on Climate Change Antarctic Rapid Ice Melt (ARIM) upper-end, low probability sea level rise (SLR) scenario, which incorporates recent ice loss trends, improved ice sheet-ocean-atmosphere modeling, and potential ice sheet destabilization, projects SLR of up to 2.1 m by the 2080s and up to 2.9 m by 2100, at high greenhouse gas emissions (NPCC, 2019). These results exceed previous high-end SLR projections (90th percentile) of 1.5 m by the 2080s and 1.9 m by 2100, relative to 2000–2004 (NPCC, 2015). By 2100, the 1% annual chance (100-year) floodplain could cover 1/3 of the city's total area under ARIM; around 1/5 of the area could be flooded during monthly high tides. Some low-lying locations could become permanently inundated by late century. Will New York City coastal resiliency initiatives, guided, in part by NPCC findings, suffice for very high sea levels? Additional research is needed to determine technological, environmental, or economic limitations to coastal protection and to decide when and where strategic relocation may become necessary.

AB  - AbstractThe rapid decline of coral reefs worldwide has led to an increased focus on conservation and restoration of these marvelous ecosystems. Conservation and restoration interventions benefit from scientific data including those that describe species distribution, ocean currents, the abiotic and biotic reef environment, and the degree of disturbance on coral reefs. Various types of omics data are becoming increasingly available for coral reef organisms, and these can also advance coral reef conservation and restoration and can sometimes provide insights that cannot be obtained from other data types. This book brings together genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data for reef-building corals that bear relevance to their protection, describes how these data can be obtained, what their value in coral reef conservation and restoration is and where the field is heading in the near future. This chapter provides an introduction to the book.

AB  - AbstractThe climate change impact highly threatens coastal regions. Coastal populations face a range of climate-related risks such as cyclones, sea-level rise, and coastal flooding. The built environment has a significant impact over the local climate and environment of coastal communities. Coastal areas are identified to be central locations of human habitats creating coastal urban centres further enhances the risk. Therefore, developing substantial climate adaptation strategies for the built environment in coastal regions is essential. In developing suitable adaptation measures, it is essential to understand the impacts of climate change on the coastal built environment in detail. This research is conducted as a part of a colloborative research project BEACON (Built Environment leArning for Climate adaptation), co-financed by the European Union Erasmus + programme. This study conducted a detailed review of the climate change impact on the built environment in coastal regions. A systematic literature review based on three academic databases Science Direct, Emerald Insight and Scopus, was conducted. The synthesised data were analysed using the thematic analysis technique, and the climate change impacts were mainly categorised as physical and non-physical impacts. The primary climate change evidence in coastal regions is sea level rise, weather conditions, and precipitation changes. The associated disaster risks and their physical and non-physical (economic, social, and environmental) impacts in the coastal regions have been summarised into a single framework. This could be used as a basis to develop tangible climate adaptation measures in the coastal built environment.KeywordsClimate change impactBuilt environmentCoastal regionDisaster risk

AB  - AbstractThe Asia–Pacific coastal region is at the forefront of climate change. Coastal and island communities endure climate-related hazards and marine and coastal ecosystem degradation, which repeatedly challenge their transition to a sustainable blue economy. Therefore, climate change adaptation in coastal zone communities is imperative, particularly, for developing countries where financial access is an ever-present challenge. Some existing studies have tracked global adaptation finance flows but the scale of finance in the ocean and coastal zones remains unknown. Detailed public finance monitoring would offer greater insights to close the finance gap for vulnerable coastal and island countries. This study aims to comprehend the Asia–Pacific adaptation finance landscape and show its aid flow trends and features, with a special focus on ocean and coastal areas. Results show that the amount of adaptation funds directed to the oceans and coastal regions in the Asia–Pacific has gradually increased, with a fivefold growth over the past decade. Recently, “blue finance” or ocean sustainability funding has attracted attention and accelerated concrete actions by the international community as a whole. Thus, this study also provides insight on how emerging blue finance initiatives promote climate change adaptation in the ocean and coastal areas.KeywordsAsia–PacificAdaptation financeBlue financeClimate change adaptationOcean and coastal zones

AB  - AbstractDespite knowledge of the multiple benefits nature-based solutions (NBS) provides, a critical barrier to their widespread adoption is a lack of knowledge over their financing, particularly who should pay for an NBS and how it can be financed. Furthermore, financing NBS is challenging as the solutions are highly context-specific. The result is a gap between current investments in NBS and what is required for the world to meet various climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation targets. Nonetheless, a range of innovative financial instruments and approaches are available to implement and mainstream NBS at various scales and in different contexts to close this gap. Specifically, public, private, and blended financing tools are available to develop NBS across terrestrial and marine ecosystems, involving multiple stakeholders and in jurisdictions of varying climates and income levels. Based on the case studies, the following best practices have been identified for other regions of the world implementing NBS to societal challenges.KeywordsDebt-for-nature swapsMarket-based instrumentsGreen debt financingPayments for ecosystem servicesBiodiversity offsetsPublic–private partnershipsVoluntary carbon markets

To this end, the research focuses on two of the ecosystems, where this type of tourism exerts pressure on a global scale: seagrass meadows and coral reefs. Based on Scopus and WoS databases, different levels of analysis have been carried through the application of bibliometrics to identify the most prevalent topics and future research trends.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> Results  The main results are summarised as follows. On the one hand, many publications in the scientific sector analyse how tourism and recreational activity affect specific marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs. On the other hand, the phenomenon of Global Change and the social and environmental effects on marine ecosystems with significant tourism potential have been identified as one of the most studied research topics. Finally, emerging research trends have been identified, including environmental monitoring and tracking programs aimed at controlling tourism, aspects related to the participation of the population and local tourism sectors, and the role of ecotourism in marine protected areas.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> Conclusions  In conclusion, a greater commitment from the public administration and a greater social awareness of the ecosystem services it generates is needed. If the species and the natural environment are not conserved and protected, the tourist attractiveness of these areas would be lost and, ultimately, the tourism of the area would change, with the consequent loss of well-being for the whole community.</jats:p> </jats:sec>

AB  - Abstract: Swan Island is a 10.12 ha island located in the Maryland waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Because of its value as a natural wave break for the town of Ewell on nearby Smith Island, as well as the ongoing erosion and subsidence of the island, in 2019 US Army Corps of Engineers USACEBaltimore District placed 45,873 m of dredged sediment and planted 200,000 marsh plants. This restoration provided an opportunity to quantify the engineering that is, resilience and ecological performance of the island, postplacement. The lack of quantitative data on the performance of natural features such as islands has led to perceived uncertainties that are often cited as barriers to implementation. To address these data gaps, a multidisciplinary collaboration of five government entities identified project objectives and monitoring parameters through a series of mediated workshops and then developed a conceptual model to articulate those parameters and the linkages between them. This monitoring and adaptive management plan MAMP documents those monitoring parameters and procedures and can serve as an example for other scales, regions, and research questions. Documenting research and monitoring efforts may help to foster widespread acceptance of nature-based solutions such as islands.

AB  - Abstract Under the umbrella term of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) fall measures from a wide range of disciplines. With regard to coastal protection, coastal ecosystems represent possible and promising NbS to coastal threats such as storm surges or erosion. Around the globe, the looming climate change and related developments in the coastal landscapes as well as a paradigm shift in societal views shifted the focus of decision-makers and researchers onto NbS for coastal protection, driving the need for a comprehensive up-to-date review of coastal ecosystems like salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass meadows, beaches, dunes, coral, and shellfish/oyster reefs and their benefits for Water, Nature and People alike. While existing reviews of NbS have mainly focused on the idea of softer coastal protection in general and constraints regarding management and regulations, this study reviews not only the characteristics, features and needs of the coastal ecosystems under consideration but also examines the ecosystems’ potential and related processes for coastal protection, their ecological as well as their societal benefits. This review paper is based on an extensive literature review and analysis of scientific publications, books and book sections, guidelines, reports, policy recommendations and strategies. In order to create a basis for the selection of site-suitable adaptation measures for local coastal challenges and questions, this study compiles the coastal ecosystems’ key features and elaborates the provided ecosystem services for protective, ecological and societal needs. The highlighted diversity of processes within ecosystems that directly cause or support coastal protection, in combination with the multiple ecological services and societal benefits, underlines the great potential of coastal ecosystems to bridge the gap between coastal engineering and nature conservation. In combination with existing coastal protection, coastal ecosystems as NbS can serve both disciplines equally and provide an integral, sustainable element in the adaptation of coastal protection to climate change.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Managed realignment (MR) involves the landward relocation of sea defences to foster the (re)creation of coastal wetlands and achieve nature-based coastal protection. The wider application of MR is impeded by knowledge gaps related to lacking data on its effectiveness under extreme surges and the role of changes in vegetation cover, for example due to sea-level rise. We employ a calibrated and validated hydrodynamic model to explore relationships between surge attenuation, MR width(/area) and vegetation cover for the MR site of Freiston Shore, UK. We model a range of extreme water levels for four scenarios of variable MR width. We further assess the effects of reduced vegetation cover for the actual MR site and for the scenario of the site with the largest width. We show that surges are amplified for all but the largest two site scenarios, suggesting that increasing MR width results in higher attenuation rates. Substantial surge attenuation (up to 18 cm km<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) is only achieved for the largest site. The greatest contribution to the attenuation in the largest site scenario may come from water being reflected from the breached dike. While vegetation cover has no statistically significant effect on surge attenuations in the original MR site, higher coverage leads to higher attenuation rates in the largest site scenario. We conclude that at the open coast, only large MR sites (&gt; 1148 m width) can attenuate surges with return periods &gt; 10 years, while increased vegetation cover and larger MR widths enable the attenuation of even higher surges.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Developing countries face risks from coastal hazards that are being amplified by climate change. The selection of effective adaptation interventions to manage these risks requires a sufficiently accurate assessment of the coastal hazard at a given location. Yet challenges remain in terms of understanding local coastal risks given the coarseness of global wave models and the paucity of locally scaled data in most developing countries, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Vanuatu. This paper aims to examine the differences in hazard assessment and adaptation option selections arising from analyses using globally versus locally scaled data on coastal processes. As a case study, we focused on an eroding cliff face in Port Resolution on Tanna Island, Vanuatu, which is of concern to the local community and government authorities. The coastal process modeling revealed that the global wave data generated unrealistically high predictions of wave height within Port Resolution Bay. Expensive engineering adaptations designed to provide coastal protection were therefore likely to fail in preventing ongoing cliff erosion. In this case, the best adaptation solution involves changing land use to revegetate and help stabilize the cliff top. Our case study highlights the importance of accurate hazard assessment, especially in data-poor regions where the extrapolation of global datasets and models in the absence of local data can result in poor adaptation decision-making. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary approach applied here can be applied in other data-poor regions to strengthen analyses exploring the benefits of local adaptation interventions.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Coastal protection comprises shoreline preservation and stabilisation as well as flood protection. Besides these technical aspects, coastal protection also represents a genuine social endeavour. Within this interplay of technical and social dimensions, planning and acting for the safety of people and assets along the coastline has become increasingly difficult for the responsible authorities. Within this context, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for coastal protection offer a promising addition to and adaptation for existing protection measures such as dikes, sea walls or groynes. They bear the potential to adapt to shifting boundary conditions caused by climate change and cater the growing social call for sustainable solutions that benefit water, nature and people alike. This paper analyses, how NbS can fit into the entangled and historically grown system of coastal protection. As a paradigmatic example, the German islands of Amrum and Föhr were chosen. To contextualise the topic, a brief recap of the formation of these North Frisian Islands and their social history regarding coastal protection is given. This will be followed by a review of the relevant literature on the development of coastal protection on the two islands including its historical development. Using the theory of Social Representations (SRs), these historical insights are analytically contrasted with a synchronic snapshot gained from stakeholder interviews about the assessment of protective measures, and their anticipated future development with regard to the possible feasibility and implementation of NbS. This analysis reveals that, historically and synchronically seen, coastal protection on both islands is rather characterised by a dynamic rationale and the constant testing of and experimenting with different measures and concepts. However, well-established measures like diking or the construction of brushwood groynes for foreland creation are not being questioned while new approaches running against this rationale such as NbS are in many cases initially met with scepticism and doubt. Out of this follows that past and present dynamics in coastal protection play a vital role in planning. Hence, the implementation of NbS as signposts for the future requires an integrated and balanced interdisciplinary approach that considers the socio-technical dimensions of coastal protection for future coastal adaptation.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract  Macroalgae (seaweeds) are drawing interest as potential tools for climate mitigation within a burgeoning blue carbon agenda. With the high rates of net primary productivity, they are one of the main carbon sinks in the global ocean, both as biomass standing stock and as vectors of carbon export through detritus pathways. When coupled with their intrinsic ecological value, their contribution to coastal economies, and their current and future scope for aquaculture production, it is perhaps unsurprising that macroalgae have become a focus for nature-based carbon sequestration. However, the research community must guard against the hyperbole that is beginning to permeate the conversation, such as that which beset the microalgae biofuel movement. Macroalgae undoubtedly have a role to play in combating carbon pollution, and perhaps before significant investment is committed to ramping up macroalgae aquaculture, a more pragmatic view of its contribution to natural capital is justified. This article takes an objective look at the capacity for macroalgae to fill a global carbon sequestration niche, both as managed natural carbon pools and as deployable carbon capture assets.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract  Increased intensity of extreme climatic events and natural hazards, combined with sea level rise due to global warming, has increased the vulnerability of nearshore and coastal regions to extreme flooding and erosion. The existing hard-engineered infrastructures for flood protection are mainly built from concrete with very high carbon emissions throughout their life cycle. In recent years, the application of nature-based solutions to tackle adverse climatic events has received attention. Nearshore vegetations such as salt marshes and mangroves have proven to attenuate incoming wave energy, thereby reducing wave runup and overtopping at coastal defences. The effectiveness of seagrass vegetation on wave runup attenuation remains less studied. The aim of this physical modelling study was to investigate the performance of prototype seagrass vegetations on wave runup reductions, for a wide range of wave conditions. Results of this study showed that the seagrass vegetation was effective in reducing wave runup on a ‘bare’ beach. It was found that the location of the vegetation patch within the surfzone and inner-surf zone can play a key role in wave energy dampening. The vegetation type, and packing density also play a significant role in determining the effectiveness of seagrass in wave energy mitigation.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract  Ecosystems like coral reefs mitigate rising coastal flood risks, but investments into their conservation remain low relative to the investments into engineered risk-mitigation structures. One reason is that quantifying the risk-reduction benefits of coral reefs requires an estimate of their fragility to severe stresses. Engineered structures typically have associated fragility functions which predict the probability of exceeding a damage state with the increasing loading intensity imposed by a stressor, like a hurricane. Here, we propose a preliminary framework for capturing the fragility of coral reefs towards hurricanes in an analogous way to that of an engineered structure. We base our framework on Disturbance Response Monitoring data collected in the Florida Keys and Puerto Rico following Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We first establish a qualitatively consistent correlation between hurricane impacts and coral mortality rates using two surveys of coral health. We focus specifically on stony coral mortality as a metric for reef damage, simplifying the effect of coral morphology into a single quantitative index at the site scale. To quantify the loading intensity of a hurricane, we propose a Hurricane Wind Exposure Time that captures spatial variations in the exposure of different coral reef sites to hurricane force winds. We ultimately derive a simple empirical fragility function for the Florida Keys and Puerto Rico to support side-by-side comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of a coral reef and engineered solutions to flood risk reduction in these regions.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract  Climate-related risks in Central and South America have received increased attention and concern in science and policy, but an up-to-date comprehensive review and synthesis of risks and adaptation potential is currently missing. For this paper we evaluated over 200 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents published since 2012. We found that climate change in Central and South America during the 21st century may increase the risk to severe levels for the following topical risk clusters: (a) Food insecurity; (b) Floods and landslides; (c) Water scarcity; (d) Epidemics of vector-borne diseases; (e) Amazon Forest biome shift; (f). Coral bleaching; (g) Coastal risks of sea level rise, storm surges and erosion; (h) Systemic failure due to cascading impacts of hazards and epidemics. Our synthesis also identified feasible adaptation measures for each risk. The impacts of the risks will be heterogeneous throughout the region, with rural communities, Indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, women, disabled people, and migrants identified as being the most severely affected. We refer to a number of adaptation options for each risk. However, unabated climate change together with low adaptive capacity will strictly limit adaptation options. Immediate strengthening of policies for building adaptive capacity and increase of research on the risk-adaptation nexus in Central and South America are paramount. Our findings might contribute to guide the adjustment and emphasis of adaptation policies and climate risk management strategies from local to national level.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract  As storm-driven coastal flooding increases under climate change, wetlands such as saltmarshes are held as a nature-based solution. Yet evidence supporting wetlands’ storm protection role in estuaries—where both waves and upstream surge drive coastal flooding—remains scarce. Here we address this gap using numerical hydrodynamic models within eight contextually diverse estuaries, simulating storms of varying intensity and coupling flood predictions to damage valuation. Saltmarshes reduced flooding across all studied estuaries and particularly for the largest—100 year—storms, for which they mitigated average flood extents by 35% and damages by 37% ($8.4 M). Across all storm scenarios, wetlands delivered mean annual damage savings of $2.7 M per estuary, exceeding annualised values of better studied wetland services such as carbon storage. Spatial decomposition of processes revealed flood mitigation arose from both localised wave attenuation and estuary-scale surge attenuation, with the latter process dominating: mean flood reductions were 17% in the sheltered top third of estuaries, compared to 8% near wave-exposed estuary mouths. Saltmarshes therefore play a generalised role in mitigating storm flooding and associated costs in estuaries via multi-scale processes. Ecosystem service modelling must integrate processes operating across scales or risk grossly underestimating the value of nature-based solutions to the growing threat of storm-driven coastal flooding.</jats:p>

AB  - A recent global review on the impacts of climate change on mangroves concluded that different regions will experience varying degrees of impacts due to the variability of expected changes in climate (shifts in precipitation, frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, sea level rise, change of ocean currents, increases in CO2 concentrations, etc.) and the variety of types and mangrove assemblages growing in these regions, including different species composition of mangrove forests. In North America and the Caribbean, these changes are dependent upon a predicted higher frequency (and intensity) of tropical storms, sea level rise, changes in patterns of precipitation, and higher temperatures. Located at the land-sea interface, mangroves in this region are expected to expand their ranges poleward (towards North Florida), or migrate into other coastal ecosystems (e.g., the Everglades), provided no natural or urban center barriers are present to prevent this expansion. If rains increase, as is anticipated, along the United States-Mexico border, mangroves may likely begin to thrive in places currently occupied by unvegetated salt flats. However, a lack of rain may also be of benefit in areas such as Louisiana where marsh diebacks have been linked to droughts, which directly increases the likelihood of mangrove migrations into these ecosystems.

Existing frameworks describing the use of NBS to address urban challenges do not specifically consider circularity challenges. Thus, the new framework provides the following: (1) a comprehensive set of Urban Circularity Challenges (UCCs); (2) a set of more than fifty NBS units and NBS interventions thoroughly assessed in terms of their potential to address UCCs; and (3) an analysis of input and output resource streams, which are both required for and produced during operation of NBS.

AB  - A major obstacle to mapping Ecosystem Services (ES) and the application of the ES concept has been the inadequacy of data at the landscape level necessary for their quantification. This study takes advantage of the free satellite imagery to map and provide relevant information regarding the ES and contributing to the sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries. This study aims to assess the flow of ES in the mangrove ecosystem of Ungwana Bay on the Northern coast of Kenya, by adopting the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) matrix approach. The study characterized the LULC classes present in the study area, identified the most important ES, and collected data on expert opinions via a survey on ES flow supplied by the mangrove ecosystem. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the expert scoring produced a LULC matrix that when integrated with the LULC maps showed the spatial distribution of ES flow. The assessment indicates very high flow (5.0) for the regulating and supporting services, high flow (4.0) for the cultural services and medium flow (3.0) for the provisioning services as supplied by mangroves. In addition, the analysis indicates there are sixteen (16) major ES supplied by the mangrove ecosystem of Ungwana bay as per the year 2021. This study highlights the importance of the mangroves as a coastal ecosystem and how the visualization of the spatial distribution of ES flow using maps can be useful in informing natural resource management. In addition, the study shows the possibilities of using freely accessible satellite imagery and software’s to help the ES assessment studies lacking in developing countries.

AB  - A living shoreline (LS) is defined as an estuarine shoreline stabilization approach that primarily utilizes native shoreline habitats and preserves the natural land–water interface. This chapter describes the ability of natural fringing salt marshes to attenuate wave energy, trap sediment, and reduce shoreline erosion. It summarizes the adverse impacts of hardened stabilization structures such as bulkheads and revetments on ecosystem structure and function, including marsh vegetation and faunal utilization, as well as their reduced resilience to sea level rise (SLR) and coastal storms. A review of studies assessing LS projects shows that measures of ecosystem services, including erosion protection, sediment accretion, marsh production, carbon sequestration, and faunal utilization, can equal or exceed those of natural shoreline habitats within five years of establishment. Salt marshes, seagrasses, and oyster reefs are utilized in the LS projects reviewed. Widespread implementation of LS may be limited by regulatory policy and public perceptions. Habitat trade-offs and limited long-term protection from SLR are described.

AB  - A growing suite of research has demonstrated that nature-based shoreline stabilization methods can increase resilience of coastal ecosystems by improving their capacity to return to predisturbance states. Previous work suggests that during hurricanes, living shorelines promote vertical accretion and experience less damage than traditional shoreline stabilization alternatives. Nevertheless, there is limited research looking at the impacts of major storm events on living shorelines and most studies have investigated a small number of sites. This study used in situ real-time kinematic (RTK)-GPS surveys to quantify the resilience (via the lateral change in shore position) of 17 living shoreline sites before and after a Category 1 hurricane event (Hurricane Florence, 2018). By doing so, this study seeks to understand the capacity of living shorelines (marsh with seaward breakwater or sill) to provide storm protection as compared to unaltered natural fringing salt marshes. After Hurricane Florence, living shorelines on average experienced significantly less lateral erosion compared to unprotected control segments (shoreline change rates of 0.015 and -0.31 m year-1 , respectively). This study also explores how environmental siting variables (i.e., scarp presence, fetch, and bottom sediment) and sill design variables (i.e., sill material, width, and height) influence short- and long-term erosion. living shorelines were found to reduce erosion of fringing marsh edge among projects with a range of installation ages, structural materials, sill widths, and sill heights, and they were able to provide protection from erosion across a range of fetch, scarp, and bottom sediment conditions. Living shoreline siting and sill design may be suitable for broader environmental conditions than previously known. This study shows that living shorelines can increase resilience by reducing erosion of fringing salt marshes, promoting lateral building up of shoreline zones during short-term disturbance events, and from their long-term presence.

AB  - A growing interest in nature-based solutions has gained unprecedented attention in the coastal risk management, to complement or replace conventional approaches like hard structures (dykes, seawalls, breakwaters). However, due to the diversity of coastal ecosystems and the heterogeneity of the ecosystem service of wave attenuation they can induce, the integration of their protective role in an accurate way into risk studies remains rare. This paper shows an experimental methodology to integrate this ecosystem service into the risk mapping at very high spatial resolution using in situ sensors, airborne LiDAR and spaceborne satellite imagery. Risk study is achieved using a combination of indices which allows to evaluate the asset's exposure and vulnerability. The nature-based solution is also integrated through the creation of an adaptive capacity index, based on a spatially-explicit model of wave attenuation. The study enables to highlight the assets which are the most concerned by the marine flooding risk, using a synthetic risk index ranging from 0 to 1.

AB  - A full consideration of ecosystem services (ES) impacts, interactions and improvements can result in more sustainable and adaptive solutions for dredging and marine construction projects. Furthermore, the benefits can be translated in monetary terms, providing returns on investment and highlighting the links between ecology and economy. For some however, the ES concept is too theoretical. This article seeks to show how the ES concept can actively be applied at any point during a project and the benefits of doing so. Its purpose is to provide a framework for integrated and interdisciplinary thinking throughout the different steps of the project cycle.

AB  - A broad marine management goal is to maintain healthy marine social–ecological systems that sustain desirable marine ecosystem services (MES) and have the capacity to adapt to change. Models, as representations of how systems work, are promising tools for understanding marine ecosystem and socio-economic processes (Addison et al. 2017; Zedler, 2017). Marine models can translate alternative scenarios exploring the projected consequences on marine ecosystem function of possible futures for drivers of change such as greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions, coastal development, and market, political and socio-cultural forces on seafood consumption (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), 2005; Inniss et al. 2016; Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), 2016; Katona et al. 2017). They can also help decision-makers to evaluate national or local scenarios examining the effectiveness of alternative past or future policy interventions influencing society’s demand for specific ES and their delivery to society (Guerry et al., 2012; IPBES, 2016; Arkema et al., 2017).

AB  - 1. Seagrasses are declining globally, and effective restoration actions to promote the recovery of degraded meadows are urgently needed. Harnessing positive plant interactions during early life stages is considered a valuable strategy to improve terrestrial and coastal habitat restoration. Yet, its application to seagrass restoration is still in infancy, and very little is known on the role played by biotic interactions in shaping newly established populations. We assessed the feasibility of manipulating intraspecific and interspecific plant interactions to enhance seed-based restoration success using the seagrass Posidonia oceanica as a model. Specifically, we investigated in mesocosm whether seed germination increased with increasing seed density and whether increasing seedling density and planting a pioneer seagrass promoted facilitation among seedlings. To do this, seedlings were grown either as a single individual or in clumps of medium and high density, with and without Cymodocea nodosa, for 2 years encompassing their most critical growth stage. Germination of P. oceanica seeds was not affected by seed density. Posidonia oceanica seedlings planted at medium and high density showed higher survival than those planted individually but only in the presence of C. nodosa. Seedlings planted at medium and at high density with C. nodosa performed better than those grown at low density or without C. nodosa due to a positive joint effect of intraspecific and interspecific interaction. Cymodocea nodosa plants grown with P. oceanica seedlings at high density were larger than those grown alone, indicating a mutualistic relationship. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that in seagrasses positive interactions during early life stages can be promoted by planting seedlings in dense clumps in association with an early successional species. The incorporation of this novel nature-based approach in seed-based restoration could accelerate the recolonization of degraded seagrass habitats. In planning future seed-based restoration interventions, managers should assess both intraspecific and interspecific interactions established by seedlings of target species for identifying proper planting density/spatial configuration and potential benefactor species promoting facilitative mechanisms to maximize seedling planting success.

AB  - <AbstractText>Coastal cities are under severe threat from the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, coastal inundation, and ecosystem degradation. It is well known that the ocean, and in particular coastal environments, have been changing at an unprecedented rate, which poses increasing risks to people in small island developing states, such as Fiji. The Greater Suva Urban Area, the capital and largest metropolitan area of Fiji, is expected to be largely impacted by climate-related risks to its socio-economic, cultural, and political positions. In the face of these threats, creating a resilient city that can withstand and adapt to the impacts of climate change and promote sustainable development should be guided by a holistic approach, encompassing stakeholders from the government, the private sector, civil society organizations, and international institutions. This study assesses the risk profile of Suva city using an innovative risk information tool, the climate and ocean risk vulnerability index (CORVI), which applies structured expert judgment to quantify climate-related risks in data-sparse environments. Through comparative quantification of diverse risk factors and narrative analysis, this study identifies three priority areas for Suva's future climate-resilient actions: development of climate risk-informed urban planning, harmonized urban development and natural restoration, and enhancing the climate resilience to the tourism sector.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=\"Supplementary Information\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11027-022-10043-4.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023, Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.</CopyrightInformation>

AB  - “Blue carbon” wetland vegetation has a limited freshwater requirement. One type, mangroves, utilizes less freshwater during transpiration than adjacent terrestrial ecoregions, equating to only 43% (average) to 57% (potential) of evapotranspiration (ET ). Here, we demonstrate that comparative consumptive water use by mangrove vegetation is as much as 2905 kL H2O ha−1 year−1 less than adjacent ecoregions with Ec -to-ET ratios of 47–70%. Lower porewater salinity would, however, increase mangrove Ec -to-ET ratios by affecting leaf-, tree-, and stand-level eco-physiological controls on transpiration. Restricted water use is also additive to other ecosystem services provided by mangroves, such as high carbon sequestration, coastal protection and support of biodiversity within estuarine and marine environments. Low freshwater demand enables mangroves to sustain ecological values of connected estuarine ecosystems with future reductions in freshwater while not competing with the freshwater needs of humans. Conservative water use may also be a characteristic of other emergent blue carbon wetlands.

AB  - ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, the Working Group II contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report presents a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge of the observed impacts and projected risks of climate change as well as the adaptation options. The report confirms the strong interactions of the natural, social and climate systems and that human-induced climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts to nature and people. It is clear that across sectors and regions, the most vulnerable people and systems are disproportionately affected and climate extremes have led to irreversible impacts. The assessment underscores the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C if we are to achieve a fair, equitable and sustainable world. While the assessment concluded that there are feasible and effective adaptation options which can reduce risks to nature and people, it also found that there are limits to adaptation and that there is a need for increased ambition in both adaptation and mitigation. These and other findings confirm and enhance our understanding of the importance of climate resilient development across sectors and regions and, as such, demands the urgent attention of both policymakers and the general public.

AB  - Vegetated coastal and marine habitats in the Nordic region include salt marshes, eelgrass meadows and, in particular, brown macroalgae (kelp forests and rockweed beds). Such habitats contribute to storage of organic carbon (Blue Carbon – BC) and support coastal protection, biodiversity and water quality. Protection and restoration of these habitats therefore have the potential to deliver climate change mitigation and co-benefits. Here we present the existing knowledge on Nordic BC habitats in terms of habitat area, C-stocks and sequestration rates, co-benefits, policies and management status to inspire a coherent Nordic BC roadmap. The area extent of BC habitats in the region is incompletely assessed, but available information sums up to 1,440 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> salt marshes, 1,861 (potentially 2,735) km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> seagrass meadows, and 16,532 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (potentially 130,735 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, including coarse Greenland estimates) brown macroalgae, yielding a total of 19,833 (potentially 134,910) km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Saltmarshes and seagrass meadows have experienced major declines over the past century, while macroalgal trends are more diverse. Based on limited salt marsh data, sediment C-stocks average 3,311 g C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> (top 40-100 cm) and sequestration rates average 142 g C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Eelgrass C-stocks average 2,414 g C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> (top 25 cm) and initial data for sequestration rates range 5-33 g C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>, quantified for one Greenland site and one short term restoration. For Nordic brown macroalgae, peer-reviewed estimates of sediment C-stock and sequestration are lacking. Overall, the review reveals substantial Nordic BC-stocks, but highlights that evidence is still insufficient to provide a robust estimate of all Nordic BC-stocks and sequestration rates. Needed are better quantification of habitat area, C-stocks and fluxes, particularly for macroalgae, as well as identification of target areas for BC management. The review also points to directives and regulations protecting Nordic marine vegetation, and local restoration initiatives with potential to increase C-sequestration but underlines that increased coordination at national and Nordic scales and across sectors is needed. We propose a Nordic BC roadmap for science and management to maximize the potential of BC habitats to mitigate climate change and support coastal protection, biodiversity and additional ecosystem functions.</jats:p>

AB  - This study investigates the potential of a <jats:italic>Rhizophora</jats:italic> mangrove forest of moderate cross-shore thickness to attenuate wave heights using an idealized prototype-scale physical model constructed in a 104 m long wave flume. An 18 m long cross-shore transect of an idealized red mangrove forest based on the trunk-prop root system was constructed in the flume. Two cases with forest densities of 0.75 and 0.375 stems/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and a third baseline case with no mangroves were considered. LiDAR was used to quantify the projected area per unit height and to estimate the effective diameter of the system. The methodology was accurate to within 2% of the known stem diameters and 10% of the known prop root diameters. Random and regular wave conditions seaward, throughout, and inland of the forest were measured to determine wave height decay rates and drag coefficients for relative water depths ranging 0.36 to 1.44. Wave height decay rates ranged 0.008–0.021 m<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> for the high-density cases and 0.004–0.010 m<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> for the low-density cases and were found to be a function of water depth. Doubling the forest density increased the decay rate by a factor two, consistent with previous studies for other types of emergent vegetation. Drag coefficients ranged 0.4–3.8, and were found to be dependent on the Reynolds number. Uncertainty in the estimates of the drag coefficient due to the measured projected area and measured wave attenuation was quantified and found to have average combined standard deviations of 0.58 and 0.56 for random and regular waves, respectively. Two previous reduced-scale studies of wave attenuation by mangroves compared well with the present study when their Reynolds numbers were re-scaled by <jats:italic>λ<jats:sup>3/</jats:sup></jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> where λ is the prototype-to-model geometric scale ratio. Using the combined data sets, an equation is proposed to estimate the drag coefficient for a <jats:italic>Rhizophora</jats:italic> mangrove forest: <jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>D</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 0.6 + 3e04/<jats:italic>Re</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>DBH</jats:italic></jats:sub> with an uncertainty of 0.69 over the range 5e03 &amp;lt; <jats:italic>Re</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>DBH</jats:italic></jats:sub> &amp;lt; 1.9e05, where <jats:italic>Re</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>DBH</jats:italic></jats:sub> is based on the tree diameter at breast height.

AB  - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is one of the oldest conservation organizations in the United States and is the only federal agency solely charged with conserving fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats. The agency leads numerous conservation initiatives, such as protecting and recovering endangered species, managing almost 600 wildlife refuges throughout all states and territories, enforcing federal wildlife laws, and regulating international wildlife trade. In the past, these activities have not accounted for climate change. The accelerating biodiversity crisis, in combination with climate uncertainty, adds to the existing complexity associated with responding to multiple anthropogenic stressors. Here we describe current practice and thinking related to climate uncertainty and management of USFWS resources. We focus on three agency domains which represent various conservation planning responsibilities: evaluating species to be listed as threatened or endangered, Habitat Conservation Plans for listed species, and land management techniques on wildlife refuges. Integrating climate considerations into agency planning documents is complex and we highlight effective current applications and suggest future improvements. Additionally, we identify outstanding research needs or management applications, and updates to existing policy that will aid in developing improved conservation strategies. Our synthesis contributes to ongoing efforts to incorporate climate uncertainty into conservation planning, natural resource management, and related policy revisions.</jats:p>

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess existing conventional and hypothetical nature-based coastal-protection schemes using a comparative ecosystem service assessment, based on quantitative data and literature as well as on stakeholder views. We assessed three conventional groin systems and three building-with-nature scenarios including an expanded beach area, a mussel farm and seagrass beds. Stakeholders perceived the nature-based scenarios as positive and assumed an overall increase in the ecosystem service provision. The quantitative data-based approach showed similar results. Building-with-nature approaches were considered to provide economical and/or environmental benefits to human beings, beyond coastal protection and safety. Especially for the combination of coastal-protection measures with submerged vegetation in shallow waters, a strong increase in ecosystem service potential is assumed, e.g., on nature restoration as well as on touristic and landscape attractiveness. Our approach turned out to be suitable for assessing different coastal-protection scenarios with reasonable effort. Our methodology can help to catch the views of people, raise awareness on the multiple consequences of these measures and enable an improved and structured participatory dialogue with locals and stakeholders. Our approach may support coastal-protection planning and help to reduce local resistance against measures and their implementation.</jats:p>

For a better implementation of gray to green interventions in tidal inlets, their effectiveness and their effects on the velocity of these dynamic coastal systems need to be understood. The effects on flow velocity of gray to green coastal protection interventions for tidal inlets are assessed here by exploring six interventions intended to protect against erosion on the estuarine-side shoreline near the inlet. A field-calibrated numerical model with Willmott Skill scores rated as excellent for Oregon Inlet located in North Carolina, United States, is used to simulate tidal currents under present conditions and after implementing a seawall, a set of bendway weirs, a terminal groin extension, a dual-jetty system, a flood channel relocation, and an island restoration project. Comparisons of time series of flow velocities in the flood channel along an eroding, estuarine shoreline are used to identify the effectiveness of each coastal protection alternative at reducing erosive velocities. Geospatial difference maps are used to determine velocity changes caused by each alternative throughout the inlet system. With no coastal protection interventions, the velocities along the eroding shoreline exceeded an erosive threshold velocity (defined as 0.2 m/s) during 50% of the simulated period. Alternatives closer to the green side of the coastal protection intervention spectrum, such as channel relocation and island restoration, tend to display the most effectiveness at reducing flow velocities at the eroding shoreline while resulting in minimal inlet-wide hydrodynamic changes. On the other hand, gray alternatives either cause minimal (seawall and bendway weirs) or extreme (jetties) changes in velocities throughout the inlet system. This comparison of gray and green coastal protection interventions in tidal inlets serves as an example to contrast the effectiveness of different coastal protection alternatives at reducing erosive flow velocities and to inform alternative selection at other inlet systems.</jats:p>

AB  - Seagrasses represent an essential part of the coastal environment and are hence the target of many coastal restoration projects. Artificial seagrass (ASG) mats may facilitate seagrass growth, making them a captivating option for restoration projects. However, little is known about the forces occurring on mats deployed in marine environments and especially on how these forces are transmitted to the anchoring points. Here, we present a study of prototype biodegradable coconut-mesh mats as base layer for ASG meadows and investigate the forces that occur at the anchors. We test the performance of three mesh types under wave forcing using two different anchor configurations without ASG and subsequently test ASG mats of one mesh type under wave forcing and a 4-anchor configuration to assess the effect of the ASG on anchor loading as a function of incident orbital velocities. We found that the mat composition plays a more important role than the number of anchors in anchor load reduction. The anchor forces were 2–4 times higher at front anchors compared to rear anchors, relative to wave propagation direction, and were also considerably higher in that direction compared to the opposite direction. With ASG, the forces increased compared to the highest measured forces without ASG. The forces on the anchors were almost fully dominated by the drag on the ASG based on material properties, ASG reconfiguration and flow conditions. We derive a relation between horizontal orbital velocities and expected forcing on the anchor based on ASG properties and the corresponding area of each anchor and discuss relevant criteria for the design of ASG mats. This should help to assess the loading on anchors deployed for restoration under specific site conditions and chosen materials.</jats:p>

AB  - Restoring degraded and damaged salt marshes has become an important initiative in the coastal wetlands management around the world. Evaluating the economic output of salt marsh restoration is of great significance for identifying the current state of knowledge gaps related to conservation activities and economic benefits. To address this question, we conducted an overview of global salt marsh restoration projects, and their financial expenses and restoration benefits in the past 40 years. The results showed that most of the saltmarsh restoration projects are near megacities and larger rivers, and restoration techniques of different regions depend on the types of disturbance factors such as climate change, extreme weather events, and land use change. With limited resources, fund allocation between protected areas and unprotected areas in middle-income countries is often unbalanced, indicating a mismatch between conservation efforts and regional needs. Although restoration projects are expensive, the evidence in this article implies that most salt marsh restoration projects could recover their financial expense in the finite time, especially for large-scale restoration activities. Besides, the great carbon sequestration potential would make salt marsh restoration projects more profitable under current efforts to promote carbon sequestration for combating global warming.</jats:p>

AB  - One of the currently promoted methods of counteracting climate change is nature-based climate solutions, which harness the power of nature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable management of ecosystems is a guarantee for sustained human well-being. This underestimated, but extremely efficient and cheap method of integrating nature resources into the urban fabric is an economic “injection” for communal authorities. These “green” benefits should be standard in land-use planning in the era of anthropocentrism. Solutions based on nature were the reason for investigating their perception by Polish municipalities. The survey covered the entire country (all 2477 municipalities) from 20 July to 31 August 2021 through an electronic survey, obtaining 2128 responses (85.9% return rate). In the final result, data were obtained that support the hypotheses posed in the study. The main objective of the research was to check the level of activity of municipalities in Poland in the field of proecological activities using nature-based solutions (NbS). The survey results confirmed little knowledge of nature-based solutions, at the same time giving it an educational dimension. Half of the respondents declared that they learned about NbS only from the survey. Polish decision makers and municipal authorities introduce some solutions based on nature without being aware of their European classification and adequate nomenclature. Environmental awareness in Poland remains largely the domain of urban municipalities, with higher current budget revenues per capita and in the central and western parts of the country. NbS are marginal in rural municipalities, which can be explained by the lack of ecological specialists, less car traffic and more single-family houses and thus modest public areas. The following surveys covering the entire territory of Poland are the first to be carried out on such a large scale.</jats:p>

AB  - Natural and Nature-Based systems provide an opportunity for adaptive response to Coastal Storm Risk Management and Sea Level Rise. The Tigertail Lagoon/Sand Dollar Island Restoration on Marco Island, Florida, presents a case study designed to maintain and enhance an existing coastal barrier system consisting of a 3-km-long sand spit and tidal lagoon ecosystem that is otherwise evolving toward closure. The case study is part of a nature-based adaptive management plan to restore and stabilize the sandspit and tidal lagoon through cyclic use of sediment within the system. This approach seeks to preserve existing protective habitats and landforms that also serve as natural coastal barriers to protect upland development. Design of the restoration plan considers the functions of a wildlife nature preserve and evolution of complex tidal inlet morphologic features bordered by a heavily developed barrier Island. The design aims to restore and enhance a sandspit degraded by a sequence of storms since Major Hurricane Irma impacted Southwest Florida in 2017 and improve the existing deteriorated habitat by enhancing tidal exchange through restoration of the lagoon flow channel. Total wetland area will be increased by relocating the sand spit seaward of its present location to where it was located in approximately 2017. The reconstructed beach berm will provide enhanced resiliency to high frequency weather events. Sediment will be sourced from the existing sand spit and an innovative sand trap that will maintain the lagoon entrance open while providing beneficial re-use for excess sediment that continues to accumulate at the end of the spit. Components of the project were analyzed using existing engineering models and methods such as the Coastal Modeling System (CMS) and XBeach. Enhancing and preserving this barrier island feature and productive ecosystem provides an example of the enhanced coastal resiliency provided by natural and nature-based systems that are adaptable and responsive to sea level rise and ongoing coastal processes.</jats:p>

AB  - Natural and nature-based features (NNBF) have been used for more than 100 years as coastal protection infrastructure (e.g., beach nourishment projects). The application of NNBF has grown steadily in recent years with the goal of realizing both coastal engineering and environment and social co-benefits through projects that have the potential to adapt to the changing climate. Technical advancements in support of NNBF are increasingly the subject of peer-reviewed literature, and guidance has been published by numerous organizations to inform technical practice for specific types of nature-based solutions. The International Guidelines on Natural and Nature-Based Features for Flood Risk Management was recently published to provide a comprehensive guide that draws directly on the growing body of knowledge and practitioner experience from around the world to inform the process of conceptualizing, planning, designing, engineering, and operating NNBF. These Guidelines focus on the role of nature-based solutions and natural infrastructure (beaches, dunes, wetlands and plant systems, islands, reefs) as a part of coastal and riverine flood risk management. In addition to describing each of the NNBF types, their use, design, implementation, and maintenance, the guidelines describe general principles for employing NNBF, stakeholder engagement, monitoring, costs and benefits, and adaptive management. An overall systems approach is taken to planning and implementation of NNBF. The guidelines were developed to support decision-makers, project managers, and practitioners in conceptualizing, planning, designing, engineering, implementing, and maintaining sustainable systems for nature-based flood risk management. This paper summarizes key concepts and highlights challenges and areas of future research.</jats:p>

AB  - Momentum for sustainable and climate resilience solutions for coastal protection are growing globally given the pressing need to prevent further loss of biodiversity and ecosystems while meeting the climate change adaptation and mitigation goals. Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) represent an opportunity to align environmental and resilience goals, at a time of strained budgets in a global context and when short-term needs may run counter to long-term goals. In Europe, NbS fit the mandates of major EU environmental and climate change policies by restoring biodiversity and enhancing climate-resilience and carbon sequestration. Previous studies have compiled scientific evidence about hydro-meteorological hazards for the use of NbS. However, their implementation at scale is still lacking. As the knowledge and experience with NbS for adaptation to natural hazards and climate change increases, it becomes more important to draw lessons learned and insights for replicating and scaling up NbS, especially in coastal areas where their implementation is still limited compared to other environments. This study analyzed NbS case studies across European coastal and estuarine areas to draw key lessons, understand better the current status of implementation, and identify key challenges and gaps. From a total of 59 NbS case studies associated with flooding, erosion and biodiversity loss, results show an increase in NbS implementation since 1990s, but most rapidly between 2005 and 2015. Most of the case studies are hybrid solutions employing wetlands, predominantly located in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands. Funding of NbS is largely from public sources, and rarely come from a single or a private source. Three-quarters of the case studies reported monitoring activities, but more than half did not disclose quantitative results related to effectiveness against flooding and/or erosion. The need to improve coastal defenses was indicated as the main motivation for NbS implementation over traditional structures, while sustainability was the most mentioned additional reason. Although a variety of co-benefits and lessons learned was identified, clearer descriptions and enhanced details of such information are required. There is a need for tools and strategies to expand knowledge sharing of lessons learned to enable further replication of successful cases in other areas.</jats:p>

AB  - Mangroves provide valuable ecological and socio-economic services. The importance of mangroves is particularly evident in Southeast (SE) Asia where the most extensive and diverse forests are found. To recover degraded mangroves, several SE Asian countries have implemented restoration programs. However, to date, there has been no systematic and quantitative synthesis on mangrove restoration studies in the region. Here, we provide a bibliometric-based analysis of mangrove restoration to provide understanding on trends and future directions needed to meet biodiversity and restoration targets in the region. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, we analyzed 335 articles (249 articles with ecological attributes; 86 articles with social attributes) published until February 2022 from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Mangrove restoration studies with ecological and social attributes started around the early 1990s mostly from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Majority of SE Asian countries have stronger collaboration to western countries rather than within the region. Reasons for restoration vary per country, but mostly were intended to rehabilitate damaged mangroves. Direct planting was the most common restoration method used while hydrological rehabilitation was less practiced. Research on ecological attributes were dominated by biodiversity-related studies focused on flora and fauna, and less on other ecosystem services (e.g., coastal protection, fisheries production, etc.). Studies with social attributes only accounted for &amp;lt;30% of the publications, mostly on topics related to ecological economics. Although mangrove restoration studies are apparent, some thematic restoration foci are needed. We propose priority research topics to help achieve the biodiversity and restoration targets by 2030.</jats:p>

AB  - Mangroves are often cleared for aquaculture, agriculture, and coastal development despite the range of benefits for people and nature that they provide. In response to these losses, there are multiple global, and regional efforts aimed at accelerating mangrove forest restoration, resulting in many restoration projects being implemented and managed by different groups with highly diverse objectives. The information reported from these restoration projects is extremely variable, limiting our ability to identify whether desired objectives have been met or key factors that determine effective and durable restoration have been applied. To address this problem, we developed a holistic monitoring framework that captures the key indicators of restoration, spanning project aims, intervention type, costs, and ecological and socioeconomic outcomes. Subsequently, using a systematic literature search, we examined 123 published case studies to identify the range and quality of reported information on restoration, relative to our framework. We found that there were many gaps in reporting, for multiple indicators. Sections related to site conditions prior to restoration (reported in only 32% of case studies) and socioeconomic outcomes (26%) were consistently missing from most project reporting. Conversely, information on the type of intervention was reported for all case studies, and the aims of the project (reported in 76% of case studies) and ecological monitoring (82%) were far more prevalent. Generally, the restoration literature did not follow any specific framework in terms of reporting which likely contributed to the gaps in the information recorded. These gaps hinder comparisons between case studies, inhibiting the ability to learn lessons from previous restoration attempts by identifying commonalities. The need for more structure and consistent reporting supports the development of a standard restoration tracking tool that can facilitate the comparison of restoration efforts, aiding the implementation of future projects.</jats:p>

AB  - Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that accumulate and store large quantities of carbon in their sediments. Many recent studies and reviews have favorably identified the potential for such coastal “blue carbon” ecosystems to provide a natural climate solution in two ways: by conservation, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the loss and degradation of such habitats, and by restoration, to increase carbon dioxide drawdown and its long-term storage. The focus here is on the latter, assessing the feasibility of achieving quantified and secure carbon removal (negative emissions) through the restoration of coastal vegetation. Seven issues that affect the reliability of carbon accounting for this approach are considered: high variability in carbon burial rates; errors in determining carbon burial rates; lateral carbon transport; fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide; carbonate formation and dissolution; vulnerability to future climate change; and vulnerability to non-climatic factors. Information on restoration costs is also reviewed, with the conclusion that costs are highly uncertain, with lower-range estimates unrealistic for wider application. CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> removal using coastal blue carbon restoration therefore has questionable cost-effectiveness when considered only as a climate mitigation action, either for carbon-offsetting or for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions. Many important issues relating to the measurement of carbon fluxes and storage have yet to be resolved, affecting certification and resulting in potential over-crediting. The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is nevertheless highly advantageous for climate adaptation, coastal protection, food provision and biodiversity conservation. Such action can therefore be societally justified in very many circumstances, based on the multiple benefits that such habitats provide at the local scale.</jats:p>

By fitting boosted regression trees to the compiled data, we modelled and predicted the distribution of kelp forests across the Nordic region. Despite the large scale of the analyses, the models captured well the kelps’ environmental affinities and predicted the presence of kelp forests with high accuracy. Dense kelp forests are found along the rocky shores of all the Nordic countries, except in the brackish Baltic Sea, with largest areas in Norway, Greenland and Iceland. The results of this study set the scene for future studies on the importance of kelp forests in the Nordic region, including their contribution to the marine carbon budget.</jats:p>

AB  - Investigation of the effectiveness of Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) for protecting shorelines from ship wake is increasingly important with continued development along the coast, especially when combined with sea level rise. Studies that investigate the wave energy dissipation capacity of different techniques and account for variation in context will lead to improvements and innovation in designed NNBF. Few studies have examined the performance of NNBF in protecting shorelines from ship wake. In this study of a low-sloping estuarine shoreline adjacent to a major shipping route, a natural design using coir logs and wooden staking was implemented in a T-head groin configuration. Pressure transducers and electromagnetic current meters were deployed over ∼1.5 months to investigate the energy dissipation and velocity attenuation capabilities of the installation. Results indicate that ship wakes account for 25%–50% of the total daily energy impacting the shoreline at the study site. Peak background velocities are typically over 50% smaller than the largest ship wake velocities. Field data and results of the fully nonlinear Boussinesq model, FUNWAVE-TVD, indicate that the installation is capable of decreasing energy impacting the shoreline by 10%–80% and is effective over the lower 50% of the tidal range and when submerged up to twice its height. Elevation surveys of the site indicate accrual of sediment within the installation, suggesting wave diffraction patterns promoting further accretion at the site over time. Observations indicate that coir logs may be effective in reducing wave energy from ship wakes but may fail under storm conditions in a moderate fetch confined channel. Findings from this study illustrate the opportunities and challenges nature-based solutions face in addressing ship wakes, and their ability to protect shorelines under high energy stressors.</jats:p>

AB  - Intertidal salt marshes provide a range of valuable ecosystem services which typically increase with marsh width. Understanding the drivers for salt marsh expansion versus retreat is thus key to managers. Previous research highlights the influence of short-term (daily/event) bed level dynamics on germination and establishment and subsequent vegetation presence. However, more recent literature suggests the importance of medium-term seasonal bed level dynamics on viable seed availability and subsequent vegetation presence. This study aims to assess event-based and seasonal bed level dynamics for vegetation presence in natural and semi-natural salt marshes and to provide generic thresholds for vegetation presence. To gain insight into bed level dynamics, data was used from autonomous Optical and Acoustic Surface Elevation Dynamics sensors (O-SED and A-SED) around the edge of natural and semi-natural salt marshes. Sensors were installed at vegetated and unvegetated measurement station Field observations from 22 O-SEDs deployed at 4 well-established natural salt marshes in the Western Scheldt estuary and 4 O-SEDs at a well-established semi-natural salt marsh in the Wadden Sea were reanalyzed. Six novel A-SEDs were deployed at a pioneer semi-natural salt marsh in the Ems-Dollard Estuary. The measurement duration at all salt marshes was at least 1 year. The A-SED sensor was successfully validated against manual measurements. Furthermore, vegetation data and water level data were obtained. No significant difference was observed between natural and semi-natural salt marshes. However, a significant difference between vegetated and unvegetated measurement stations for short-term bed level dynamics was observed. Vegetation was found to be present at locations restricted by short-term bed level variability smaller than or equal to 12 mm, emphasizing the presence of a short-term threshold. Although trends in the non-growing season were significantly different between vegetated and unvegetated stations, seasonal thresholds for vegetation presence were not found. The findings imply that knowledge of bed level-dynamics in well-established natural marshes can be used to predict vegetation presence in constructed semi-natural marshes. The importance of local short-term dynamics for vegetation presence instead of longer-term dynamics highlights possibilities for developing favorable conditions for vegetation presence in marsh restoration projects and the construction of new salt marsh ecosystems.</jats:p>

AB  - Hurricanes have large and lasting effects along coastlines, representing one of the deadliest and costliest natural hazards. Among the rapidly growing literature on the impacts of hurricanes, an increasing topic of interest is the potential role of mangroves, and other coastal habitats, as nature-based strategies (NBS) for coastal defense. In addition to coastal protection, NBS have been shown to provide many ecological, economic, and social co-benefits. However, few studies have assessed coastal resident perceptions or residential-scale performance of NBS, particularly in the wake of major hurricanes. Through a survey of 288 residents of the Lower Florida Keys 1 year after Hurricane Irma, this paper describes hurricane impacts on mangroves, beaches, and hardened shorelines. Specifically, we measured perceptions of shoreline damage and shoreline effectiveness for coastal protection at the community- and parcel-levels. At the parcel scale, we also measured performance outcomes through the cost to repair or replace residential shorelines. At both community- and parcel-levels, beaches were perceived as the most damaged shoreline type, followed by mangroves, and then hardened shorelines as the least damaged. Specifically at the parcel-level, repair actions were not taken by many residents with a hardened shoreline (43.2%) due to their shoreline receiving no damage. However, when repair actions were taken, the average cost to repair or replace parcel-level mangroves ($64.33 (USD) <jats:inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m1\"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></jats:inline-formula> SE 58.08 per meter) was less than hardened shorelines ($105.14 (USD) <jats:inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m2\"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></jats:inline-formula> SE 38.57 per meter). Additionally, 44% of residents reported that no repair or recovery actions were needed after the storm for damaged mangroves, whereas when hardened structures were damaged, many required at least minor repairs (29.5%). Mangroves were also perceived as the most effective shoreline for storm protection (54% <jats:italic>very</jats:italic> to <jats:italic>extremely effective</jats:italic>) at the community-level. Our findings indicate local community-level awareness of the storm protective properties mangroves provide but also display a disconnect between perceptions and performance outcomes at parcel scales. Although mangroves cost less to repair and are perceived as the most effective at storm protection, the majority of Florida Keys residents own hardened shorelines. Considering the diverse co-benefits mangroves provide and the local support mangroves have, their conservation and restoration could be well-supported for coastal adaptation.</jats:p>

AB  - Coastlines are subject to multiple developments related to land use planning and the effects of climate change. These developments generally lead to an increase in the risk of coastal flooding. This article focuses on systems to protect against this hazard, and presents a bibliographical analysis on methods and operational tools to strengthen their resilience. This analysis is carried out by considering that a system of protection is a component of the territory to which it provides protection and that it is therefore necessary to study in depth the relations between this system and the various components of the territory (the natural environment, the built environment and the social and institutional environment). Based on this hypothesis, the concepts of risk and resilience applied to floods are specified and the protection and adaptation strategies commonly used in recent decades are described. This retrospective on concepts and strategies leads us to structure the state-of-the-art analysis on methods and operational tools in relation to two issues: 1) understanding risks; 2) adapting and transforming protection systems. In each case, the use of the concept of resilience implies a clear distinction between systemic and analytical approaches. Finally, this bibliographical analysis reveals the need to revise the protection system concept in order to promote the integration of these systems in the territories. Accordingly, new methodological developments could be considered using ecosystem and socio-economic approaches.</jats:p>

AB  - Coastal seascapes are productive and diverse land-sea systems that provide many valuable benefits yet are increasingly threatened by human activity. Scaling up of nature-based solutions (NbS) to effectively protect, sustainably manage, and restore coastal seascapes is urgently required for mitigation of climate change and biodiversity loss while also providing socio-economic benefits. Evidence-based site selection is an important first step to improve the outcomes and avoid negative impacts when prioritizing NbS investments at national level. We developed a spatially explicit, integrative and culturally relevant ecosystem-based site selection process to identify a portfolio of seascapes for NbS consideration in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The primary goal was to rank planning units based on potential for climate change mitigation action, positive impact to biodiversity and socio-economic benefits to people. The multi-criteria site-selection framework provided a rapid, transparent, repeatable and scalable tool. The highest weightings were assigned to blue carbon storage value, biodiversity conservation features, and local stakeholder preferred areas. Spatial proxies for benefits to people were represented by population density and accessibility to coastal seascapes, relative tourism and recreation potential, and importance of fish habitat and fishing grounds for food security. Participatory mapping of local knowledge and review of existing data ensured that both qualitative and quantitative criteria were reliable, up-to-date and locally relevant. Two distinct clusters of high suitability planning units were identified in the Abu Dhabi region and four along the north-western coast of the UAE. Most high suitability sites were located outside of existing marine protected areas. Alternative spatial scenarios without stakeholder bias underscored the suitability of sites identified through participatory mapping and highlighted additional priority sites for future scaling-up of NbS. A spatial corridor of medium and high suitability planning units across the region offers potential for designing well-connected NbS investments to accelerate and boost synergistic outcomes and increase resilience. The site selection framework provides a rapid tool that integrates local and global open access data at a range of scales with great potential for transferability to other regions worldwide.</jats:p>

AB  - Coastal erosion poses an urgent threat to life and property in low-lying regions. Sand nourishment is increasingly used as a nature-based solution but requires significant natural resources and replenishment over time. In this study, a novel form of nourishment is explored that combines shoreface nourishment and seagrass restoration to mitigate coastal erosion (i.e., green nourishment). Using the coastal morphodynamic model Xbeach, the impact of seagrass planting on wave energy dissipation, sediment erosion and transport, and morphological evolution of a cross-shore profile was studied for mild wave conditions and an intense storm. Model results indicate that a seagrass meadow enhances the wave energy dissipation provided by a shoreface nourishment, and suggests that it may be particularly effective in sediment transport mitigation when implemented in a sheltered nearshore area. The shoreface nourishment reduced the wave height on the seagrass meadow, and reduced the rate of seagrass destruction by deposition or erosion above the grass height after the storm event. Green nourishment also reduced beach foreshore erosion caused by a simulated storm event. An alternative, more cost-effective planting technique using seagrass seeds was explored, which showed similar coastal erosion protection benefits for seagrass transplants. This modeling study found that green nourishment is potentially an effective nature-based solution for coastal erosion and flooding on sandy coasts, and future studies are recommended to evaluate its morphological, ecological and flood risk reduction benefits in the field.</jats:p>

AB  - As coastal communities grow more vulnerable to sea-level rise and increased storminess, communities have turned to nature-based solutions to bolster coastal resilience and protection. Marshes have significant wave attenuation properties and can play an important role in coastal protection for many communities. Many restoration projects seek to maximize this ecosystem service but how much marsh restoration is enough to deliver measurable coastal protection benefits is still unknown. This question is critical to guiding assessments of cost effectiveness and for funding, implementation, and optimizing of marsh restoration for risk reduction projects. This study uses SWAN model simulations to determine empirical relationships between wave attenuation and marsh vegetation. The model runs consider several different common marsh morphologies (including systems with channels, ponds, and fringing mudflats), vegetation placement, and simulated storm intensity. Up to a 95% reduction in wave energy is seen at as low as 50% vegetation cover. Although these empirical relationships between vegetative cover and wave attenuation provide essential insight for marsh restoration, it is also important to factor in lifespan estimates of restored marshes when making overall restoration decisions. The results of this study are important for coastal practitioners and managers seeking performance goals and metrics for marsh restoration, enhancement, and creation.</jats:p>

AB  - As a “marine ecological engineer”, the oyster reefs not only perform important ecological functions, but also reduce the damage caused by waves to protective structures such as seawalls. However, oyster reefs in shallow water change the nonlinear characteristics of waves and affect sediment transport and coastal evolution. Based on Fourier spectrum and analysis of Wavelet Transform, the influence of artificial bag oyster reefs on the energy and nonlinear phase coupling of irregular waves are studied through physical experiment. The results show that oyster reefs have a substantial effect on the energy of primary harmonic, which transfer to higher harmonics through triad interactions, and a considerable reduction in primary harmonic energy and an increase in higher harmonics energy are reflected in the energy spectra. The transmission spectrum behind the oyster reefs shows three peaks at primary, secondary and third harmonics. The bicoherence spectrum indicates that the peaks at secondary and third harmonics mainly result from the self-coupling of the primary harmonics and phase coupling between the primary and secondary harmonics respectively. As the water depth increases, the degree of nonlinear coupling between wave components decreases, which leads to the energy of wave components at different frequencies increases. With increasing top width, the length of the shoaling region increases, and the growth of triad nonlinear interactions are observed in wavelet-based bicoherence spectra, resulting in the spectral peak energy decreasing while the secondary harmonics energy increasing in the spectrum. Finally, the potential application of an ecological system composed by “oyster reefs + mangroves” is discussed. As the effect of water depth on wave energy is much greater than that of top width, in artificial oyster reef construction, it is recommended that keep the oyster reefs non-submerged in terms of wave dissipation. Further studies should take the dynamic growth effect of oyster reefs into account.</jats:p>

AB  - 	Coastal protection measures and management play an important role in coping with coastal disasters and climate-induced sea-level rise. In this study, the success and failure of typical coastal protection works of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) are reported and documented from feld observations over a study period of 10–15 years. The coastal protection structures evaluated include revetments, geotubes, t-shaped bamboo fences, Pile-rock breakwaters, Busadco’s breakwaters, Semi-Circular breakwaters, and Hollow triangle breakwaters. This paper brieﬂy reviews the current situation of coastline erosion problem and accretion in the VMD and illustrates the severity of the current erosion rate that threatens the safety of coastal communities. The paper then evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various coastal management approaches currently in practice in the VMD to classify different types of possible measures for coastal management with the aim to fnd holistic measures for planning which require low construction investment. Integrated coastal management and planning are outlined at a regional scale followed by the lessons learned from the previous coastal protection works, and fnally the multiple lines of defense (MLD) solution is proposed, which is a green infrastructure inspired nature-based solution. The MLD solution can improve biodiversity, facilitate mangrove forest restoration, and ensure sustainable livelihoods for local communities. Integrated coastal planning and management solutions that are based on the MLD principle are expected to withstand coastal disasters under future climate change, and sea-level rise on the VMD.
