Wildfires cause loss of lives, economic losses, expose people to personal as well as collective trauma, and compromise the mental health of survivors. Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent following a traumatic event; however, their prevalence is not well established amongst those confronted by natural disasters such as wildfires. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the empirical findings pertaining to wildfires and the prevalence of sleep disturbances in the general community affected by this natural disaster. We searched EBSCO, PsychINFO, Medline, SpringerLink, CINAHL Complete, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library between January 2012 and March 2021. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings from this systematic review suggest that sleep disturbances, assessed one to ten months following the fires, are highly prevalent in wildfire survivors, with insomnia (ranging between 63-72.5%) and nightmares (ranging between 33.3-46.5%), being the most prevalent sleep disturbances reported in this cohort. Results also highlight the significant associations between sleep disturbances and post-traumatic symptoms following the trauma of wildfires. There is a possible link between sleep disturbance prevalence, severity of, and proximity to fires.","10.3390/ijerph181910152","1660-4601","","International journal of environmental research and public health","19","10152","1660-4601",""

A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future. Method: We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research. Results: We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. EPA regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity. Conclusion: Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Studies predominantly focused on mental health (21 studies, 58.33%), while evidence on long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on health outcomes other than mental health is limited. Current evidence indicated that long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure were associated with mortality (COVID-19 mortality, cardio-vascular disease mortality and acute myocardial disease mortality), morbidity (mainly respiratory diseases), mental health disorders (mainly posttraumatic stress disorder), shorter height of children, reduced lung function and poorer general health status.

Wildfire smoke contains numerous hazardous air pollutants and many studies have documented population health effects from this exposure. Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and to identify susceptible populations. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings. Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure. Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association with all-cause mortality. More research is needed to clarify which causes of mortality may be associated with wildfire smoke, whether cardiovascular outcomes are associated with wildfire smoke, and if certain populations are more susceptible.","10.1289/ehp.1409277","0091-6765 and 1552-9924","","Environmental health perspectives","9","1334","0091-6765 and 1552-9924",""

Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively. Results: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM2.5 (n = 2), PM10 (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth.

However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents.Recent FindingsWe searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM2.5 during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05-1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst - 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, - 32.92 to - 10.50) per 10 mu g/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM2.5/all-source PM2.5 during wildfire event.SummaryThe majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions.","10.1007/s40572-023-00420-9","2196-5412","","Current Environmental Health Reports","1","46","2196-5412",""

Systems dynamics is an adequate focus to analyze the mobilization of Hg due to wildfires, which meets all the requirements to be studied by multimedia modelling. The development and application for the first time of a dynamic multimedia model of Hg taking into account specifically the influences of wildfires is one of the novelties of this work. Different scenarios show that an increase in the number of fires will consequently increase the mercury emitted into the atmosphere, modifying its natural cycle, producing a long-term modification of Hg compositions and concentrations in the different media. Hg movement caused by wildfires can cause complications in living beings and alter the ecosystems. This study found that the Hg soil content could as well be an indicator to measure the impact of fire on the environment. This model can also be generalized to conduct additional studies under comparable conditions, helping to understand the importance of forest fires in global Hg cycles.","10.1007/s10661-022-10208-3","0167-6369 and 1573-2959","","ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT","10","","0167-6369 and 1573-2959",""

Therefore, the present review aims at collecting and analyzing integrated modeling approaches in estimating forest fire danger, examining the driving factors, and evaluating their influence on fire occurrence. The main objective is to propose the top performing methods and the most important risk factors for the development of an Integrated Wildfire Danger Risk System (IWDRS). Studies were classified based on the applied technique, i.e., geographic information systems, remote sensing, statistics, machine learning, simulation modeling and miscellaneous techniques. The conclusions of each study concerning the relative importance of model input variables are also reported. Online search engines such as 'Scopus', 'Google Scholar', 'WorldWideScience', 'ScienceDirect' and 'ResearchGate' were used in relevant literature searches published in scientific journals, manuals and technical documentation. A total of 230 studies were gathered with a selected subset being evaluated in a meta-analysis process. Machine learning techniques outperform average classic statistics, although their predictability relies heavily on the quantity and the quality of the input data. Geographic information systems and remote sensing are considered valuable yet supplementary tools. Modeling techniques apply best to fire behavior prediction, while other techniques refer-enced in the current review are potentially useful but further investigation is needed. In conclusion, wildfire danger is a function of seven thematic groups of variables: meteorology, vegetation, topography, hydrology, socio-economy, land use and climate. Ninety-five explanatory drivers are proposed.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165704","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

Here, we analyzed 143 sets of previously published data to evaluate the concentrations and composition profiles of PAHs in ash and soils associated with forest fires and to assess the impacts of soil depth, fire intensity, post-fire duration, and vegetation type on their occurrence. Compared to unburned soils, the total PAH concentrations increased by 205% (95% confidential interval of 152-269%; n = 136) in soils associated with fires. This increase surpassed that of PAH toxic equivalents (73%) because fires produce dominantly low-ring PAHs with relatively low toxicity. PAH concentrations in fire-impacted sites increased by 684%, 258%, and 155% in the ash, 0-5 cm soil depth interval, and >5 cm soil depth interval, respectively. The increases in PAH concentrations associated with mild-intensity fires (412%) exceeded those associated with moderate-intensity (163%) and high-intensity (168%) fires, which is possibly due to pyromineralization or volatilization of organic matters at high burning temperatures. These increases were highest within a month after the fire (280%), gradually decreasing over time, and showed no significant difference compared to the reference sites after 24 months. The concentration increases exhibit no major difference between various vegetation types (broad-leaved forest vs. coniferous forest vs. shrub). Assessments reveal that exposure to post-fire soil PAHs involves no serious human health risk. However, potential adverse effects of soil PAHs on other organisms (e.g., microbes and plants) and ecosystems should be further examined. The present study highlights the strong impacts of soil depth, fire intensity, and post-fire duration, and the relatively weak impact of the vegetation type on PAH concentrations in soils associated with fires in different areas.","10.1039/d1em00377a","2050-7887 and 2050-7895","","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS","1","32","2050-7887 and 2050-7895",""

However, these mechanized operations require an environmental impact assessment to identify the short-term impacts, both positive and negative. This is especially important in the Mediterranean basin given the specific climatic conditions which exist. In this study, the environmental impact of mechanized shrub harvesting is analyzed in relation to (i) changes in biodiversity and in the presence and growth of species; (ii) physical and chemical properties of the soil; and (iii) changes in forest fire risk. For this purpose, a pre-harvest inventory was conducted and post-harvest monitoring schedules of 1- and 2-year durations were established in three characteristic Mediterranean shrubland formations located in the northern-central area of the Iberian Peninsula. Our results reveal that the recovery rates in biodiversity indices after harvesting were very high, with values ranging from 30 to 70% depending on the site. Two years after harvesting, the species coverage was similar to the pre-harvest scenario in some locations, although not with regards to height, the ericaceous species being those with the greatest sprouting capacity. Significant changes in the physical and chemical properties of soils were also observed. In this regard, negative impacts such as soil compaction or slight acidification were identified at some sites. However, positive effects were also found such as an increment in carbon and nitrogen content after harvesting, along with increased litter quantity a year from the clearing operation due to biomass residue left on the ground after harvesting. Furthermore, mechanical harvesting effectively modified fire behavior in all the shrub formations 2 years after clearing, with a notable reduction in fire risk at all the studied sites.","10.3390/f9070393","1999-4907","","FORESTS","7","","1999-4907",""

It is estimated that the field, as of 2021, it has grown to larger than 13,000 research items, with an excess of 1,200 new articles appearing every year. It also exhibits distinct characteristics of a multidisciplinary research domain. Analyses of the underlying studies reveal that the field is made up of five major divisions. These divisions embody research activities around (i) forest ecology and climate, (ii) fire detection and mapping technologies, (iii) community risk mitigation and planning, (iv) soil and water ecology, and (v) atmospheric science. Research into the sub-topics of reciprocal effects between climate change and fire activities, fire risk modelling/mapping (including burned area modelling), wildfire impact on organic matter, biomass burning, and human health impacts currently constitute trending areas of this field. Amongst these, the climate cluster showed an explosion of activities in 2020 while the human health cluster is identified as the most recent emerging topic of this domain. On the other hand, dimensions of wildfire research related to human behaviour-particularly issues of emergency training, risk perception and wildfire hazard education-seem to be notably underdeveloped in this field, making this one of its most apparent knowledge gaps. A scoping review of all reviews and meta-analysis of this field demonstrates that this sub-topic is also virtually non-existent on the research synthesis front.

Additionally, we explored the potential mechanisms of the relation-ships between multiple response variables to the fire using linear regression and random forest models. On aggregate, fires significantly increased the mean effect sizes of several key soil carbon cycling components-including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total carbon (TC), pyrogenic carbon (PyC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC) by 0.77, 0.89, 0.87, 1.22, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively, compared to unburned forests ecosystems. However, the fire effects on soil C pools vary widely between environmental factors and duration, and are mediated by factors such as tree species, fire type, and soil layer. A correlation analysis displayed the effects of fire on MBC and DOC were significantly and negatively correlated with elevation. Fire effects on the forest floor and mineral soil indicated significantly increased PyC. SOC and TC in coniferous tree species are the most sensitive to fires, thereby altering important feedback relationships with the fire-vegetatale-climate system. Interestingly, latitude has a stronger influence on SOC than mean annual precipitation or elevation, indicating that variations in latitude play a significant role in regulating the amount of SOC in forest ecosystems. Overall, the results illustrated geographic variation in fire effects on soil C cycling underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and help us understand the responses of soil C cycling to fire in forest ecosystems, and facilitate decision-making to forest fire management.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165001","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

Even though many emerging experimental and epidemiological studies have documented the plausible health effects of the predominating toxic pollutants of haze, the consistency among the reported findings by these studies is poorly understood. By addressing such gap, this review aimed to critically highlight the evidence of physical and psychological health impacts of haze from the available literature in ASEAN countries. Systematic literature survey from six electronic databases across the environmental and medical disciplines was performed, and 20 peer-reviewed studies out of 384 retrieved articles were selected. The evidence pertaining to the health impacts of haze based on field survey, laboratory tests, modelling and time-series analysis were extracted for expert judgement. In specific, no generalization can be made on the reported physical symptoms as no specific symptoms recorded in all the reviewed studies except for throat discomfort. Consistent evidence was found for the increase in respiratory morbidity, especially for asthma, whilst the children and the elderly are deemed to be the vulnerable groups of the haze-induced respiratory ailments. A consensual conclusion on the association between the cardiovascular morbidity and haze is unfeasible as the available studies are scanty and geographically limited albeit of some reported increased cases. A number of modelling and simulation studies demonstrated elevating respiratory mortality rates due to seasonal haze exposures over the years. Besides, evidence on cancer risk is inconsistent where industrial and vehicular emissions are also expected to play more notable roles than mere haze exposure. There are insufficient regional studies to examine the association between the mental health and haze. Limited toxicological studies in ASEAN countries often impede a comprehensive understanding of the biological mechanism of haze-induced toxic pollutants on human physiology. Therefore, the lack of consistent evidence among the reported haze-induced health effects as highlighted in this review calls for more intensive longitudinal and toxicological studies with greater statistical power to disseminate more reliable and congruent findings to empower the institutional health planning among the ASEAN countries.","10.1007/s11356-017-0860-y","0944-1344 and 1614-7499","","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","3","2096","0944-1344 and 1614-7499",""

After identifying the nature of the spatial dependence, OLS estimates of the implicit price of wildfire risk are compared to implicit prices obtained using a spatial error model with three different spatial weighting matrices. Spatially corrected estimates of implicit prices are found to be nearly the same as those obtained using OLS. Our results indicate that the inefficiency of OLS in the presence of spatially correlated errors may not always be economically significant, suggesting nonspatial hedonic property models may provide results useful for policy analysis, and spatial and nonspatial hedonic property models might be pooled in meta-analysis.","","1068-5502 and 2327-8285","","JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS","2","212","1068-5502 and 2327-8285",""

Our results revealed a dominant impact of climate fluctuations on forest burned areas, with the driest decades showing fire hazards between 5 to 15 times higher than the average decades. Comparatively, the Euro-Canadian settlement had a much weaker effect, having increased burned areas significantly only during less fire-prone climate conditions. During periods of fire-prone climate, burned areas were maximum independent of fluctuations in Euro-Canadian populations. Moreover, the development of active fire suppression did not appear to reduce burned areas. These results suggest that a potential increase in climate moisture deficit and drought may trigger unprecedented burned areas and extreme fire events no matter the effects of anthropogenic ignition or suppression.","10.1088/1748-9326/ac2ce7","1748-9326","","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","11","","1748-9326",""

The terms used were air pollution OR climate changes OR smoke, AND children OR health. Synthesis of data: The increase in the prevalence of some diseases, such as allergic ones, is attributed to the interactions between genetic potential and the environment. However, disordered growth combined with inadequate waste management has caused problems for the planet, such as heatwaves, droughts, forest fires, increased storms and floods, interference in food crops and their nutritional values, changes in the infectious disease pattern, and air pollution resulting from the continuous use of fossil fuels. Children, beings still in the development stage with immature respiratory and immune systems, are the primary victims of the climate crisis. Conclusions: The authors documented that prenatal and postnatal exposure to ambient air pollutants will accelerate or worsen the morbidity and mortality of many health conditions, including allergic diseases.

These forests are globally recognized for their exceptional biodiversity but are frequently threatened by wildfires. To achieve this, the study uses the space-time scan statistics permutation (STSSP) model to identify areas with a higher frequency of fires. The study also analyzes the effects of fires on the Zagros forests from 2000 to 2021 using remote-sensing MODIS data. Also, to understand the elements at risk of fire, burned areas were assessed based on the richness of vertebrate species, determined by the distribution of 88 vertebrate species. The results show that the annual fire rate in the Zagros forests is 76.2 (fire occurrences per year), calculated using the Poisson distribution. Findings show the highest fire rates are found in the northwest and a part of the south of the Zagros. The northwest of the Zagros also has the largest number of single fires and clusters, indicating a wide spatial distribution of fire in these regions. On the other side, it was unexpectedly found that these regions have the richest number of species and higher habitat value. The results demonstrate a significant correlation between the value of the habitat and the extent of burned areas (p < 0.05). The study also reveals that the greatest impact of fires is on small vertebrates. The overlap of frequent fire spots with the richest regions of Zagros oak forests in terms of vertebrate diversity emphasizes the need for strategic forest risk reduction planning, especially in these priority zones.","10.1038/s41598-024-65355-z","2045-2322","","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","1","","2045-2322",""

The purpose of this systematic review is therefore to assess the current literature about the association between these extreme weather events and their impact on the health of the European population. Methods: Observational studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 17, 2020 on health effects of extreme weather events in Europe were searched systematically in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The exposures of interest included extreme temperature, heat waves, cold waves, droughts, floods, storms and wildfires. The health impacts included total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, respiratory mortality and morbidity, and mental health. We conducted the systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the NICE quality appraisal checklist (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Results: The search yielded 1472 articles, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Studies regarding five extreme weather events (extreme heat events, extreme cold events, wildfires, floods, droughts) were found. A positive association between extreme heat/cold events and overall, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was reported from most studies. Wildfires are likely to increase the overall and cardiovascular mortality. Floods might be associated with the deterioration of mental health instead of mortality. Depending on their length, droughts could have an influence on both respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Contradictory evidence was found in heat-associated morbidity and wildfire-associated respiratory mortality. The associations are inconclusive due to the heterogeneous study designs, study quality, exposure and outcome assessment. Conclusions: Evidence from most of the included studies showed that extreme heat and cold events, droughts, wildfires and floods in Europe have negative impacts on human health including mental health, although some of the associations are not conclusive. Additional high-quality studies are needed to confirm our results and further studies regarding the effects of other extreme weather events in Europe are to be expected.","10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113688","1438-4639 and 1618-131X","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH","","","1438-4639 and 1618-131X",""

Studies were mostly conducted in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Positive associations of wildfire-specific PM with respiratory morbidity were observed in most studies. Studies that focused on respiratory mortality were limited. Females can be more vulnerable to the respiratory impacts of wildfire PM, while the evidence of vulnerable subpopulations among different age groups was inconclusive. Few studies compared the effects of wildfire -specific vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM, and some reported higher levels of toxicity of wildfire-specific PM, potentially due to its distinct chemical and physical compositions. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most studied diseases, and both were adversely affected by wildfire-specific PM.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first review that systematically summarized the associations of wildfire -specific PM exposure with adverse respiratory outcomes and compared associations of wildfire-specific vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM.

A Systematic Review","2023","6","11","","search 1, search 2, search 3, search 4, search 5","search, search, search, search, search","Fire suppression has become a fundamental approach for shaping contemporary wildfire regimes. However, a growing body of research suggests that aggressive fire suppression can increase high-intensity wildfires, creating the wildfire paradox. Whether the strategy always triggers the paradox remains a topic of ongoing debate. The role of fire suppression in altering wildfire regimes in diverse socio-ecological systems and associated research designs demands a deeper understanding. To reconcile these controversies and synthesize the existing knowledge, a systematic review has been conducted to screen 974 studies on the relationship between fire suppression and wildfire regimes. The rigorous screening process led to the selection of 37 studies that met our stringent criteria for inclusion. The selected literature was quantitatively analyzed in terms of study areas, study design and methods, and the impact of fire suppression on wildfire regimes. Several critical findings were revealed: 1. Numerous studies have focused on northern mid- and high-latitude biomes, neglecting tropical savannas where wildfires are frequent and intense. Further exploration in these regions is imperative. 2. Existing studies have predominantly employed methods such as difference analysis, regression analysis, and scenario simulations. Appropriate methods could be selected based on the study area, data availability, and understanding of fire regimes. 3. Despite the consensus that fire suppression reduces the total burned area, the emergence of the wildfire paradox remains controversial, with approximately equal amounts of the literature supporting and contradicting the wildfire paradox. A noteworthy pattern was observed: the wildfire paradox is more likely to occur in fuel-limited systems, specific vegetation types, and smaller scale and longer term studies. This systematic review highlights that the occurrence of the wildfire paradox is intricately tied to ecosystem feedback mechanisms for suppression and the research scale adopted. It is necessary to incorporate a comprehensive and multi-scale assessment of how local wildlands respond to suppression into wildfire management policy-making processes. This assessment will ensure a more informed and effective wildfire management strategy adapted to local conditions.","10.3390/fire6110424","2571-6255","","FIRE-SWITZERLAND","11","","2571-6255",""

Scientific understanding of the composition, chemistry and regional dynamics of biomass burning (BB) emissions is still limited, thus constraining the implementation of appropriate research and policy interventions. The broad categories, associated complex emissions and spatio-temporal variations of ABB in India are discussed here. Major types of ABB that are prevalent year-round all over India include BB for cooking, heating purposes and open waste burning. Moreover, crop residue burning (CRB) in the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) during pre- (April-May) and post-monsoon (October-November) seasons, CRB in South India during January-February, forest fires in Central India and slash-and-burn agriculture in Northeast India during March-May are the other dominant sources that are active during specific months and in specific regions. Over the IGP, CRB along with other episodic ABB events and stagnant meteorology result in severe air quality and poor visibility (<similar to 300 m) with reported daily mean PM2.5 concentrations shooting up to 15 times higher than Central Pollution Control Board standards. When compared with wheat residue burning, higher fire counts and emissions are reported during paddy residue burning events. During winters, BB's contribution to 37% of the aerosol oxidative potential in Delhi indicates its health implications. Meta-analysis of data obtained from representative source apportionment studies on PM10 shows >24% BB contribution in Assam, Ahmedabad, Kanpur and Visakhapatnam, 20%-24% in Patiala and Kolkata, and 10%-14% in Delhi.

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially recent mixed-severity fires with representative patches of high-severity burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from post-fire logging. Meta-analysis of mean standardized effects (I ledge's d) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a significant positive foraging habitat selection for low-severity burned forest. Multi-level mixed effects meta-regressions (hierarchical models) of I ledge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction was positively correlated with the percent of high-severity fire in owl territories; and positive selection for foraging in low- and moderate-severity burned forest, with high-severity burned forest used in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta-analysis of variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in estimates of occupancy demography, and survival, and lower variation in estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low-severity burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by mixed-severity fire, as 83% of all studies and 60% of all effects found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl, mixed-severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for Spotted Owls.","10.1002/ecs2.2354","2150-8925","","ECOSPHERE","7","","2150-8925",""

To reduce this threat and improve overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the remaining area. A necessary step in designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that small-diameter removal and burning treatments would have minimal effects on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies that met our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for wildlife species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments, (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact design using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis occurred <20 years post-treatment on sites <400 ha. Small-diameter harvest and burning treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. We examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and wildfire. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife species in the studies we examined in the short-term (: 10 years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement across the landscape will result in the highest diversity and density. We recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative response variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of data.

Methods: We searched CINAHL Complete, Ovid/EMBASE, Ovid/MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant epidemiological observational studies indexed through September 2023. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed by pairs of independent reviewers.Results: Our systematic search yielded 28,549 records. After duplicate removal, we screened 14,009 studies, identifying 31 for inclusion in the present review. Data extraction highlighted high methodological heterogeneity between studies, including a lack of geographic variation. Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1). Pooled meta-analysis for birthweight and low birthweight were inconclusive, likely due to low number of methodologically homogenous studies. However, the reviewed studies provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of birthweight reduction, low birthweight, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes.Conclusions: This review identified 31 studies evaluating the impacts of maternal wildfire smoke exposure on maternal, infant, and child health. Although we found suggestive evidence of harm from exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy, more methodologically homogenous studies are required to enable future meta -analysis with greater statistical power to more accurately evaluate the association between maternal wildfire smoke and adverse birth outcomes and other health outcomes.","10.1016/j.envres.2023.117527","0013-9351 and 1096-0953","","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH","","","0013-9351 and 1096-0953",""

Predators also exert strong effects on ecological communities, through top-down regulation of prey and competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their ubiquity, ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor, hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators world-wide. We found 160 studies spanning 1978-2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes (Hedges' g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas, or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations, taxonomic families and study designs, but most were located in North America and Oceania (59% and 24%, respectively), and largely focussed on felids (24%) and canids (25%). Half (50%) of the studies reported responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life-history traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red foxes Vulpes vulpes mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers Coluber constrictor negatively, with variances overlapping zero only slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context-specific management of predator-fire relationships is required.","10.1111/1365-2656.13153","0021-8790 and 1365-2656","","JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","4","955","0021-8790 and 1365-2656",""

Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), with co-occurring species, are adapted to a disturbance regime of frequent surface fires, but extended fire exclusion and other factors have led to historically uncharacteristically dense stands and high fuel loadings, supporting high-severity fires. Treatments to begin to reverse these changes and reduce fuel hazards have been tested experimentally and observations of wildfire behavior in treated stands have also been reported. Using a systematic review methodology, we found 54 studies with quantitative data suitable for meta-analysis. Combined treatments (thinning + burning) tended to have the greatest effect on reducing surface fuels and stand density, and raising modeled crowning and torching indices, as compared to burning or thinning alone. However, changes in canopy base height and canopy bulk density were not consistently related to treatment intensity, as measured by basal area reduction. There are a number of qualifications to the findings. First, because it is not feasible to subject treated areas to severe fire experimentally, inferences about potential fire behavior rely on imperfect modeling techniques. Second, research has not been carried uniformly over the ranges of the pine forests, although we found no significant differences in treatment effects between regions or forest types. Overall, however, meta-analysis of the literature to date strongly indicates that thinning and/or burning treatments do have effects consistent with the restoration of low-severity fire behavior.

Still, it can also act as a negative force against many ecosystems. Despite some knowledge of the interactions of fire and vegetation, there is no clear understanding of how different components of fire regimes (i.e., severity, history, or frequency) influence known patterns of animal communities. Therefore, we performed a systematic review on the global responses of arthropods, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians to different fire regimes. Specifically, we focused on assessing how fire severity, history, and frequency modulate the effect of fire on the richness and abundance of faunal communities. We conducted a systematic review of 566 papers retrieved from the Scopus database. We also scrutinized all the documents included in the meta-analysis of Pastro et al. (Pastro et al. Glob Ecol Biogeogr 23:1146-1156, 2014). Our selection criteria excluded studies without data on species richness or abundance. We also excluded studies without adequate controls and those without information about the fire regime of the study zone. After careful examination, we used data from 162 studies to perform a quantitative meta-analysis. From the 162 studies meeting our selection criteria, nearly 60% of the studies are from North America, 25% from Australia, 11% from Europe, and 4% from the tropics. According to the ecological role of fire, 90% of the studies were carried out in fire-dependent ecosystems (i.e., conifer forests, natural savannas, pastures). Finally, 40% of the studies analyzed birds, 22% mammals, and 20% arthropods. The meta-analysis of the available evidence indicates that fire history is an important modulator of animal richness and abundance. Whether negative or positive, animal responses depended on the time since the last fire event. Considering that short-term studies may not capture such a long-term effect on fauna, this translates to more challenges at implementing fire management strategies. Whether or not we can anticipate the impact of the fire will then depend on future efforts to implement long-term research.","10.1186/s13717-021-00357-7","2192-1709","","ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES","1","","2192-1709",""

These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed. Results: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential newdirections, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of datamining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology. Conclusions: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests thatmanymore fruitful applications can be expected in the future.","10.1186/s12889-017-4914-3","1471-2458","","BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","","","1471-2458",""

Increased floral display size can attract more pollinators and increase absolute fruit and seed production immediately after a fire. However, anthropogenic increases in fire frequency may alter these responses. We aim to assess the effects of fire on the pollination and reproductive success of plants at the global scale.Methods We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to examine overall fire effects as well as different fire parameters on pollination and on plant reproduction. We also explored to what extent the responses vary among pollinators, pollination vectors, plant regeneration strategies, compatibility systems, vegetation types and biomes.Key Results Most studies were conducted in fire-prone ecosystems. Overall, single fires increased pollination and plant reproduction but this effect was overridden by recurrent fires. Floral visitation rates of pollinators were enhanced immediately following a wildfire, and especially in bee-pollinated plants. Fire increased the absolute production of fruits or seeds but not fruit or seed set. The reproductive benefits were mostly observed in wind-pollinated (graminoids), herbaceous and resprouter species. Finally, fire effects on pollination were positively correlated with fire effects on plant reproductive success.Conclusions Fire has a central role in pollination and plant sexual reproduction in fire-prone ecosystems. The increase in the absolute production of fruits and seeds suggests that fire benefits to plant reproduction are probably driven by increased abiotic resources and the consequent floral display size. However, reproduction efficiency, as measured by fruit or seed set, does not increase with fire. In contrast, when assessed on the same plant simultaneously, fire effects on pollination are translated into reproduction. Increased fire frequency due to anthropogenic changes can alter the nature of the response to fire.","10.1093/aob/mcae033","0305-7364 and 1095-8290","","ANNALS OF BOTANY","","","0305-7364 and 1095-8290",""

Currently, knowledge of the extent and characteristics of animal mortality rates during fire remains rudimentary, hindering our ability to predict how animal populations may be impacted in the future. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a global systematic review of the direct effects of fire on animal mortality rates, based on studies that unequivocally determined the fate of animals during fire. From 31 studies spanning 1984-2020, we extracted data on the direct impacts of fire on the mortality of 31 species from 23 families. From these studies, there were 43 instances where direct effects were measured by reporting animal survival from pre- to post-fire. Most studies were conducted in North America (52%) and Oceania (42%), focused largely on mammals (53%) and reptiles (30%), and reported mostly on animal survival in planned (82%) and/or low severity (70%) fires.

Although there were insufficient data to conduct a formal meta-analysis, we tested the effect of fire type, fire severity, fire regime, animal body mass, ecological attributes and class on survival. Only fire severity affected animal mortality, with a higher proportion of animals being killed by high than low severity fires. Recent catastrophic fires across the globe have drawn attention to the plight of animals exposed to wildfire. Yet, our systematic review suggests that a relatively low proportion of animals (mean predicted mortality [95% CI] = 3% [1%-9%]) are killed during fire. However, our review also underscores how little we currently know about the direct effects of fire on animal mortality, and highlights the critical need to understand the effects of high severity fire on animal populations.","10.1111/gcb.16044","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","6","2053","1354-1013 and 1365-2486",""

Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales ( < 25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts ( > 75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term ( < 25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire. Ecological restoration in forests across the western US has to carefully balance the budget of ecosystem carbon with competing objectives such as improved wildlife habitat, reduced risk of severe wildfire, and other ecosystem services.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.07.029","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","625","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

Recently, published literature examining wildlife response to fire and fire management has increased rapidly.

Using meta-analysis, we examined the scientific literature on vertebrate demographic responses to burn severity (low/moderate, high), fire surrogates (forest thinning), and fire and fire surrogate combined treatments in the most extensively studied fire-prone, forested biome (forests of the United States). Effect sizes (magnitude of response) and their 95% confidence limits (response consistency) were estimated for each species-by-treatment combination with two or more observations. We found 41 studies of 119 bird and 17 small-mammal species that examined short-term responses (<= 4 years) to thinning, low/moderate-and high-severity fire, and thinning plus prescribed fire; data on other taxa and at longer time scales were too sparse to permit quantitative assessment. At the stand scale (<50 ha), thinning and low/moderate-severity fire demonstrated similar response patterns in these forests. Combined thinning plus prescribed fire produced a higher percentage of positive responses. High-severity fire provoked stronger responses, with a majority of species possessing higher or lower effect sizes relative to fires of lower severity. In the short term and at fine spatial scales, fire surrogate forest-thinning treatments appear to effectively mimic low/moderate-severity fire, whereas low/moderate-severity fire is not a substitute for high-severity fire. The varied response of taxa to each of the four conditions considered makes it clear that the full range of fire-based disturbances (or their surrogates) is necessary to maintain a full complement of vertebrate species, including fire-sensitive taxa. This is especially true for high-severity fire, where positive responses from many avian taxa suggest that this disturbance (either as wildfire or prescribed fire) should be included in management plans where it is consistent with historic fire regimes and where maintenance of regional vertebrate biodiversity is a goal.","","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","5","1547","1051-0761 and 1939-5582",""

Location Terrestrial ecosystems, excluding Antarctica. Time period Data collected from 1973 to 2017. Major taxa studied Insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) and a few bird species. Methods We first compiled available studies across the globe that assessed fire effects on pollinator communities. Then, by means of hierarchical meta-analyses, we evaluated how different fire regime parameters (fire frequency, postfire time and fire type) and habitat characteristics affect the abundance and richness of animals that act as pollinators. We also explored to what extent the responses vary among taxa groups and life history traits of pollinators (sociality system, nest location and feeding specialization), and among biomes. Results The overall effect size of fire on pollinator abundance and richness across all studies was positive. Fire effect was especially clear and significant in early postfire communities, after wildfires, and for Hymenoptera. Taxonomic resolution influenced fire effects, where only studies at the species/genus and family levels showed significant effects. The main exceptions were recurrent fires that showed a negative effect, and especially wildfire effects on Lepidoptera abundance that showed a significant negative response. Main conclusions Pollinators tend to be promoted after a wildfire event. However, short fire intervals may threat pollinators, and especially lepidopterans. Given the current fire regime changes at the global scale, it is imperative to monitor postfire pollinators across many ecosystems, as our results suggest that fire regime is critical in determining the dynamics of pollinator communities.","10.1111/geb.12939","1466-822X and 1466-8238","","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","10","1487","1466-822X and 1466-8238",""

There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones. 2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones. 3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition. 4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial. 5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.","10.1111/fwb.12888","0046-5070 and 1365-2427","","FRESHWATER BIOLOGY","3","445","0046-5070 and 1365-2427",""

This trend is predicted to continue, causing significant adverse health effects to nearby residential populations and placing a potential strain on local emergency departments (EDs). Study Objective: The aim of this literature review was to identify papers relating to wildfires and their impact on EDs, specifically patient presentation characteristics, resource utilization, and patient outcomes. Method: This integrative literature review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for data collection, and Whittemore and Knafl's framework for data analysis. Data were collected from OvidSP, MEDLINE, DARE, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus databases. Various Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords identified papers relevant to wildfires/bushfires and EDs. Results: Literature regarding the relationship between ED presentations and wildfire events, however, is primarily limited to studies from the United States and Australia and indicates particulate matter (PM) is principally linked to adverse respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes. Observable trends in the literature principally included a significant increase in respiratory presentations, primarily with a lag of one to two days from the initial event. Respiratory and cardiovascular studies that stratified results by age indicated individuals under five, over 65, or those with pre-existing conditions formed the majority of ED presentations. Conclusion: Key learnings from this review included the need for effective and targeted community advisory programs/procedures, prior to and during wildfire events, as well as pre-event planning, development, and robust resilience strategies for EDs.","10.1017/S1049023X22001054","1049-023X and 1945-1938","","PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE","5","657","1049-023X and 1945-1938",""

Generally, the scant aspen populations that remain in the Southwest lack resilience and adaptive capacity, and managers are unsure how best to maintain the species in an uncertain future. This systematic review seeks to address that need by reviewing existing literature from the Southwest on which biotic and abiotic factors influence aspen forest dynamics and by synthesizing that literature with a discussion of how management can promote aspen ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity. We found that fire and silvicultural treatments promote aspen regeneration, but chronic ungulate browse inhibits recruitment. Moreover, drought is a driver of overstory mortality and has a negative influence on recruitment. In the second half of this review, we propose three management objectives for increasing aspen resilience and adaptive capacity: (1) promote diversity in age structure, (2) mitigate ungulate impacts, and (3) enhance complexity. We consider how various management strategies could meet these objectives and highlight potential threats to aspen forest health and resilience.","10.1093/forsci/fxad004","0015-749X and 1938-3738","","FOREST SCIENCE","3","334","0015-749X and 1938-3738",""

To counteract unnaturally high fuel loads, fuel reduction treatments which are designed to reduce fire hazard and improve overall ecosystem functioning have been increasing over the last decade. However, until recently much of what we knew about treatment effectiveness was based on modeling and predictive studies. Now, there are many examples of wildfires burning through both treated and untreated areas, and the effectiveness of treatments versus no action can be evaluated empirically. We carried out a systematic review to address the question: Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social (saving human lives and property) objectives? We found 56 studies addressing fuel treatment effectiveness in 8 states in the western US. There was general agreement that thin + burn treatments had positive effects in terms of reducing fire severity, tree mortality, and crown scorch. In contrast, burning or thinning alone had either less of an effect or none at all, compared to untreated sites. Most studies focused on carbon storage agreed that treatments do not necessarily store more carbon after wildfire, but result in less post-wildfire emissions and less carbon loss in a wildfire due to tree mortality. Understory responses are mixed across all treatments, and the response of other ecological attributes (e.g., soil, wildlife, water, insects) to treatment post-wildfire represents an important data gap; we provide a detailed agenda for future research. Overall, evidence is strong that thin + burn treatments meet the goal of reducing fire severity, and more research is needed to augment the few studies that indicate treatments protect human lives and property.

Objective To review the current evidence on the association between climate change-related environmental stressors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Evidence Review PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications from January 1, 1970, through November 15, 2023, that evaluated associations between environmental exposures and cardiovascular mortality, acute cardiovascular events, and related health care utilization. Studies that examined only nonwildfire-sourced particulate air pollution were excluded. Two investigators independently screened 20 798 articles and selected 2564 for full-text review. Study quality was assessed using the Navigation Guide framework. Findings were qualitatively synthesized as substantial differences in study design precluded quantitative meta-analysis. Findings Of 492 observational studies that met inclusion criteria, 182 examined extreme temperature, 210 ground-level ozone, 45 wildfire smoke, and 63 extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, dust storms, and droughts. These studies presented findings from 30 high-income countries, 17 middle-income countries, and 1 low-income country. The strength of evidence was rated as sufficient for extreme temperature; ground-level ozone; tropical storms, hurricanes, and cyclones; and dust storms. Evidence was limited for wildfire smoke and inadequate for drought and mudslides. Exposure to extreme temperature was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but the magnitude varied with temperature and duration of exposure. Ground-level ozone amplified the risk associated with higher temperatures and vice versa. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, were associated with increased cardiovascular risk that persisted for many months after the initial event. Some studies noted a small increase in cardiovascular mortality, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease after exposure to wildfire smoke, while others found no association. Older adults, racial and ethnic minoritized populations, and lower-wealth communities were disproportionately affected. Conclusions and Relevance Several environmental stressors that are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but data on outcomes in low-income countries are lacking.

Under the direction of an informationist, the databases PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science (Science and Social Science Citation Index) were searched from inception to July 2019. Results: Of 5,229 citations identified, 17 articles met the study criteria. Included articles were retrospective observational in nature and focused on earthquakes (24%, n = 4), hurricane (41%, n = 7), and wildfire (35%, n = 6) disasters. Outcome data by disease process included COPD (35%, n = 6), ESRD (41%, n = 7), CHF (24%, n = 4), and diabetes (29%, n = 5).

Discussion and Implications: Disaster research faces unique methodological challenges, and there remains a need for data-driven conclusions on how best to care for older adults before, during, and after disasters. To encourage consistent dialogue among studies, we advocate for the use of rigorous and standardized scientific methodology to examine the health impacts of disasters on adults with chronic disease.","10.1093/geront/gnz123","0016-9013 and 1758-5341","","GERONTOLOGIST","7","E535","0016-9013 and 1758-5341",""

However, the coarse fraction (PM10-2.5) may have independent health impacts that support continued measurement of PM10 in some areas, such as those affected by road dust. The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between different measures of daily PM exposure and two daily indicators of population health in seven communities in British Columbia, Canada, where road dust is an ongoing concern. The measures of exposure were PM10, PM2.5, PM10-2.5, PM2.5 adjusted for PM10-2.5, and PM10-2.5 adjusted for PM2.5. The indicators of population health were dispensations of the respiratory reliever medication salbutamol sulfate and nonaccidental mortality. This study followed a time-series design using Poisson regression over a 2003-2015 study period, with analyses stratified by three seasons: residential woodsmoke in winter; road dust in spring; and wildfire smoke in summer. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to establish a pooled estimate. Overall, an interquartile range increase in daily PM10-2.5 was associated with a 3.6% [1.6, 5.6] increase in nonaccidental mortality during the road dust season, which was reduced to 3.1% [0.8, 5.4] after adjustment for PM2.5. The adjusted coarse fraction had no effect on salbutamol dispensations in any season. However, an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 2.7% [2.0, 3.4] increase in dispensations during the wildfire season. These analyses suggest different impacts of different PM fractions by season, with a robust association between the coarse fraction and nonaccidental mortality in communities and periods affected by road dust. We recommend that PM10 monitoring networks be maintained in these communities to provide feedback for future dust mitigation programs.

Many studies have been published on this matter but there is no consensus in the literature on the magnitude and duration of these effects since the relevant hydrological conditions are site-specific. Moreover, the relationship between post-fire hydrology and its main environmental drivers has been little explored. This study has carried out a bibliographic review and a meta-analysis of the changes resulting from prescribed fire applications (water infiltration, soil water repellency (SWR), surface runoff and soil erosion) using a database of 85 case studies from 41 academic papers that have been published over the last 23 years. The effects of annual precipitation, soil slope, burn severity, fire application season, post-fire ground cover, and vegetation type on those changes have also been statistically explored. The bibliographic review has revealed that previous case studies have not been equally distributed across the globe but concentrated in only a few countries, mainly the United States and Spain. The meta-analysis has revealed that (i) water infiltration generally decreases and SWR appears with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion immediately after the prescribed fire, while the pre-fire values progressively recover over time; (ii) the window of disturbance in burned soils may last a few months (with some exceptions); (iii) annual precipitation and soil slope significantly influence water infiltration and surface runoff, but not soil erosion, in both the short-term and medium-term; (iv) moderate-to-high levels of soil burn severity severely enhance surface runoff and soil erosion, and noticeably reduce water infiltration in the short-term; (v) the level of ground cover burning is important for reducing the runoff rates, but it plays a minor role in water infiltration and soil erosion rates;and (vi) the prescribed fire applied in spring results in lower increases in short-term runoff and erosion, while fire applications in summer and in shrublands produce the highest increases in soil loss. The following practical recommendations arise from this study: (i) research should be better distributed across all environmental contexts on a global scale; (ii) post-fire management actions should be immediately implemented after the prescribed fire application; (iii) prescribed fire should be carried out in spring and the soil burn severity should be kept low during burning; (iv) the monitoring studies should be prolonged at least for some years (more than two or three) after prescribed fire; (iv) the catchment-scale investigations, although more difficult and expensive, should be encouraged (avoiding, however, areas to sparsely burnt in the context of the whole catchment); (v) the monitored variables should also include the most important physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, the cover and structure of regenerating vegetation, as well as the water quality parameters; (vi) the effects of repeated applications of prescribed fire should be experimentally assessed; and (vii) guidelines for standardized and appropriate measurements and analytical methods in experimental activities should be set up. These indications support the use of land managers in the monitoring of the hydrological impacts of the prescribed fire and in the choice of sites where post-fire management actions must be implemented. The last recommendation of this study is the creation of an experimental database supporting the bibliographic review and the meta-analysis, which is made available to other researchers and land managers, to create a public, easily-accessible and comprehensive tool for future research needs and professional use.","10.1002/hyp.14957","0885-6087 and 1099-1085","","HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES","9","","0885-6087 and 1099-1085",""

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify the determinants of health hazards among populations impacted by CCRHHs. Identified determinants were then grouped into categories of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity and aligned with available data. Data were aggregated to 4188 Census dissemination areas within two health authorities in British Columbia, Canada. A two-step principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to select and weight variables for each relative vulnerability score. In addition to an overall vulnerability score, exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity sub-scores were computed for each hazard. Scores were then categorised into quintiles and mapped. Results: Two hundred eighty-one epidemiological papers met the study criteria and were used to identify 36 determinant indicators that were operationalized across all hazards. For each hazard, 3 to 5 principal components explaining 72 to 94% of the total variance were retained. Sensitivity was weighted much higher for extreme heat, wildfire smoke and ground-level ozone, and adaptive capacity was highly weighted for flooding vulnerability. There was overall varied contribution of adaptive capacity (16-49%) across all hazards. Distinct spatial patterns were observed - for example, although patterns varied by hazard, vulnerability was generally higher in more deprived and more outlying neighbourhoods of the study region. Conclusions: The creation of hazard and category-specific vulnerability indices (exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity sub-scores) supports evidence-based approaches to prioritize public health responses to climate-related hazards and to reduce inequity by assessing relative differences in vulnerability along with absolute impacts. Future studies can build upon this methodology to further understand the spatial variation in vulnerability and to identify and prioritise actionable areas for adaptation.","10.1186/s12940-021-00708-z","1476-069X","","ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH","1","","1476-069X",""

We modeled effect sizes of measures of population abundance or occupancy as a function of various combinations of these traits and variables with phylogenetic least squares regression. Nine of 115 modeled species (7.83%) returned statistically significant effect sizes, suggesting most mammals are resilient to fire. The top-ranked model predicted a negative impact of fire on species with lower reproductive rates, regardless of fire type (estimate = -0.68), a positive impact of burrowing in prescribed fires (estimate = 1.46) but not wildfires, and a positive impact of average fire return interval for wildfires (estimate = 0.93) but not prescribed fires. If a species' International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List assessment includes fire as a known or possible threat, the species was predicted to respond negatively to wildfire relative to prescribed fire (estimate = -2.84). These findings provide evidence of experts' abilities to predict whether fire is a threat to a mammal species and the ability of managers to meet the needs of fire-threatened species through prescribed fire. Where empirical data are lacking, our methods provide a basis for predicting mammal responses to fire and thus can guide conservation actions or interventions in species or communities.","10.1111/cobi.14062","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","4","","0888-8892 and 1523-1739",""

Compliance differs according to socio-demographic characteristics. 3) At -risk groups may be advised to stay indoors before the general population, in order to protect the most vulnerable people in a community. The research included in this review was observational and predominantly descriptive, and is therefore unable to sufficiently answer questions regarding effectiveness.

We conducted a meta-analysis of population data for 4 populations in the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1990 to 2005 to assist a listing evaluation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study areas (from N to S) were on the Lassen National Forest (LAS), Eldorado National Forest (ELD), Sierra National Forest (SIE), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (SKC). These study areas represented a broad spectrum of habitat and management conditions in these mountain ranges. We estimated apparent survival probability, reproductive output, and rate of population change for spotted owls on individual study areas and for all study areas combined (meta-analysis) using model selection or model-averaging based on maximum-likelihood estimation. We followed a formal protocol to conduct this analysis that was similar to other spotted owl meta-analyses. Consistency of field and analytical methods among our studies reduced confounding methodological effects when evaluating results. We used 991 marked spotted owls in the analysis of apparent survival. Apparent survival probability was higher for adult than for subadult owls. There was little difference in apparent survival between male and female owls. Model-averaged mean estimates of apparent survival probability of adult owls varied from 0.811 +/- 0.021 for females at LAS to 0.890 +/- 0.016 for males at SKC. Apparent survival increased over time for owls of all age classes at LAS and SIE, for adults at ELD, and for second-year subadults and adults at SKC. The meta-analysis of apparent survival, which included only adult owls, confirmed an increasing trend in survival over time. Survival rates were higher for owls on SKC than on the other study areas. We analyzed data from 1,865 observations of reproductive outcomes for female spotted owls. The proportion of subadult females among all territorial females of known age ranged from 0.00 to 0.25 among study areas and years. The proportion of subadults among female spotted owls was negatively related to reproductive output (no. of young fledged/territorial F owl) for ELD and SIE. Eldorado study area and LAS showed an alternate-year trend in reproductive output, with higher output in even-numbered years. Mean annual reproductive output was 0.988 +/- 0.154 for ELD, 0.624 +/- 0.140 for LAS, 0.478 +/- 0.106 for SIE, and 0.555 +/- 0.110 for SKC. Eldorado Study Area exhibited a declining trend and the greatest variation in reproductive output over time, whereas SIE and SKC, which had the lowest reproductive output, had the lowest temporal variation. Meta-analysis confirmed that reproductive output varied among study areas. Reproductive output was highest for adults, followed by second-year subadults, and then by first-year subadults. We used 842 marked subadult and adult owls to estimate population rate of change. Modeling indicated that lambda(t) (lambda(t) is the finite rate of population change estimated using the reparameterized Jolly-Seber estimator [Pradel 1996]) was either stationary (LAS and SIE) or increasing after an initial decrease (ELD and SKC). Mean estimated lt for the 4 study areas was 1.007 (95% CI 5 0.952-1.066) for ELD; 0.973 (95% CI 5 0.946-1.001) for LAS; 0.992 (95% CI 5 0.966-1.018) for SIE; and 1.006 (95% CI 5 0.947-1.068) for SKC. The best meta-analysis model of population trend indicated that l varied across time but was similar in trend among the study areas. Our estimates of realized population change (Delta Franklin et al. 2004), which we estimated as the product 1 x (lambda) over cap (3) x (lambda) over cap (1) x ... x (lambda) over cap (k-1), were based on estimates of lambda(t) from individual study areas and did not require estimating annual population size for each study area. Trends represented the proportion of the population size in the first year that remained in each subsequent year. Similar to (lambda) over cap (t) on which they were based, these (Delta) over cap (t) showed evidence of decline over the study period for LAS and SIE. The best model indicated recruitment of male and female adult and subadults varied from 0.10 to 0.31 new territorial individuals at time t/number of territorial individuals at time t - 1 and similarly among areas. We also conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) based on results of our meta-analysis. This PVA was of limited utility for ELD and SKC study areas because 95% confidence intervals on the probability of decline or increase spanned the interval [0, 1] within 5-10 years. When we restricted inferences to 7 years, estimated probability of a >10% decline for SIE was 0.41 (95% CI 5 0.09-0.78); for LAS the probability was 0.64 (95% CI 5 0.27-0.94). In contrast, estimated probability of a >10% increase in 7 years for SIE was 0.23 (95% CI 5 0.01-0.55) and for LAS was 0.10 (95% CI 5 0.00-0.34). For comparisons, we simulated a PVA for a hypothetical population with mean lambda = 1.0 and the same temporal variation as observed in our owl populations. Our PVA suggested that both the SIE and LAS populations had higher probabilities of declining in a 7-year period than increasing but that it would be difficult to determine if a population was in a slight gradual decline. Our analysis and the repository of information on our 4 study populations provide a data-rich template for managers to monitor impacts of future management actions on the owl. Specifically, our data can be used to evaluate the effect of management strategies on spotted owls that are being implemented by the United States Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildfire in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem. Our information also provides baseline information for evaluating the status of the owl for potential listing as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.","","0084-0173 and 1938-5455","","WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS","174","1","0084-0173 and 1938-5455",""

A growing body of epidemiology literature reports increased rates of emergency departments, hospital admissions and premature deaths from wildfire smoke exposure. Objective: Our research aimed to characterize excess mortality and morbidity events, and the economic value of these impacts, from wildland fire smoke exposure in the U.S. over a multi-year period; to date no other burden assessment has done this. Methods: We first completed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature and then performed photochemical air quality modeling for the years 2008 to 2012 in the continental U.S. Finally, we estimated the morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of wildland fires. Results: Our models suggest that areas including northern California, Oregon and Idaho in the West, and Florida, Louisiana and Georgia in the East were most affected by wildland fire events in the form of additional premature deaths and respiratory hospital admissions. We estimated the economic value of these cases due to short term exposures as being between $11 and $20B (2010$) per year, with a net present value of $63B (95% confidence intervals $6-$ 170); we estimate the value of long-term exposures as being between $76 and $130B (2010$) per year, with a net present value of $450B (95% confidence intervals $42-$ 1200).

Eight databases were searched in May 2022 and again in June 2023. Empirical studies discussing climate change and workforce policy, planning, preparedness, and capacity were included. Inductive thematic analysis of extracted data was conducted.ResultsFrom the 60 included studies, two categories emerged: the impacts of climate events on the health workforce (n = 39), and workforce responses to and preparations for climate events (n = 58). Thirty-seven studies reported on both categories. Four impact themes were identified: absenteeism, psychological impacts, system breakdown, and unsafe working conditions; and six responses and preparations themes: training/skill development, workforce capacity planning, interdisciplinary collaboration, role flexibility, role incentivisation, and psychological support.ConclusionThis review provides an overview of some of the deleterious impacts of climate events on the health workforce, as well as potential strategies for the health workforce to prepare or respond to climate events. Future studies should assess the implementation and effectiveness of these strategies to ensure a continuously improving healthcare system, and a well-supported health workforce. The health workforce will be integral in our response to climate events. Climate events cause absenteeism, psychological harm, and unsafe working conditions. Health systems need a workforce that is flexible, collaborative, and adaptive.

Yet, knowledge of global pattern of forest disturbance agents, its drivers, and shifts under changing climate remain scarce. Here we present a meta-analysis of current and projected (+2 degrees and + 4 degrees C) distribution of forest disturbance agents causing immediate tree mortality (i.e., fire, pest outbreak, hydro-geomorphic, and wind) at country, continental, biome, and global scales. The model including combination of climatic (precipitation of driest quarter, actual evapotranspiration, and minimum temperature), geographical (distance to coast and topography complexity), and forest characteristics (tree density) performs better than any other model in explaining the distribution of disturbance agents (R-2 = 0.74). We provide global maps (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees) of current and potential future distribution of forest disturbance agents. Globally, the most frequent disturbance agent was fire (46.09 %), followed by pest outbreak (23.27 %), hydro-geomorphic disturbances (18.97 %), and wind (11.67 %). Our projections indicate spatially contrasting shifts in disturbance agents, with fire and wind risk increase between similar to 50 degrees S and similar to 40 degrees N under warming climate. In particular, the substantial increase in fire risk, exceeding 31 % in the most affected areas, is projected over Mediterranean, the western and southeast USA, African, Oceanian, and South American forests. On the other hand, pest outbreak and hydro-geomorphic disturbances are projected to increase in more southern (> similar to 50 degrees S) and northern (> similar to 40 degrees N) latitudes. Our findings are critical for understanding ongoing changes and developing mitigation strategies to maintain the ecological integrity and ecosystem services under shifts in forest disturbances. We suggest that projected shifts in the global distribution of forest disturbance agents needs to be considered to future models of vegetation or carbon sink dynamics under projected climate change.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170117","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

Although end-of-life and palliative care are considered essential components of disaster planning and response, there are gaps in understandings about their real-life application, and how natural disasters impact end-of-life care. Objective To synthesise existing evidence of the impacts of natural disasters (eg, bushfires, communicable pandemics, etc) on end-of-life care. Methods A systematic review with a narrative synthesis was undertaken. The review was registered on PROSPERO (registration: CRD42020176319). PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for studies published in English between 2003 and 2020, with findings explicitly mentioning end-of-life care impacts in relation to a natural disaster. Articles were appraised for quality using a JBI-QARI tool. Results Thirty-six empirical studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment. Findings were synthesised into three key themes: impacts on service provision, impacts on service providers and impacts on service users. This review demonstrates that natural disasters impact profoundly on end-of-life care, representing a stark departure from a palliative care approach. Conclusions Clinical practitioners, policy makers and researchers must continue to collaborate for viable solutions to achieve universal access to compassionate and respectful end-of-life care, during natural disasters. Using models, policies and practices already developed in palliative care, involving those most impacted in disaster planning and anticipating barriers, such as resource shortages, enables development of end-of-life care policies and practices that can be rapidly implemented during natural disasters.","10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-002973","2045-435X and 2045-4368","","BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE","1","1","2045-435X and 2045-4368",""

A systematic literature review facilitated the reconstruction and evaluation of giant tortoise habitat, feeding habitats, diets and Aldabrachelys tortoise impacts on disturbance regimes. In conclusion, reintroduction of mixed-feeding Aldabrachelys (the diets of which were often dominated by C-3 woody material, but never by C-4 grasses, across its range), will likely impact plant species composition, select a tree-rich habitat mosaic, reduce fire frequency, re-establish lost ecological functions and improve landscape productivity at a range of scales, including rangeland palatability, benefitting both biodiversity and human wellbeing.SummaryGrasslands with little tree cover today comprise 80% of Madagascar's habitat. Determining their extent at human settlement can guide ecological restoration and enhance human well-being, so the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop identified the role of extinct megafauna in determining habitat as a critical knowledge gap. Using a systematic literature review, combined with extracted datasets, we address this, examining anticipated habitat selection by giant tortoises following reintroduction to Madagascar (where the Aldabran giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, provides ecological functions lost when A. abrupta and A. grandidieri went extinct). When comparing current and historical tortoise selection of habitat across the Mascarenes and Aldabra with contemporary Malagasy habitat, areas in Madagascar where giant tortoises historically ranged, today have a significantly different habitat composition to the forested habitat that supported giant tortoises on other islands. Dietary C-13 isotope ratios show that Malagasy Aldabrachelys and Mascarene tortoises were mixed feeders, with diets often dominated by C-3 woody intake, but never by C-4 grasses. Across systems, giant tortoises required and selected, tree-rich habitat mosaics, different to current pastoralist fire-selected Malagasy grasslands characterized by sparse tree cover. Furthermore, Aldabran Aldabrachelys tortoise turf, restricted to small areas (large tracts of unshaded vegetation present physiological challenges to Aldabrachelys' survival), is compositionally different to Malagasy and African obligate C-4 grazing lawns. Ecological, palaeoecological, geomorphological and molecular evidence support a lost Malagasy habitat mosaic where hippo and tortoise diets were C-3-dominated, because they inhabited closed-canopy systems, with abutting open-canopy areas harbouring endemic-rich, C-4 grassy understories and limited grasslands. The review suggests that rewilding with A. gigantea will help restore ecological functions, productivity and landscape-scale degradation lost through cattle-based pastoralism, re-establish tree-rich habitat mosaics, and mitigate against frequent bushfires, benefiting biodiversity and humans at multiple scales.","10.1002/ppp3.10474","2572-2611","","PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET","3","570","2572-2611",""

War metaphors exhibited little advantage over literal frames across a variety of desirable outcomes (i.e. the adoption of pro-health behaviors against COVID-19, perceived solidarity and collective responsibility to curb the pandemic, and intentions to discuss and share the health news with others). However, this study revealed some benefits of war metaphors over fire metaphors. Compared with fire metaphors, health news featuring war metaphors increased both positive emotions and perceived threats of COVID-19, which in turn promoted pro-health behaviors against COVID-19 and perceived solidarity to cope with the public health crisis. Moreover, positive emotions in response to war metaphors also indirectly encouraged the retransmission of science-based COVID-19 health news. This study thus showcased the benefits and limitations of war metaphors and revealed the mediating roles of perceived threats and positive emotions in explaining war metaphorical framing effects. Implications of using war and fire metaphors for communicating about public health crises are also discussed.","10.1080/10410236.2023.2253398","1041-0236 and 1532-7027","","HEALTH COMMUNICATION","","","1041-0236 and 1532-7027",""

Results showed that fire significantly decreased soil C (-15.2%) and N (-14.6%) but increased soil PyC (40.6%) and PyC/TOC (30.3%). Stronger negative fire impacts on soil C and N were found in tropical and temperate climates than in Mediterranean and subtropical climates; stronger effects were found in forest ecosystems than in non-forest ecosystems. Wildfire and high-severity fire led to greater soil C and N losses than prescribed and low-severity fires, respectively, while they promoted greater increases in soil PyC and PyC/TOC than prescribed and low-severity fires, respectively. However, soil C and N recovered to control levels approximately 10 years after fire, which is a shorter period than previously determined. These results suggest that fire-induced PyC production should be accounted for in the C budget under global change. These results will improve our knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of fire effects on soil C and N storage and have implications for fire management and ecosystem recovery.","10.1111/gcb.15742","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","17","4196","1354-1013 and 1365-2486",""

The chemical transport model GEOS-Chem driven with Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED), in combination with ground monitored data and machine learning was used to estimate wildfire-related PM2.5 data at a resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. A time-series design was applied in each immediate region to assess the association between economic losses due to mortality and wildfire-related PM2.5 and the estimates were pooled at the national level using a random-effect meta-analysis. We used a metaregression model to explore the modification effect of GDP and its sectors (agriculture, industry, and service) on economic losses.Results: During 2000-2016, a total of US$81.08 billion economic losses (US$5.07 billion per year) due to mortality were attributable to wildfire-related PM2.5 in Brazil, accounting for 0.68% of economic losses and equivalent to approximately 0.14% of Brazil's GDP. The attributable fraction (AF) of economic losses due to wildfire-related PM2.5 was positively associated with the proportion of GDP from agriculture, while negatively associated with the proportion of GDP from service.Conclusion: Substantial economic losses due to mortality were associated with wildfires, which could be influenced by the agriculture and services share of GDP per capita.

There is a lack of consensus on whether (and to what extent) post-fire management assists or hinders managers in achieving goals, particularly in under-studied regions like eastern ponderosa pine forests. This makes it difficult for forest managers to balance among competing interests. We contrast structural and community characteristics across unburned ponderosa pine forest, severely burned ponderosa pine forest, and severely burned ponderosa pine forest treated with post-fire management with respect to three management objectives: ponderosa pine regeneration, wildland fuels control, and habitat conservation. Ponderosa pine saplings were more abundant in treated burned sites than untreated burned sites, suggesting increases in tree regeneration following tree planting; however, natural regeneration was evident in both unburned and untreated burned sites. Wildland fuels management greatly reduced snags and coarse woody debris in treated burned sites. Understory cover measurements revealed bare ground and fine woody debris were more strongly associated with untreated burned sites, and greater levels of forbs and grass were more strongly associated with treated burned sites. Wildlife habitat was greatly reduced following post-fire treatments. There were no tree cavities in treated burned sites, whereas untreated burned sites had an average of 27 +/- 7.68 cavities per hectare. Correspondingly, we found almost double the avian species richness in untreated burned sites compared to treated burned sites (22 species versus 12 species). Unburned forests and untreated burned areas had the same species richness, but hosted unique avian communities.

Exclusion of fire by livestock grazing and intentional suppression is thought to have been a cause of these changes. National assessments suggest that many woodlands have missed one or more low-severity surface fires and are thus in poor condition, requiring restoration. We undertook a systematic review of seven questions about fire history, fire severity, and the role of fire in these woodlands to evaluate the scientific basis for the national assessment. First, unless pi (n) over tilde ons and jumpers record fire by means of fire scars, it will be difficult to reconstruct fire history. Evidence suggests that most species of pi (n) over tilde ons and jumpers can record fire by means of scars, but scars may be uncommon or absent in some cases and common in others. This variability in scarring has competing explanations that are poorly substantiated. Second, evidence exists for at least three modes of low-severity surface fires in these woodlands: (1) spreading surface fires, (2) patchy surface fires of small extent, and (3) an absence or near absence of surface fires. Methodological problems limit our ability to assess how common each mode is, but spreading, low-severity surface fires were likely not common. Third, there are no reliable estimates of mean fire intervals for low-severity surface tires in these woodlands because of methodological problems. Fourth, fires can kill small trees in true savannas and grasslands,. helping to maintain a low tree density, but in most pi (n) over tilde on-jumper woodlands low-severity surface fires do not consistently lower tree density and may become high-severity fires. Fifth, nearly all observed fires since EuroAmerican settlement in these woodlands were high-severity fires. In only two studies is there sufficient information to allow a conclusion about whether high-severity fires have or have not increased since settlement, and in these cases the authors conclude they have not. Sixth, the fire rotation for high-severity fires is estimated in only two studies, 400 years in one case, 480 years in the other. Finally, fires may in some cases burn with mixed severity. In conclusion, national fire plans and assessments of the condition and health of pi (n) over tilde on-jumper woodlands in the western United States are based on premature and likely incorrect conclusions about the natural fire regime in pi (n) over tilde on-jumper woodlands. Local research is essential, at the present time, if effective, scientifically based restoration prescriptions are to be derived. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The way a young person copes with the event plays a significant role in development of post-disaster psychopathology. Coping has been widely studied after acute onset disasters, however, difficulties conducting research in post-disaster contexts and the individualized nature of coping make accurate assessment of coping a significant challenge. A systematic literature search of multiple databases and previous reviews was conducted, exploring scholarly documentation of coping measurement and the relationship between coping and post-traumatic stress (PTSS) symptoms after acute onset disasters. A total of 384 peer-reviewed manuscripts were identified, and 18 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. The studies examined coping and post-traumatic stress in the wake of acute onset disasters such as terrorist events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires. Greater PTSS symptoms were related to internalizing, externalizing, rumination, and avoidant coping strategies. Coping measurement was constrained due to measurement variance, lack of developmentally and contextually vali-dated instruments, theoretical misalignment, and absence of comprehensive tools to assess coping. Robust and consistent measures of coping should be established to inform research and interventions to reduce the impact of disasters on children's and adolescents' well-being.","10.3390/ijerph18094865","1660-4601","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH","9","","1660-4601",""

Prescribed fires could be a useful tool to control or eliminate invasive species; however, they are not yet fully accepted as a management tool in natural ecosystems. We conducted a systematic review to gather information on the use of fire as a tool to control invasive woody species in natural areas around the world. Our work reveals not only the scarcity of reports focusing on the effects of fire on woody plants, but also its uneven distribution across continents and subcontinents. Most studies cover areas less than 10 ha and analyze the effect of a single burn. The frequency and intensity of fires is indicated only in a few cases, despite being a key characteristic for the survival of the plants targeted for control. Almost 80 % of the studies aimed that sought to evaluate the effect of prescribed burning as a control tool for invasive woody species reported positive results in that direction, and most of them explicitly recommended prescribed burning as an effective intervention. We conclude that prescribed fires have high potential for use in invasion management, particularly in fire-adapted ecosystems, and point out some features that, if considered in the works that study the effects of fire, would allow to strengthen the evidence about its value and limitations as a management tool.","10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110602","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","","","0006-3207 and 1873-2917",""

Factors contributing to vulnerability included personal factors (e.g., female gender, uncoupled or living alone, nonwhite ethnicity, and low income), environmental factors (commonly, limited practical support from government agencies and disability organizations), bodily impairments (cognitive impairments, hearing impairments, progression of impairments, relapse/exacerbation of symptoms, and thermoregulation difficulties), and activity limitations and participation restrictions (limited preparedness, difficulties with evacuation, and difficulties reassembling individual accommodations and repairing or replacing adaptive equipment). Factors relating to their adaptive capacity included personal factors (e.g., formal education), environmental factors (practical support from mainstream organizations, disability organizations, family, and friends), and activities and participation (emergency planning, keeping an emergency pack, and seeking information).

Yet, how microorganisms respond to postfire phosphorus (P) enrichment to alter soil N transformations remains unclear in N-limited boreal forests. Here, we investigated postfire N-P interactions using an intensive regional-scale sampling of 17 boreal forests in the Greater Khingan Mountains (Inner Mongolia-China), a laboratory P-addition incubation, and a continental-scale meta-analysis. We found that postfire soils had an increased risk of N loss by accelerated N-min and nitrification along with low plant N demand, especially during the early vegetation recovery period. The postfire N/P imbalance created by P enrichment acts as a ""N retention"" strategy by inhibiting N-min but not nitrification in boreal forests. This strategy is attributed to enhanced microbial N-use efficiency and N immobilization. Importantly, our meta-analysis found that there was a greater risk of N loss in boreal forest soils after fires than in other climatic zones, which was consistent with our results from the 17 soils in the Greater Khingan Mountains. These findings demonstrate that postfire N-P interactions play an essential role in mitigating N limitation and maintaining nutrient balance in boreal forests.","10.1021/acs.est.4c01662","0013-936X and 1520-5851","","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","24","10611","0013-936X and 1520-5851",""

Thirty-seven publications yielded 305 effect sizes for tree density and 135 for height. We found no significant effect of salvage logging on tree density or height. Also, most effect moderators were not significant. The effect size of salvage logging on tree density increased over time after logging, potentially indicating resilience to initial salvage logging impacts. Tree density in old (>100 years) disturbed forests was less negatively affected by salvage logging than in young (<50 years) and intermediate-aged forests. Study site and phylogenetic relatedness improved model fit, indicating modulation by local ecological factors and tree species characteristics. Synthesis. Salvage logging does not produce generalised detrimental effects on tree regeneration. Potential impacts and their mitigation should be assessed upon knowledge of local conditions and species.","10.1111/1365-2745.13581","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","9","3224","0022-0477 and 1365-2745",""

This study used a meta-analysis method to synthesize up to 185 data sets from 87 studies published from 1955 to 1999. Six N response variables related to fire were examined: fuel N amount (FNA) and concentration (FNC). soil N amount (SNA) and concentration (SNC). and soil ammonium (NH4-) and nitrate (NO3-) pools. When all comparisons (fire treatment vs. control) were considered together, fire significantly reduced FNA (58%), increased soil NH4+ (94%) and NO3- (152%), and had no significant influences on FNC, SNA, and SNC. The responses of N to fire varied with different independent variables, which were vegetation type, fire type, fuel type, fuel consumption amount, fuel consumption percentage, time after fire, and soil sampling depth. The response of FNA to fire was significantly influenced by vegetation type. fuel type, and fuel consumption amount and percentage. The reduction in FNA was linearly correlated with fuel consumption percentage (r(2) = 0.978). The response of FNC to fire was only affected by fuel type. None of the seven independent variables had any effect on SNA. The responses of SNC, NH4+, and NO3- depend on soil sampling depth. The responses of both NH4+ and NO3- to fire were significantly affected by fire type and time after fire but had different temporal patterns. The soil NH4+ pool increased approximately twofold immediately after fire, then gradually declined to the prefire level after one year. The fire-induced increase in the soil NO3- pool was small (24%) immediately after fire, reached a maximum of approximately threefold of the prefire level within 0.5-1 year after fire, and then declined. This study has identified the general patterns of the responses of ecosystem N that occur for several years after fire. A key research need relevant to fire management is to understand how the short-term responses of N to fire influence the function and structure of terrestrial ecosystems in the long term.","10.2307/3060925","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","5","1349","1051-0761 and 1939-5582",""

The middle level intervention, designed for delivery by allied health and primary care practitioners for survivors with ongoing mild-moderate distress, involved a protocol still in draft form called Skills for Psychological Recovery (SPR). SPR was developed by the US National Center for PTSD and US National Child Traumatic Stress Network. This study examined health practitioner perceptions of the training in, and usefulness of, SPR. Methods: From a range of disciplines 342 health practitioners attended one of 25 one-day workshops on the delivery of SPR. Perceptions of evidence-based care and attitudes to manualized interventions were assessed at the commencement of the workshop. Following the workshop, participants' perceptions of their confidence in applying, and perceived usefulness of, each module were assessed. A subset of 20 participants recorded their ongoing use of SPR recording 61 cases. Results: The vast majority of participants rated the SPR modules as useful for survivors of disasters and expressed confidence in implementing the intervention following the training. Participants 'pre-workshop attitudes towards evidence-based care and manualized interventions affected their perceptions of the usefulness of the protocol. The 'Promoting positive activities' and 'Rebuilding healthy social connections' modules were least influenced by variations in these perceptions. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that SPR is perceived by health providers from varying disciplines and paradigms as an acceptable and useful intervention for disaster survivors with moderate levels of mental health difficulties. Future SPR dissemination efforts may benefit from focusing on modules with the strongest evidence base and which are most amenable to practitioner acceptance and uptake.","10.3109/00048674.2010.513674","0004-8674 and 1440-1614","","AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY","12","1105","0004-8674 and 1440-1614",""

In October 2017, Northern California experienced devastating and historic wildfires leaving the community in need of support to foster emotional resilience during the recovery process. Adolescents represent a particularly vulnerable population in the wake of disaster, and digital mental health interventions may hold promise for reaching teens at scale. The present study examined the feasibility and efficacy of a mobile mental health app for disaster, Sonoma Rises. A multiple-baseline single-case experimental design (SCED) utilizing a research-enabled version of the app was employed with seven adolescents who experienced significant damage to their homes and schools in the wildfires. Participants completed daily mood ratings, weekly measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and then pre-post-measures of anxiety, depression, wellbeing, sleep, academic engagement, and perceived social support as well as quantitative and qualitative measures of intervention satisfaction and feasibility. Sonoma Rises was found to be feasible in terms of engagement, satisfaction, and likelihood of recommending to a friend. During the study, another wildfire occurred and all participants underwent a prolonged mandated evacuation and were subject to a series of extended power outages. Uptake of the publicly available version of the Sonoma Rises app among the general population was modest but engagement among users was sustained. Lessons learned are offered to contribute to the science and practice of building, disseminating, and implementing digital tools to conduct more equitable disaster mental health outreach and research.","10.1037/ser0000576","1541-1559 and 1939-148X","","PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES","","67","1541-1559 and 1939-148X",""

In this meta-analysis, we examined the resilience of surface soil properties and their spatial patterning to disturbance by fire in sagebrush steppe of North America - a biome currently experiencing increases in wildfire due to climate change. We reviewed 39 studies that reported on soil properties for sagebrush steppe with distinct microsite (undershrub and interspace) patterning that was or was not recently burned. We estimated microsite effects for 21 soil properties and examined the effect of burning on microsite effects during the first year post-fire, before the re-establishment of vegetation. Results indicated that the spatial patterning of biogeochemical resources, in which soil surfaces beneath shrubs are enriched, is resilient to burning. However, microsite effects for soil-surface hydrologic, temperature and erosion characteristics appeared to shift following burning. These shifts appear to create a negative feedback for the spatial patterning of soil properties before vegetation recovery. Relatively long (decades-centuries) historic fire intervals in sagebrush steppe ecosystems likely reinforce spatial patterning of soil resources. However, increased fire frequency might affect the ability for soil resources to withstand change.","10.1071/WF11092","1049-8001 and 1448-5516","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE","5","545","1049-8001 and 1448-5516",""

The factors that determine drip water calcium ion concentrations are the soil and vadose zone CO2 concentrations, and the hydrogeochemical evolution of the water from soil to cave. Here, we use a systematic literature review of cave drip water calcium concentrations, combined with PHREEQC equilibrium modelling, to investigate the global relationship between calcium concentration and surface climate. Our results are discussed in the context of understanding the climatic and environmental controls on drip water calcium concentration, speleothem growth rates and proxies of past climate and environmental change. We use an empirical, global soil CO2 concentration-temperature relationship to derive PHREEQC modelled cave drip water calcium concentrations. The global mean modelled drip water calcium concentration is close to that observed, but it over-predicts at high and low temperatures, and significantly under-predicts at temperate conditions. We hypothesise that closed system hydrochemical evolution due to water saturation is an important control on carbonate dissolution at colder temperatures. Under warmer conditions, for example temperate climates with a dry and hot or warm summer, seasonally-limited water availability can lead to: <100% soil cover; water-limitations on microbial and root respiration; wildfire; and prior calcite precipitation, all of which limit drip water calcium concentrations. In temperate climates with no dry season, higher CO2 concentrations than modelled from soil values are necessary to explain the observed drip water calcium values, which we, propose is from an additional source of CO2 from microbial activity and root respiration in the vadose zone during open system hydrochemical evolution.

The quantification of future climate risks is based on climate model predictions. Here, we present a review of literature focusing on extreme climate projections in the latest generation of climate models, namely, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) from 2020 to the present. We highlight the extreme events that could cause potential societal risks, including precipitation (the 90th percentile of the cumulative frequency distribution of daily precipitation), temperature (the 10th or 90th percentile of daily temperature within a reference period), droughts (meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural), floods, heat waves, and compound/concurrent extremes. Regionally, the precipitation extremes are projected to increase in North Africa (Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya), followed by drying in South Africa. Heatwaves will increase in a warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) in Asia (Indo-Gangetic Plain) and Afghanistan. The rise in heat stress intensity in Asia will augment the climate risks to agriculture under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. On a global scale, land areas are projected to face severe drought specifically in higher biomass regions, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Future droughts bring hazards to Europe and the Amazon River basin with severe aridification over Australia, the Middle East, South and North Africa, and Central Asia.

Logging to ""salvage"" economic returns from forests affected by natural disturbances has become increasingly prevalent globally. Despite potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for post-disturbance management are widely lacking. 2. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been conducted less than 5years following natural disturbances, and focused on non-saproxylic organisms. 3. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms) decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats increased in the number of species after salvage logging. 4. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of 17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas. Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.","10.1111/1365-2664.12945","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","1","279","0021-8901 and 1365-2664",""

In the last half-century, shifts in the culture and policy of land management agencies have facilitated the management practice of letting some naturally ignited fires burn, allowing fire to fulfill its ecological role and increasing the extent of fire-related research opportunities. With the goal of identifying the global scientific advances enabled by this paradigm shift in wilderness fire management, we conducted a systematic review of publications that either (1) selected protected areas for investigation because of an active fire regime enabled by wilderness fire management, (2) studied modern fires or fire regimes deliberately located in a wilderness area, or (3) conducted applied research to support wilderness fire management.ResultsOur systematic review returned a sample of 222 publications that met these criteria, with an increase in wilderness fire science over time. Studies largely occurred in the USA and were concentrated in a relatively small number of protected areas, particularly in the Northern Rocky Mountains. As a result, this sample of wilderness fire science is highly skewed toward areas of temperate mixed-conifer forests and historical mixed-severity fire regimes. Common principal subjects of publications included fire effects (44%), wilderness fire management (18%), or fire regimes (17%), and studies tended to focus on vegetation, disturbance, or wilderness management as response variables.ConclusionsThis work identifies major scientific contributions facilitated by fire in wilderness, including self-limitation of fire, the effects of active fire regimes on forest and aquatic systems, barriers and potential solutions to wilderness fire management, and the effect of fire on wilderness recreation and visitor experiences. Our work reveals geographic and bioclimatic areas where more research attention is needed and highlights under-represented wilderness areas that could serve to fill these gaps. Finally, we identify priorities for future wilderness fire research, including the past and potential role of Indigenous and prescribed burning, the effects of changing climate and fire regimes on ecosystem processes, and how to overcome barriers to wilderness fire management.","10.1186/s42408-023-00195-2","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","1","","1933-9747",""

However, global warming, land-use changes and other anthropogenic factors have strongly altered natural fire regimes worldwide. Despite the growing number of studies evaluating the effects of fire on biodiversity, little is understood about how burn affects certain groups that are particularly sensitive to climatic extremes, such as anurans. Here, we conducted a global and systematic literature review of studies assessing anurofauna responses to fire disturbances. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and theoretical information criteria to assess how fire affects anuran assemblages. We analyzed 68 studies, widely distributed in the globe, which examined the fire effects on abundance, richness and/or species behavior. In total, 191 species were considered, being Gastrophryne carolinensis and Lithobates catesbeianus the most evaluated. We reveal a lack of general anurofauna response to fire, as species and assemblages were either negatively or positively affected by burns. We observed that the fire treatments (Prescribed fire, Wildfire and without fire) and the biome where the study was conducted did not explain the variation in species abundance. Most studies were conducted in biomes classified as Temperate Forests, followed by Tropical Savannas and Tropical Forests. We highlight that future studies should consider factors associated to fire (e.g. fire treatment, fire properties), research design and species biology to explain patterns of species persistence and community structure. Although fire plays a key role in shaping several natural ecosystems, we have recently witnessed drastic changes in natural burning regimes all over the world, which imply leading to severe population reductions and even species extinctions. Given this scenario, government authorities should urgently support and invest in scientific studies that evaluate, monitor and test fire management practices in natural ecosystems and therefore establish mitigation actions to preserve the biota constantly threatened by the imbalance of this environmental disturbance.","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119338","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

Although wildfire is an integral part of certain ecosystems, fires in many places are becoming larger and more intense, driven largely by climate change, land abandonment, and changes in fuel management with important socioeconomic, environmental, and ecosystem services consequences for Europe. In order to envision a comprehensive fire risk mitigation strategy for Europe, a spatial assessment of opportunities to manage fuels at the landscape-scale is needed. Our study explored the suitability of three land management strategies (LMS)-herbivory, mechanical fuel removal, and prescribed burn-which can create more heterogenous fuelscapes, thereby reducing an element of fire risk. We created suitability maps for each of the LMS using adoption factors identified in a systematic literature review (n = 123). We compared these maps with areas of historical fire occurrence as a proxy for fire risk to prioritize key areas for intervention. We found that over a quarter of Europe was suitable for multiple LMS within areas of greater fire risk, creating opportunities for concurrent and synergistic use of the strategies. Options were more limited in areas of southern Europe, where prescribed burn was found to be uniquely viable amongst the LMS evaluated. Opportunities were also restricted in some areas of high fire risk in northern Europe, where herbivory was found to be the only suitable LMS. Our findings take a wide-view of fuel management to target landscapescale decision making focused on reducing fire risk. However, many other factors must be taken into account to successfully manage fuels at local scales, including the socio-cultural appropriateness of the LMS, the viability of incentive schemes, and possible trade-offs with other management goals, such as carbon storage and biodiversity.","10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118941","0301-4797 and 1095-8630","","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","","","0301-4797 and 1095-8630",""

Of particular concern to forest and wildfire managers is the influence of MPB outbreaks on wildfire via spatial legacies left in impacted forest stands. There is, however, limited consensus in the literature regarding how MPB outbreaks affect wildfire across western North America. Objectives This meta-analysis aims to (1) summarize available evidence regarding MPB-wildfire interactions, and (2) identify environmental and methodological indicators associated with various wildfire responses (i.e., amplified, neutral, or dampened) post-outbreak. Methods We include peer-reviewed publications focusing on MPB outbreaks and subsequent wildfire activity in forests across western Canada and the USA between 2000 and 2021. A classification scheme was used to examine attributes of each publication to assess which indicators contribute most to their associated wildfire response. Results We found that spatial scale, forest fuels, and weather are main drivers of variation in wildfire response post-outbreak. Metrics of forest fuels and inclusion of weather data on a stand-scale are related to amplified fire responses, whereas dampened responses correspond to landscape-scale analyses. Furthermore, red-stage stands are associated with amplified fire response, whereas other stages are associated with dampened response-supporting current conceptual models of the importance of outbreak stage on wildfire. Conclusions Advancing our understanding regarding drivers of wildfire responses post-MPB outbreak is key to developing accurate, and comparative research studies. These findings provide crucial information for wildfire, and forest management agencies, especially in forests newly exposed to this disturbance interaction under climate change.","10.1007/s10980-023-01720-z","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","9","2159","0921-2973 and 1572-9761",""

In the current study, the literature on the effects of fire on soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C, and total N, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil was reviewed, and the results of a meta-analysis on literature data were reported. Overall, fire significantly increased the soil total N, microbial biomass N. dissolved organic C, and total N, but decreased soil organic C, microbial biomass C, respiration and N mineralization. Among the significant effects of different fire types, wildfire had the higher effects on the soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved total N and respiration of soil than prescribed fire. In addition, responses of soil organic C. total N and N mineralization to wildfire depended on forest type and natural zone. Positive responses of soil organic C, total N were found in broadleaved forests and Mediterranean zones, and negative responses in coniferous forests and temperate zones. Wildfire significantly decreased N mineralization in coniferous forests. The effects of fire on soil microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N mineralization generally decreased with time after the fire. In general, the effects of fire on soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and dissolved total N and N mineralization decreased with increasing soil depth.

In addition, the response of soil C cycling and storage varied among different soil and ecosystem types, with a stronger response being observed in forest than in grassland. Within 20 years post-fire, soil C cycling and storage tended to recover only after one fire but not after frequent fire.

Salvage and sanitation loggings (hereafter salvage logging) are usually practiced following such disturbance events and the generated deadwood is then extracted from the forest. Those practices affect a broad array of species, including fungi, lichens, invertebrates, and vertebrates that make use of deadwood either as habitat, food resource, foraging substrate, or as shelter. Woodpeckers, being a key group of forest birds dependent on deadwood, can be affected by salvage logging in two ways: (1) a reduction in the availability of food (i.e. removal of deadwood along with the saproxylic and predatory invertebrates that usually colonize dead or dying trees following forest disturbances) and (2) a decrease in potential nest sites due to the removal of dead trees. Therefore, we assessed the global effects of salvage logging on woodpecker abundance and reproduction by conducting a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data. We focused on comparing woodpeckers' responses to forest disturbance in salvage-logged and unlogged sites. We considered different types of responses found in the literature, including abundance, occurrence, nest density, and breeding success. When analyzing the responses of woodpeckers, we also accounted for the potential effects of tree density, time since logging, elevation, latitude, and the continent. Recent Findings We found that both numbers and reproduction of woodpeckers were affected by salvage logging following a disturbance event. Apart from salvage logging, woodpecker responses were not significantly related to any other variables. This highlights that salvage logging can pose a substantial threat to woodpecker assemblages as well as secondary cavity-users dependent on them. Salvage logging and related practices that affect deadwood availability should be carefully planned and preferably avoided entirely in areas important for woodpecker conservation. In managed forests, deadwood should be retained in sufficient quantities to avoid detrimental impacts on woodpeckers and on forest biodiversity in general.","10.1007/s40725-022-00175-w","2198-6436","","CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS","1","1","2198-6436",""

Therefore, we leveraged a historical study (conducted 1959-70) with remeasurements in 2015 to evaluate effects of fire season (dormant, summer), frequency (annual, biennial, periodic), and their interaction on soil physical and chemical properties in a red pine (Pinus maltose Ait.) forest in northern Minnesota, USA. To protect against across-year differences in sampling and analysis, we used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate treatment effects on soil properties. We also used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination to investigate legacy (> 45 years post-fire) treatment effects. The greatest effects of fire occurred in organic horizons, and decreased with depth. In the short-term, fire decreased organic horizon depths and nitrogen (N) and increased base cations (K, Ca, Mg) and pH in the mineral soil, whereas effects on phosphorus (P) were variable. Prescribed fire treatments had legacy effects on organic horizon and mineral soil properties > 45 years post-fire. In general, summer burns decreased nutrient stocks, whereas dormant season burns increased nutrient stocks, and the majority of legacy effects occurred in annual burn treatments, in both seasons. Legacy effects of summer burns decreased organic horizon depths, organic matter, nutrient stocks (N, P, K), and pH, as well as lower (0-15 cm) mineral soil N; whereas, the dormant annual burn increased Ca in the total forest floor and N and P in the upper (15-91 cm) mineral soil. In contrast, the summer annual burn increased P, whereas the dormant annual burn decreased pH in the lower mineral soil. Trends in short- and long-term effect sizes appeared to differ by season of burning and further magnified by increased fire frequency within season. Relative to dormant season burns, summer burns resulted in immediate and long-lasting desirable effects for red pine ecosystems (e.g., decreased forest floor depths and nutrient stocks) without persistent undesirable effects (e.g., increased nutrient stocks or changes in cation exchange capacity, soil texture, and bulk density) in the mineral soil. Our results suggest that summer burns may be a valuable approach to increase the variability in burn schedules representative of historical regional fire regimes in red pine forests, and may help promote soil characteristics that support overall ecosystem health.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.01.021","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","47","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

A century of aggressive logging and fire suppression in combination with conditions exacerbated by climate change have created an ongoing ecological, economic, and public health emergency. Between commercial harvests on California's working forestlands and the increasing number of acres the state treats each year for fire risk reduction and carbon sequestration, California forests generate millions of tons of woody residues annually-residues that are typically left or burned in the field. State policymakers have turned to biomass electricity generation as a key market for woody biomass in the hope that it can support sustainable forest management activities while also providing low-carbon renewable electricity. However, open questions surrounding the climate and air pollution performance of electricity generation from woody biomass have made it difficult to determine how best to manage the risks and opportunities posed by forest residues. The California Biomass Residue Emissions Characterization (C-BREC) model offers a spatially-explicit life cycle assessment framework to rigorously and transparently establish the climate and air pollution impacts of biopower from forest residues in California under current conditions. The C-BREC model characterizes the variable emissions from different biomass supply chains as well as the counterfactual emissions from prescribed burn, wildfire, and decay avoided by residue mobilization. We find that the life cycle 'carbon footprint' of biopower from woody residues generated by recent forest treatments in California ranges widely-from comparable with solar photovoltaic on the low end to comparable with natural gas on the high end. This variation stems largely from the heterogeneity in the fire and decay conditions these residues would encounter if left in the field, with utilization of residue that would otherwise have been burned in place offering the best climate and air quality performance. California's energy and forest management policies should account for this variation to ensure desired climate benefits are achieved.","10.1088/1748-9326/acbd93","1748-9326","","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","3","","1748-9326",""

Ten diet studies recorded 175 total species that burros consumed. However, these studies and two exclosure studies suggested that burros preferentially eat graminoid and forb groups over shrubs. One study in Death Valley National Park, for example, found that Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian ricegrass) was 11 times more abundant in burro diets than expected based on its availability. Utilization studies revealed that burros also exhibit preferences within the shrub group. Eighty-three percent of reviewed documents were produced in a 12-year period, from 1972 to 1983, with the most recent document produced in 1988. Because burros remain abundant on many federal lands and grazing may interact with other management concerns (e.g., desert wildfires fueled by exotic grasses), rejuvenating grazing research to better understand both past and present burro effects could help guide revegetation and grazing management scenarios.","10.1007/s00267-008-9105-7","0364-152X","","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","6","809","0364-152X",""

To date, priority responses have been biased towards high-profile taxa with substantial information bases. Here, we demonstrate that sufficient data are available to model the extinction risk for many less well-known species, which could inform much broader and more effective ecological disaster responses.

We suggest that two species are now eligible for listing as Endangered and nine are eligible for listing as Vulnerable under IUCN criteria, on the basis of fire overlap, intensity, frequency, and life-history traits: this tally far exceeds the three Australian bee species listed as threatened prior to the wildfire. We demonstrate how to undertake a wide-scale assessment of wildfire impact on a poorly understood group to help to focus surveys and recovery efforts.

Previous risk assessments have examined the health response to total PM2.5, not just PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, and have used a concentration-response function with limited support from the literature and data at both high and low concentrations. This assessment examines mortality associated with PM2.5 from only fossil fuel combustion, making use of a recent meta-analysis of newer studies with a wider range of exposure. We also estimated mortality due to lower respiratory infections (LRI) among children under the age of five in the Americas and Europe, regions for which we have reliable data on the relative risk of this health outcome from PM2.5 exposure. We used the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to estimate global exposure levels to fossil-fuel related PM2.5 in 2012. Relative risks of mortality were modeled using functions that link long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality, incorporating nonlinearity in the concentration response. We estimate a global total of 10.2 (95% CI: -47.1 to 17.0) million premature deaths annually attributable to the fossil-fuel component of PM2.5. The greatest mortality impact is estimated over regions with substantial fossil fuel related PM2.5, notably China (3.9 million), India (2.5 million) and parts of eastern US, Europe and Southeast Asia. The estimate for China predates substantial decline in fossil fuel emissions and decreases to 2.4 million premature deaths due to 43.7% reduction in fossil fuel PM2.5 from 2012 to 2018 bringing the global total to 8.7 (95% CI: -1.8 to 14.0) million premature deaths. We also estimated excess annual deaths due to LRI in children (0-4 years old) of 876 in North America, 747 in South America, and 605 in Europe. This study demonstrates that the fossil fuel component of PM2.5 contributes a large mortality burden. The steeper concentration-response function slope at lower concentrations leads to larger estimates than previously found in Europe and North America, and the slower drop-off in slope at higher concentrations results in larger estimates in Asia. Fossil fuel combustion can be more readily controlled than other sources and precursors of PM2.5 such as dust or wildfire smoke, so this is a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders to further incentivize a shift to clean sources of energy.","10.1016/j.envres.2021.110754","0013-9351 and 1096-0953","","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH","","","0013-9351 and 1096-0953",""

It has focused on conservation of ecosystem function through reducing soil erosion and spread of invasive plants. Effectiveness of mitigation treatments has been debated recently. We reviewed recent literature to conduct a meta-analysis of seeding after wildfires to determine if seedings may (1) protect ecosystems against soil erosion and (2) reduce invasion or abundance of undesirable nonnative plant species. Effectiveness of postfire seedings was examined in 8 erosion and 19 invasive species cases. Seeding has little effect on erosion during the first year after fire and is highly dependent upon initial establishment and coverage of species in successive years. Among all seeding cases, 28% reduced, 67% were neutral, and 5% increased invasive species abundance. Older seedings were more likely to show reductions in invasives than younger seedings. Seedings with high plant establishment were more likely to reduce invasives than those with low establishment. Studies are needed that examine (1) frequency of adequate establishment of postfire seedings and causal factors of success or failure, (2) long-term impacts of seeding along a range of initial establishment and concomitant plant coverage over time as it relates to erosion and abundance of invasive plant species, and (3) auxiliary treatments designed to increase likelihood of germination and establishment given the inevitable variability of environmental conditions.

The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests, and whether burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Methods: The review examined primary field studies of the effects of prescribed burning on biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests in protected areas or under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternate levels of intervention were comparators. Relevant outcomes were species richness and diversity, excluding that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies were extracted from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update were undertaken using a strategy targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Grey literature and bibliographies of relevant published reviews were also searched for evidence. Studies were assessed for internal and external validity and data were extracted, using validity assessment and data extraction tools specifically designed for this review. Studies were presented in a narrative synthesis and interactive map, and those which were suitable were quantitatively synthesised using meta-analyses, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: Searches generated a total of 12,971 unique records. After screening for relevance, 244 studies (from 235 articles) were included in this review. Most studied forests were located in the USA (172/244), with the rest located in Canada, Europe and Australia. Eighty-two studies reporting 219 comparisons were included in the quantitative synthesis. Within the meta-analyses for each group of taxa, we identified a small to moderate volume of evidence, and heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Prescribed burning had significant positive effects on vascular plant richness, non-native vascular plant richness, and in broadleaf forests, herbaceous plant richness. Time since the burn, forest type and climate zone were significant moderators predicting the effect of burning on herbaceous plant richness. No other significant relationships were identified. Conclusions: Knowledge gaps exist for studies outside North America, in mixed forests and for non-plant organism outcomes. We identify a need to apply study designs consistently and appropriately, minimising the impact of confounding factors wherever possible, and to provide extensive detail in study reports. We recommend that researchers build long-term datasets charting the impacts of prescribed burning on succession. The lack of consistent findings was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators, and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. Rather than making any general recommendations on the use of prescribed burning for biodiversity restoration, we provide an evidence atlas of previous studies for researchers and practitioners to use. We observe that outcomes are still difficult to predict, and any restoration project should include a component of monitoring to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve conservation targets. Prescribed burning may have harmful effects on taxa that are conservation-dependent and careful planning is needed.","10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5","2047-2382","","ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE","1","","2047-2382",""

Most compound interactions occurred in North America and involved five or fewer years between disturbances. Common and interrelated disturbance legacies that facilitated compound interactions included reduced seed source availability, deadwood deposition and extraction, and increased light and growing space availability. Forest recovery was assessed with a diversity of metrics including woody and herbaceous plants, soil properties, and carbon stocks, which sometimes determined whether and what kind of compound interaction was detected. Distinctions between recovery time and trajectory, forest succession and development, and species-specific and community-level responses also influenced the detection and direction of compound interactions. Moving forward, we advocate a more holistic approach to quantify ecosystem recovery that considers multiple response variables. Other opportunities to improve compound disturbance ecology include increased emphasis on understudied disturbance types, regions, and forest types. We also encourage more research on buffering interactions that increase forest resilience, which were underrepresented in this review.","10.1002/ecs2.2962","2150-8925","","ECOSPHERE","11","","2150-8925",""

Successful use of arthropods in this capacity win require a systematic and rigorous process, including selection of potential indicators, definition of relationships between indicators and disturbance variables, optimization of the useful range of the indicator and application of the indicator(s) in monitoring. In Canada, the single greatest impediment to the use of arthropods as ecological indicators is the importance of accurate species-level identification and the difficulty achieving it. Consequently, most work has focused on a few relatively well-known groups (e.g., epigacic carabid and staphylinid beetles and spiders, saproxylic beetles, butterflies and larger night flying moths). Many recent studies have provided baseline data about the range of natural variation and have begun to quantify arthropod responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the context of preplanned experiments or through various retrospective approaches. Carabid beetles are the best-studied group and sufficient sets of data now exist to permit a meta-analysis of the robustness of carabids as indicators across multiple spatial scales and in terms of how well they represent broader ecological responses to disturbances. There is good potential to incorporate arthropod indicators into monitoring programs in Canada, but it is necessary to first complete a scientifically credible selection process for specific ecological indicators. Future research should focus on completing the process for taxa under current study as this develops the best presently understood opportunities for using arthropod indicators in assessing various aspects of environmental change. Researchers should also consider other means of monitoring arthropod biodiversity by the use of surrogate ecological parameters such as ecological land classification and habitat classification systems.","10.5558/tfc82344-3","0015-7546 and 1499-9315","","FORESTRY CHRONICLE","3","344","0015-7546 and 1499-9315",""

We conducted a systematic review by searching articles in the Web of Science related to the impacts of fire on the physicochemical water properties of freshwater ecosystems. We quantified the set of physicochemical parameters investigated and provided an overview of fire-mediated alterations. We found 54 articles published between 1976 and 2019, with a significant increase during the last decade. Research was strongly biased towards a few temperate western countries, mostly across North America, Europe and Australia. Lotic systems were considerably more studied than lentic systems. Overall, 57 chemical and 17 physical parameters were evaluated, comprising 304 and 77 cases, respectively. Fire altered 68 % of the cases studied and contingency tables showed that this alteration was proportionally similar between chemical (66 %) and physical (75 %) properties.

Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance-interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally. Insights First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications-i.e., from non-additive effects-between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio-ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date. Conclusions Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.","10.1111/geb.12772","1466-822X and 1466-8238","","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","10","1140","1466-822X and 1466-8238",""

Our review indicates that there are few studies that compare residue management and treatment options, considering the variety of impacts and effects that can be generated. This is surprising as residue management affects residue quantity and distribution and is relevant for numerous ecological processes. The retention of fine and coarse residues can generate positive effects and impacts on various aspects of forest ecosystems including (i) biodiversity, by promoting stand regeneration and providing habitats for fauna at different levels; (ii) soil properties, by decreasing the risk of erosion and soil compaction while retaining moisture at ground level; and (iii) soil nutrients, by replenishing C, N, and micronutrient stocks.

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies testing different models and adaptations for the prediction of post-fire soil erosion. However, many of these adaptations are being applied without field validation or model performance assessment. Therefore, this study aims to describe the scientific advances in the last 20 years in post-fire soil erosion modelling research and evaluate model adaptations to burned areas that aim to include: (i) fire-induced changes in soil and ground cover; (ii) fire-induced changes in infiltration; (iii) burn severity; and (iv) mitigation measures in their predictions. This study also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, suggests potential improvements, and identifies directions for future research. Results show that studies are not homogeneously distributed worldwide, according to the model type used or by region most affected by wildfire. During calibration, 73% of cases involved model adaptation to burned conditions, and only 21% attempted to accommodate new processes. Burn severity was addressed in 75% of cases, whilst mitigation measures were simulated in 27%. Additionally, only a minor percentage of model predictions were validated with independent field data (17%) or assessed for uncertainties (13%). Therefore, further efforts are required in the adaptation of erosion models to burned conditions, to be widely used for post-fire management decisions. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, since 2010, the decreasing trends of fine particles and premature deaths have reversed to increase in the western USA (55% increase in PM2 center dot 5, 86% increase in black carbon, and increase of 670 premature deaths [460-810]), while remaining mostly unchanged in the eastern USA. The western USA showed large interannual fluctuations that were attributable to the increasing incidence of wildfires. Furthermore, the black carbon-to-PM2 center dot 5 mass ratio increased annually by 2 center dot 4% across the USA, mainly due to increasing wildfire emissions in the western USA and more rapid reductions of other components in the eastern USA, suggesting a potential increase in the relative toxicity of PM2 center dot 5. 100% of populated areas in the USA have experienced at least one day of PM2 center dot 5 pollution exceeding the daily air quality guideline level of 15 jig/m3 during 2000-2020, with 99% experiencing at least 7 days and 85% experiencing at least 30 days. The recent widespread wildfires have greatly increased the daily exposure risks in the western USA, and have also impacted the midwestern USA due to the long-range transport of smoke. Interpretation Wildfires have become increasingly intensive and frequent in the western USA, resulting in a significant increase in smoke-related emissions in populated areas. This increase is likely to have contributed to a decline in air quality and an increase in attributable mortality. Reducing fire risk via effective policies besides mitigation of climate warming, such as wildfire prevention and management, forest restoration, and new revenue generation, could substantially improve air quality and public health in the coming decades.

Though the effects of wildfire on free-living aquatic communities are relatively well-studied, how host-parasite interactions respond to fire disturbance is largely unexplored. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact design, we surveyed 10 stream sites (5 burned and 5 unburned) in the Willamette River Basin, Oregon and quantified snail host infection status and trematode parasite community structure 1 year before and two years after historic wildfires. Despite the severity of the wildfires, snail host populations did not show significant shifts in density or size distributions. We detected nine taxa of trematode parasites and overall probability of infection remained consistent over the three-year study period. However, at the taxon-specific level, we found evidence that infection probability by one trematode decreased and another increased after fire. In a larger dataset focusing on the first year after fire (9 burned, 8 unburned sites), we found evidence for subtle differences in trematode community structure, including higher Shannon diversity and evenness at the burned sites. Taken together, host-parasite interactions were remarkably stable for most taxa; for trematodes that did show responses, changes in abundance or behavior of definitive hosts may underlie observed patterns. These results have implications for using parasites as bioindicators of environmental change and suggest that aquatic snail-trematode interactions may be relatively resistant to wildfire disturbance in some ecosystems.","10.1007/s00442-023-05422-w","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","","OECOLOGIA","2","401","0029-8549 and 1432-1939",""

Despite recommendations for research on the role of the microsite environment for oak regeneration, very little is known about the interacting effects of fire, soil, and surrounding plant community on oak establishment. We collected undisturbed and burned soil in the aftermath of a wildfire in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and used amplicon sequencing to identify differences in composition of bacterial and fungal communities between unburned and burned soils. To assess the effects of plant community, fire-induced shifts in soil microbial communities, and their interaction we conducted a glasshouse experiment and grew Quercus velutina seedlings in factorial treatments of plant neighbor (oak vs. pine seedling) and soil burn status (unburned vs. burned soil). Fire reduced the diversity of plant pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi and reduced the relative abundance of plant pathogenic fungi. Fire did not affect soil bacterial communities. Shifts in soil fungal community composition enhanced oak seedling root growth, but the effect of the soil microbiome was mediated by plant neighbor interactions. Seedling root growth was negatively correlated with diversity of pathogenic fungi. Root growth was enhanced in burned soil relative to unburned soil, but only when growing with a pine seedling neighbor as opposed to an oak seedling neighbor. Results from this study show that interactions between soil microbes and nearby plants can in part mediate oak seedling growth. As such, nuanced decisions that consider the ecological interactions of the microsite environment are needed to achieve desired outcomes for oak regeneration.","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119774","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

Fire is one such perturbation that causes significant disruption by causing mortality and altering habitats and resources for animals. Fire regimes are changing on a global scale, but the effects of these changes on animal communities are poorly understood. Arthropods are one of the most ubiquitous and diverse animal taxa on the planet and their populations are sensitive to environmental change. Given their wide-ranging impacts on ecosystem functioning, a better understanding of arthropod responses to changing fire regimes is critical and may also provide more general insights into how other groups might respond to fire. Here, we provide a comprehensive meta-analytical assessment of how fire influences the arthropod community across habitats and functional groups. Using data from 130 peer-reviewed papers across the globe, we tested how a variety of fire characteristics, including management regime, severity and time-since-fire affect arthropod populations and communities across habitats. Our results show that arthropod communities display substantial variation in response to fire and that community-level responses are most likely to be detected within the first year. Responses also vary depending on fire characteristics and habitat. Specifically, while community metrics such as diversity were increased by low severity fires, they were reduced by high severity fires. Likewise, evenness increased after prescribed burns but was reduced after wildfire. Measures of arthropod community structure decreased following fires in deserts and forests. Across the entire arthropod community, fire also had variable effects on community diversity. Fire tended to have a negative effect size on arthropods across life stages, but responses did vary among groups. Nearly all functional groups exhibited a negative response to fire with the exception of herbivores, for which abundance, diversity and richness increased after fire. Our results suggest that the increasing prevalence of high-severity wildfires are changing the structure of arthropod communities. Given their ubiquitous presence and diverse roles in terrestrial ecosystems, these community changes are likely to affect ecosystem functioning in various ways, including through increased herbivory.

The 2019-20 bushfire season in Australia burnt 5.4 million hectares of land in New South Wales alone, with smoke so severe it affected cities in Argentina, 11,000 km away. The smoke emitted by bushfires consists of both gaseous and particle components. It is important to note that exposure to particulate matter has been shown to be linked to a heightened risk of stroke, which is the primary kind of cerebrovascular illness, as well as an increased likelihood of hospitalisations and mortality. However, the available data is inadequate in terms of documenting the response of patients diagnosed with a proven cerebrovascular illness to bushfire smoke. Additionally, there is a lack of information about the health effects associated with particulate matter throughout the bushfire season and on days when smoke was present in 2019 and 2020. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of (i) short-term air pollution triggered by bushfires and (ii) high smoke days in increasing the daily number of hospital admissions with cerebrovascular diseases. Materials and Methods: Hospitalisation data were accessed from the admitted patient dataset from seven local Government areas of Hunter New England Local Health District. The bushfire period was defined from 1 October 2019 to 10 February 2020, and a same period from 2018-19 as the control. High bushfire smoke days were days when the average daily concentration of particulate matter was higher than the 95th percentile of the control period. Poisson regression models and fixed effect meta-analysis were used to analyse the data. Results: In total, 275 patients with cerebrovascular admissions were identified, with 147 (53.5%) during the bushfire (2019-20) and 128 (46.5%) in the control period (2018-19). There was no significant increase in daily admissions for cerebrovascular disease (Incidence Rate Ratio, IRR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.81-1.34; p-value: 0.73), acute stroke (IRR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.88-1.50; p-value: 0.29) or acute ischaemic stroke (IRR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.87-1.59; p-value: 0.28), over the entire bushfire period. However, the high bushfire smoke days were associated with increased acute ischaemic stroke-related hospital admissions across lead 0-3 and the highest cumulative effect was observed with lead 0 (IRR:1.52; 95% CI: 1.01-2.29; p-value: 0.04). In addition, during the bushfire period, particulate matter, both PM10 and PM2.5 (defined as particulates that have an effective aerodynamic diameter of 10, and 2.5 microns, respectively), were also associated with increased acute ischaemic stroke admissions with a lag of 0-3 days. Discussion and Conclusion: The results suggested a possible association between particulate matter and high smoke days with increased hospital admissions due to acute ischaemic stroke during the recent Australian bushfire season.","10.1177/23969873231223307","2396-9873 and 2396-9881","","EUROPEAN STROKE JOURNAL","2","468","2396-9873 and 2396-9881",""

This comprehensive assessment offers an in-depth overview of disaster management systems, methods, obstacles, and potential future paths. Specifically, it focuses on flood control, a significant and recurrent category of natural disasters. The analysis begins by exploring various types of natural catastrophes, including earthquakes, wildfires, and floods. It then delves into the different domains that collectively contribute to effective flood management. These domains encompass cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis and cloud computing, providing scalable and reliable infrastructure for data storage, processing, and analysis. The study investigates the potential of the Internet of Things and sensor networks to gather real-time data from flood-prone areas, enhancing situational awareness and enabling prompt actions. Model-driven engineering is examined for its utility in developing and modeling flood scenarios, aiding in preparation and response planning. This study includes the Google Earth engine (GEE) and examines previous studies involving GEE. Moreover, we discuss remote sensing; remote sensing is undoubtedly a valuable tool for disaster management, and offers geographical data in various situations. We explore the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Spatial Data Management for visualizing and analyzing spatial data and facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation during floods. In the final section, the focus shifts to the utilization of machine learning and data analytics in flood management. These methodologies offer predictive models and data-driven insights, enhancing early warning systems, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies. Through this in-depth analysis, the significance of incorporating these spheres into flood control procedures is highlighted, with the aim of improving disaster management techniques and enhancing resilience in flood-prone regions. The paper addresses existing challenges and provides future research directions, ultimately striving for a clearer and more coherent representation of disaster management techniques.","10.3390/land12081514","2073-445X","","LAND","8","","2073-445X",""

The present paper systematically reviews the role of forensic odontologists in various global MDs. Method A comprehensive search of the literature databases (PubMed, Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar), along with cross-referencing published peer-reviewed articles, was conducted. The search included full texts, abstracts or titles, had no inclusion year limit (searched until September 2017) and was limited to the English language. Keywords included a combination of 'Forensic odontology', 'Dental records', 'Victim identification', `Natural mass disaster', 'Criminal mass disaster', 'Accidental mass disaster' and 'Victim disaster'. Results Of the included disasters (20), 12 (57.14%) were accidental, 5 (23.80%) natural and 3 (19.04%) were criminal. The maximum number of victims was associated with the Japan tsunami (15892), followed by the Thailand tsunami (4280) and the Estonia ferry disaster (852). A total of 23654 victims were reported, of which 20569 (86.96%) were positively identified. Reports from 17 MDs included the use of FO in victim identification [3025 (14.70%) cases]. In addition, 1094 victims (5.31%; from 7 papers) were identified using FO in combination with other methodologies. The highest percentage of victims was identified using FO following the Kentucky air crash (47; 100%), followed by the Newark air crash (38; 76%), the Nepal air crash (10; 71.42%), the France air crash (56; 65.88%), the Australian bushfire (14; 63.63%), and the Estonia ferry disaster (57; 60.63%). Conclusion FO has played a significant role in victim identification in several MDs around the world. The success of FO-based identification is heavily dependent on the availability of ante-mortem records from general dental practitioners. Hence, adequate knowledge about FO and appropriate dental record keeping among general dental practitioners are critical.","10.1371/journal.pone.0199791","1932-6203","","PLOS ONE","6","","1932-6203",""

In some countries, however, the use of bioenergy ash as a nutrient-rich forest soil amendment is strongly encouraged. Given that forest management in Canada is often driven by the 'emulation of natural disturbance' paradigm, bioenergy ash could have potential as a management tool for improving wildfire emulation in harvested stands. We compared published values of wildfire ash chemistry with those for Canadian and European bioenergy ash and found that they are similar. We used meta-analysis to examine changes in soil carbon and nitrogen pools, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable calcium and soil pH following wildfires and applications of bioenergy ash on upland forested sites. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash can reduce forest floor C and N pools: wildfires by direct combustion of organic matter, and ash applications by an apparent increase in organic matter decay. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash applications increase extractable P, exchangeable Ca and pH in surface mineral soils. Although bioenergy ash applications can trigger larger increases in available P and pH in surface mineral soils than wildfires, controlling ash dosage rates or pre-treating the ash to slow the rate of nutrient release could attenuate some of these effects.","10.2136/sssaj2018.10.0380","0361-5995 and 1435-0661","","SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL","","S201","0361-5995 and 1435-0661",""

The approach has been applied in the wake of natural and human-made disasters in more than 30 countries. Four tiers of energy psychology interventions following the establishment of safety, trust, and rapport are described, including (1) immediate relief/stabilization, (2) reducing limbic arousal to trauma-based triggers, (3) overcoming complex psychological difficulties, and (4) promoting optimal functioning. The first tier is most pertinent in psychological first aid immediately following a disaster, with the subsequent tiers progressively being introduced over time with complex stress reactions and chronic disorders. Advantages of adding the stimulation of acupuncture points to a conventional exposure approach are identified, and challenges around cultural sensitivities and unintended effects are discussed. After establishing a framework for introducing energy psychology in disaster relief efforts, reports from a sampling of settings are presented, based on interviews with this paper's author. These include accounts of relief work with survivors of mass shootings, genocide, ethnic warfare, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

To examine the influence of microclimates on Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) nest site selection and nest success in a fire-affected landscape, we measured black bulb temperature (T-bb) and vegetation attributes (e.g., visual obstruction) at 3 spatial scales (i.e. nest bowl, microsite, and landscape) in unburned and burned areas. Nest bowls exhibited greater buffering of T-bb than both nearby microsites and the broader landscape. Notably, nest bowls were warmer in cold temperatures, and cooler in hot temperatures, than nearby microsites and the broader landscape, regardless of burn stage. Nest survival (NS) was higher for nests in unburned areas compared to nests in burned areas (unburned NS = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33-0.54; burned NS = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.46).

Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. Objective: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. Methods: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart. Results: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. Conclusions: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents.

However, overall trends for fungal response to fire, which can be especially critical in a post-fire context, have been difficult to elucidate. We used meta-analytical techniques to investigate fungal response to fire across studies, ecosystems, and fire types. Change in fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization were used as the effect size metrics in random effects models. When different types of methods for assessing fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization were considered together, there was an average reduction of 28 % in fungal species richness post fire, but no significant response in mycorrhizal colonization. In contrast, there was a 41 % reduction in fungal species richness post fire when assessed by sporocarp surveys, but fungal species richness was not significantly affected when assessed by molecular methods. Measured in situ, fire reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 21 %, yet no significant response occurred when assessed by ex situ bioassays. These findings suggest that the putative magnitude of fire effects on soil fungal communities may be dependent on the approach and assessment method used. Furthermore, biome, but not fire type (i.e., wildfire versus prescribed fire) was a significant moderator of our categorical models, suggesting that biome might be a more useful predictor of fungal species richness response to fire than fire type. Reductions in fungal species richness and in situ mycorrhizal colonization post fire declined logarithmically and approached zero (i.e., no effect) at 22 and 11 years, respectively. We concluded that fire reduces fungal species richness and in situ mycorrhizal colonization, but if conditions allow communities to recover (e.g., without subsequent disturbance, favorable growing conditions), soil fungi are resilient on decadal time scales; the resiliency of soil fungi likely contributes to the overall rapid ecosystem recovery following fire.","10.4996/fireecology.130237746","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","2","37","1933-9747",""

We find that the direct impacts of climate change on forests, represented by changes in dieback and forest growth, and indirect effects due to lost crop productivity, together result in a net gain of 17 Gt C in aboveground forest carbon storage from 2000 to 2100. Increases in climate-driven forest growth rates will result in an 81%-99% reduction in costs of reaching a range of global forest carbon stock targets in 2100, while the increases in dieback rates are projected to raise the costs by 57%-132%. When combined, these two direct impacts are expected to reduce the global costs of climate change mitigation in forests by more than 70%. Inclusion of the third, indirect impact of climate change on forests through reduction in crop yields, and the resulting expansion of cropland, raises the costs by 11%-38% and widens the uncertainty range. While we cannot rule out the possibility of climate change increasing mitigation costs, the central outcomes of the simultaneous impacts of climate change on forests and agriculture are 64%-86% reductions in the mitigation costs. Overall, the results suggest that concerns about climate driven dieback in forests should not inhibit the ambitions of policy makers in expanding forest-based climate solutions.","10.1088/1748-9326/ac8ec5","1748-9326","","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","10","","1748-9326",""

To measure community shifts caused by these princess tree invasions across burn areas, we sampled vegetation in paired invaded and noninvaded plots in mature and immature invasions within two burn areas of the LGWA. Plant community composition shifted in response to princess tree invasion across all invasion stages and burn areas. Species richness and Shannon diversity values decreased in invaded plots. Overall community structure also differed in invaded plots within immature invasions (P = 0.004). The distribution of princess tree age classes in both burn areas indicates that fire promotes invasion but is not necessary for subsequent recruitment. Additionally, preliminary genetic analyses among distinct princess tree populations revealed very low genetic diversity, suggesting that a single introduction may have occurred in the LGWA. This information regarding community shift and strong post-fire recruitment by princess tree may inform management decisions by prioritizing princess tree control immediately after wildfires and immediately before and after prescribed burns.","10.1017/inp.2017.14","1939-7291 and 1939-747X","","INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT","2","125","1939-7291 and 1939-747X",""

The results provide preliminary evidence of the program's effectiveness in reducing distress, insomnia, and functional impairment, and in increasing perceived social support and quality of life. Introduction: Many disaster and trauma survivors experience persistent subclinical distress that places them at risk of developing a mental health disorder. This study describes the first European feasibility study of a brief and scalable skills-based intervention targeting persistent subclinical distress following disasters and trauma. Method: Randomized controlled feasibility study of the Skills fOr Life Adjustment and Resilience (SOLAR) group program. German trauma survivors (N = 30) with subclinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder or functional impairment, but no current mental disorder other than adjustment disorder, were randomized to the SOLAR group program (n = 15) or to a wait-list control group (n = 15). The primary outcome was feasibility, operationalized through eligibility rate, recruitment speed, treatment adherence, dropout rate, and participant satisfaction with the program. Secondary outcomes were psychological distress, symptoms of insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, patient-centered outcomes, quality of life, and perceived social support. Results: Eligibility rate was 33.6%; recruitment speed was two days per participant; 92.9% completed at least four of five sessions; dropout rate was 10.0%; 92.3% were ""very satisfied"" with the program. Between-group change scores showed a large effect size for patient-centered outcomes. Medium effect sizes were found for symptoms of insomnia, perceived social support, and quality of life. Small effects were identified for reductions in distress and functional impairment. Discussion: The application of the SOLAR group program within a randomized controlled trial was feasible.

In our study area, urban exotic plants were less flammable than wildland and urban native plants.

Biodiversity response to disturbance also depends on the community characteristics and habitat requirements of species. Untangling the mechanistic interplay of these factors has guided disturbance ecology for decades, generating mixed scientific evidence of biodiversity responses to disturbance. Understanding the impact of natural disturbances on biodiversity is increasingly important due to human-induced changes in natural disturbance regimes. In many areas, major natural forest disturbances, such as wildfires, windstorms, and insect outbreaks, are becoming more frequent, intense, severe, and widespread due to climate change and land-use change. Conversely, the suppression of natural disturbances threatens disturbance-dependent biota. Using a meta-analytic approach, we analysed a global data set (with most sampling concentrated in temperate and boreal secondary forests) of species assemblages of 26 taxonomic groups, including plants, animals, and fungi collected from forests affected by wildfires, windstorms, and insect outbreaks. The overall effect of natural disturbances on alpha-diversity did not differ significantly from zero, but some taxonomic groups responded positively to disturbance, while others tended to respond negatively. Disturbance was beneficial for taxonomic groups preferring conditions associated with open canopies (e.g. hymenopterans and hoverflies), whereas ground-dwelling groups and/or groups typically associated with shady conditions (e.g. epigeic lichens and mycorrhizal fungi) were more likely to be negatively impacted by disturbance. Across all taxonomic groups, the highest alpha-diversity in disturbed forest patches occurred under moderate disturbance severity, i.e. with approximately 55% of trees killed by disturbance. We further extended our meta-analysis by applying a unified diversity concept based on Hill numbers to estimate alpha-diversity changes in different taxonomic groups across a gradient of disturbance severity measured at the stand scale and incorporating other disturbance features. We found that disturbance severity negatively affected diversity for Hill number q = 0 but not for q = 1 and q = 2, indicating that diversity-disturbance relationships are shaped by species relative abundances. Our synthesis of alpha-diversity was extended by a synthesis of disturbance-induced change in species assemblages, and revealed that disturbance changes the beta-diversity of multiple taxonomic groups, including some groups that were not affected at the alpha-diversity level (birds and woody plants). Finally, we used mixed rarefaction/extrapolation to estimate biodiversity change as a function of the proportion of forests that were disturbed, i.e. the disturbance extent measured at the landscape scale. The comparison of intact and naturally disturbed forests revealed that both types of forests provide habitat for unique species assemblages, whereas species diversity in the mixture of disturbed and undisturbed forests peaked at intermediate values of disturbance extent in the simulated landscape. Hence, the relationship between alpha-diversity and disturbance severity in disturbed forest stands was strikingly similar to the relationship between species richness and disturbance extent in a landscape consisting of both disturbed and undisturbed forest habitats. This result suggests that both moderate disturbance severity and moderate disturbance extent support the highest levels of biodiversity in contemporary forest landscapes.","10.1111/brv.12876","1464-7931 and 1469-185X","","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS","5","1930","1464-7931 and 1469-185X",""

Mycorrhizas constitute a potential restoration tool for this species. Firstly, in a greenhouse we tested A. araucana growth responses to single/mixed commercial and native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculum. Secondly, in plantations under contrasting tree covers we compared the growth responses of greenhouse-grown A. araucana seedlings with and without native AMF inoculum. Four treatments were established under greenhouse conditions (25 A. araucana seedlings per treatment): T0, non-mycorrhizal control; T1, single AMF species commercial inoculum; T2, four AMF species commercial inoculum; and T3, 17 AMF species native inoculum. Seedlings were grown for 1.5 years, after which, seven growth traits and the Ritchie plant quality index were recorded. After this, in Nahuelbuta National Park (native inoculum and seeds' site), a total of 80 seedlings were sown for 13 months: 40 from T0 and 40 from T3, in two contrasting plots regarding their tree mycorrhizal dominance (ectomycorrhizal vs. arbuscular mycorrhizal). Under greenhouse conditions, native AMF inoculum, over one and four species' commercial inoculum, increased A. araucana seedlings' fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots. In situ, the sympatric combination of native seedlings and AMF inoculum growing under original soil conditions, resulted in higher plant growth and quality. Functional complementarity among AMF species probably explains our greenhouse results, as inoculum complexity is a good predictor of plant performance. Local adaptation of AMF and seedlings to soil biotic/abiotic conditions might explain our plantation results.","10.1007/s42729-023-01501-2","0718-9508 and 0718-9516","","JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION","4","6459","0718-9508 and 0718-9516",""

They can maintain ephemeral habitat, alter local and landscape biodiversity, drive carbon balance changes and trigger whole ecosystem regime shifts. Yet, there are few theories and only limited frameworks underlying disturbance ecology by which scientists and practitioners can anticipate the impacts of novel disturbances or changes in disturbance regimes. Much of the challenge in developing and testing theories lies in the diversity of ecosystems and disturbance processes and the general inability to (a) properly replicate studies and (b) compare results across disparate systems, from bacterial communities to boreal forests. General syntheses of disturbance processes have identified key aspects of disturbance impact and response-resource stock change, resource flux change, spatial dynamics and trait diversity-that should apply across systems. Yet, application and testing remain challenging due to a lack of a common set of metrics and baselines for comparisons across systems. Here, I propose a discipline-wide effort to develop and publish standardized metrics (in addition to study-specific data) such that the field as a whole can build and test general theory that works across ecological systems. Ten metrics spanning event type, location/design data and biotic composition comprise this suite of 'minimum descriptors' and are directly derived from current disturbance ecology theory. Several examples of cross-system applicability, from bacterial studies to palaeoecological disturbances, are noted. These are example metrics, intended to open the conversation about the most appropriate and theory-based lines of commonality across the field, and they may be further refined through cross-disciplinary conversation. The result of standardizing metrics will be a coordinated dataset that allows for inter-system testing of theory, meaning disturbance ecology studies can move past disparate, seemingly unique systems with little replication to integrated research. To phrase it in another way, disturbance ecology studies should be planned, in part, to contribute to future quantitative meta-analyses. If done, we (as a community) will be much better prepared to address the challenges of emerging disturbances, novel ecosystems, and no-analogue changes in disturbance regimes which are anticipated with climate change and increasing human pressures.","10.1111/2041-210X.13702","2041-210X and 2041-2096","","METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","12","2276","2041-210X and 2041-2096",""

However, knowledge on broad-scale patterns of ecosystem and organism responses to fires is still scarce. Through a systematic quantitative review of available studies across South America, we assessed fire effects on biodiversity and abundance of different organisms (i.e., plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates), plant fitness, and soil properties under four climate types, and time since the last fire (i.e., early and late post fire). We addressed: (1) What fire effects have been studied across South America? (2) What are the overall responses of biodiversity, abundance, fitness, and soil properties to fires? (3) How do climate and time since fire modulate those responses? Results We analyzed 160 articles reporting 1465 fire responses on paired burned and unburned conditions. We found no effect of fire on biodiversity or on invertebrate abundance, a negative effect on woody plant species and vertebrate abundance, and an increase in shrub fitness. Soil in burned areas had higher bulk density and pH, and lower organic matter and nitrogen. Fire effect was significantly more positive at early than at late post fire for plant fitness and for soil phosphorus and available nitrogen. Stronger negative effects in semiarid climate compared to humid warm climate suggest that higher temperatures and water availability allow a faster ecosystem recovery after fire. Conclusions Our review highlights the complexity of the climate-fire-vegetation feedback when assessing the response of soil properties and different organisms at various levels. The resilience observed in biodiversity may be expected considering the large number of fire-prone ecosystems in South America. The recovery of invertebrate abundance, the reduction of the vertebrate abundance, and the loss of nitrogen and organic matter coincide with the responses found in global reviews at early post-fire times. The strength of these responses was further influenced by climate type and post-fire time. Our synthesis provides the first broad-scale diagnosis of fire effects in South America, helping to visualize strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in fire research. It also brings much needed information for developing adequate land management in a continent where fire plays a prominent socio-ecological role.","10.1186/s42408-021-00100-9","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","1","","1933-9747",""

From the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network, data on daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths were obtained from 749 locations in 43 countries or areas, representing overlapping periods from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016. We estimated the daily concentration of wildfire-related O-3 in study locations using a chemical transport model, and then calibrated and downscaled O-3 estimates to a resolution of 0<middle dot>25 degrees x 0<middle dot>25 degrees (approximately 28 km 2 at the equator). Using a random-effects meta-analysis, we examined the associations of short-term wildfire-related O-3 exposure (lag period of 0-2 days) with daily mortality, first at the location level and then pooled at the country, regional, and global levels. Annual excess mortality fraction in each location attributable to wildfire-related O-3 was calculated with pooled effect estimates and used to obtain excess mortality fractions at country, regional, and global levels. Findings Between 2000 and 2016, the highest maximum daily wildfire-related O-3 concentrations (>= 30 mu g/m( 3 )) were observed in locations in South America, central America, and southeastern Asia, and the country of South Africa. Across all locations, an increase of 1 mu g/m( 3) in the mean daily concentration of wildfire-related O-3 during lag 0-2 days was associated with increases of 0<middle dot>55% (95% CI 0<middle dot>29 to 0<middle dot>80) in daily all-cause mortality, 0<middle dot>44% (-0<middle dot>10 to 0<middle dot>99) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0<middle dot>82% (0<middle dot>18 to 1<middle dot>47) in daily respiratory mortality. The associations of daily mortality rates with wildfire-related O-3 exposure showed substantial geographical heterogeneity at the country and regional levels. Across all locations, estimated annual excess mortality fractions of 0<middle dot>58% (95% CI 0<middle dot>31 to 0<middle dot>85; 31 606 deaths [95% CI 17 038 to 46 027]) for all-cause mortality, 0<middle dot>41% (-0<middle dot>10 to 0<middle dot>91; 5249 [-1244 to 11 620]) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0<middle dot>86% (0<middle dot>18 to 1<middle dot>51; 4657 [999 to 8206]) for respiratory mortality were attributable to short-term exposure to wildfire-related O-3 . Interpretation In this study, we observed an increase in all-cause and respiratory mortality associated with short-term wildfire-related O-3 exposure. Effective risk and smoke management strategies should be implemented to protect the public from the impacts of wildfires. Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid the negative impacts of wildfire, prescribed fire is applied in several environments, often with post-fire soil mulching, to control wildfire hazard and erosion in burned areas. However, uncertainties remain about impacts of these forest management techniques on post-fire regeneration, especially for some forest species, such as oak, which is predominant in Mediterranean fire-prone areas. This study evaluates the effects of prescribed fire and post-fire soil mulching with fern on initial recruitment of an oak forest of Southern Italy. Acorn emergence and seedling survival as well as some important plant and root biometric characteristics (height, diameter, and dry weight) have been monitored in plots burned by prescribed fire with or without post-fire treatment with fern. The acorn rain among the experimental conditions was not statistically different, whereas the prescribed fire significantly increased acorn emergence compared to the unburned area. About 30% of acorns germinated, of which more than 70% survived. Soil mulching with fern did not significantly increase acorn emergence (35%) and plant survival (85%) compared to the burned and untreated sites, presumably due to the shadowing effect of the cut fern, which reduces the light availability for juvenile plants.

These contrasting effects in part support the initial hypothesis that soil mulching may be synergistic with the prescribed fire.

This vole is a common inhabitant of moist meadows, grasslands, and early successional sites after forest clearcutting and wildfire and may damage plantation trees on reforestation sites. We tested three hypotheses (H) that populations of M. pennsylvanicus would (H1) increase in abundance and potentially fluctuate owing to the availability of early seral post-harvest habitats associated with cumulative clearcut harvesting; and (H2) be positively associated with mean cover of herbaceous vegetation on clearcut sites; and (H3) be at lower abundance when the long-tailed vole (M. longicaudus) is present at higher numbers. Overall, mean abundances of M. pennsylvanicus were generally low, and hence differences among Periods were not formally significant. Thus, H1, that meadow voles would increase in abundance on new clearcuts was not supported, except for Period 2 with the highest mean density recorded at 14.3 voles/ha. There was some evidence of a 4-year multi-annual fluctuation in 1998 and 2002 in Period 2. Mean ground cover of total herbs, grasses, and shrubs were similar in Periods 2 and 3. However, meadow vole populations were dramatically different in these two Periods, with few meadow voles captured in Period 3 and then a decline to extirpation in Period 4. Thus, H2 was supported for Period 2, but not Period 3. Both species of voles were present at similarly low numbers (< 5/ha) with fewer meadow voles in the three years of peak numbers (22-33/ha) of long-tailed voles, and hence this pattern provided weak support for H3. The lack of increases in meadow vole numbers post-cutting in Periods 1, 3, and 4 may have been related to very high numbers of M. longicaudus in Period 1 and possibly the advent of cattle grazing and drought conditions in Periods 3 and 4. Although the decline in Microtus on post-harvest forest sites may be beneficial for pest management and reforestation, such declines may have serious consequences for predator communities, biodiversity, and other ecological functions.","10.1007/s13364-024-00746-1","2199-2401 and 2199-241X","","MAMMAL RESEARCH","","","2199-2401 and 2199-241X",""

The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of UAV-based forest-fire-extinguishing activity (FFEA) operations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted to answer a specific set of questions, which were carefully formulated to address the results of research conducted between 2008 and 2021. This study aims to (i) expand our understanding of the development of UAVs and their current contributions to the FFEA; (ii) identify particularly novel or unique applications and characteristics of UAV-based fire-extinguishing systems; (iii) provide guidance for exploring and revising further ideas in this field by identifying under-researched topics and other areas in which more contributions are needed; and (iv) explore the feasibility of using UAV swarms to enable autonomous firefighting in the forest without human intervention. Of the 1353 articles systematically searched across five databases (Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Scopus, and IEEE Explore), 51 highly relevant articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria; therefore, they were analyzed and discussed. The results identified several gaps in this field of study among them the complexity of coordination in multi-robotic systems, the lack of evaluation and implementation of fire extinguishing systems, the inability of handling multiple spot fires, and poor management of time and resources. Finally, based on the conducted review, this paper provides significant research directions that require further investigations by researchers in this field including, the deployment of UAV-based Swarm Robotics, further study on the characteristics of the fire extinguishing systems; design more effective area coverage; and the propose of a self-firefighting model that enables individuals to decide on the course of events efficiently and locally for better utilization and management of time and resources.","10.3390/f13050811","1999-4907","","FORESTS","5","","1999-4907",""

Therefore, a global meta-analysis of 371 cases from 81 published studies was conducted to explore the comprehensive effects of fires on soil microbial properties. The results show that fires significantly increased microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2), by 19.45% on average, and decreased soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 8.41% and fungal biomass by 27.17%. Moreover, the response of these microbial indices to fires intensified with increasing fire intensity. In addition, ecosystem types and climate zones have an impact on the response of MBC and qCO2 to fires. Among them, MBC and qCO2 in coniferous forests and continental climate zones are the most sensitive to fires. A correlation analysis displayed that the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to fires was significantly and positively correlated with the response of MBC but negatively correlated with the response of qCO2. Furthermore, fires reduced SOC in the short term, but had no significant impact in the long term.

The need to analyze these modern digital data motivated research to accelerate remote-sensing image classification. Fortunately, great advances have been made by the computer vision community to classify natural images or photographs taken with an ordinary camera. Natural image datasets can range up to millions of samples and are, therefore, amenable to deep-learning techniques. Many fields of science, remote sensing included, were able to exploit the success of natural image classification by convolutional neural network models using a technique commonly called transfer learning. We provide a systematic review of transfer learning application for scene classification using different datasets and different deep-learning models. We evaluate how the specialization of convolutional neural network models affects the transfer learning process by splitting original models in different points. As expected, we find the choice of hyperparameters used to train the model has a significant influence on the final performance of the models. Curiously, we find transfer learning from models trained on larger, more generic natural images datasets outperformed transfer learning from models trained directly on smaller remotely sensed datasets.

Lichen persistence, growth, and colonization were examined by reviewing studies on e.g. edge-effects, lichen transplants, and logging experiments. Recovery rates were examined by reviewing studies on relationships between lichen diversity and stand age. The results from the reviewed studies were analysed by various meta-analysis methods. The review showed e.g. overall negative effects of disturbance on lichen persistence, but that persistence depend on the magnitude of the disturbance (e.g. forest edge orientation and clear-cut size). However, many lichens seem to persist disturbance, and growth rates were as good in disturbed as in intact forest. The review also showed that lichen populations may need long time to recover, but that species richness does not necessarily increase over time. However, disturbance origin (logging or natural disturbance) is important to explain lichen diversity but is often confounded with stand age. The results are promising for the potential to restore and maintain lichen diversity by forest management methods based on natural disturbance regimes. Further research is needed to e.g. separate the effects of time since disturbance and disturbance type, to examine edge-effects under varying edge conditions, and to examine the influence of landscape context on stand level lichen diversity.

Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both.

The last decade has seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires that is threatening these source watersheds, and necessitating more expensive water treatment to address degrading water quality. Given increasing wildfire frequency in a changing climate, it is important to understand the magnitude of water quality impacts following fire. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore post-fire changes in the concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) species, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended sediments in 121 sites around the world. Changes were documented over each study's respective duration, which for 90% of sites was five years or fewer. We find concurrent increases in C, N and P species, highlighting a tight coupling between biogeochemical cycles in post-fire landscapes. We find that fire alters N and P speciation, with median increases of 40%-60% in the proportion of soluble inorganic N and P relative to total N and P. We also found that fire decreases C:N and C:P ratios, with median decreases ranging from 60% to 70%. Finally we observe a 'hockey stick'-like response in changes to the concentration distribution, where increases in the highest concentration ranges are much greater than increases at lower concentrations. Our study documents strong heterogeneity in responses of water quality to wildfire that have been unreported so far in the literature.","10.1088/1748-9326/ac6a6c","1748-9326","","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","6","","1748-9326",""

Some regions are experiencing and will experience severe decline in their water resources due to prolonged periods of drought. Since emergency practices such as the provision of emergency drinking water and forest firefighting depend on regional surface and groundwater resources, the safety of the hydro geosphere's of a region is of fundamental importance, especially in times of crisis. The study uniquely addresses the integration of emergency water management within broader sustainable practices, particularly in the German context where such an analysis has not been previously consolidated. Using the example of emergency drinking water management, the paper elaborates the extent to which measures of emergency response are currently recognised as part of sustainable water management. In an analysis, 79 documents addressing emergency drinking water management of both water supply companies and crisis management authorities in Germany were analysed. The findings revealed a general lack of documents addressing the long-term dependencies between water resources and emergency measures currently applied. Furthermore, the documents do not elaborate on how to implement these measures in a sustainable way recognising the distinctive characteristics of a region. Since response measures can potentially intensify water stress in a region, emergency water management must be consequently included in a holistic water management process to protect landscapes and communities for the future. This paper provides a first comprehensive compilation of essential documents dealing with emergency drinking water management in Germany. It furthermore introduces a new approach to emergency water management and identifies necessary research that could serve as a baseline for future crisis decision making to strengthen national and international initiatives on water resource protection.","10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120901","0301-4797 and 1095-8630","","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","","","0301-4797 and 1095-8630",""

This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia.

As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning's key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire.

Synthesis from studies conducted in boreal forests of Canada and Fennoscandia indicates a DEI of similar to 50 meters for residual old-growth forests located along recently (<= 20 years) cutover areas. Based on the comparison of two contrasted scenarios, we demonstrate the strong relationship between residual forest configuration and area under edge influence. For a similar area of residual old-growth forest, linear strips scenario was > 2.5 times more affected by edge compared to agglomerated scenario. We thus recommend considering various types of dispersion strategies that result in large forest residual stands interconnected with remnants > 100 m wide in order to reduce edge influence on the remnant old-growth stands, to mimic forest fire patterns, and to conserve associated biodiversity.

While disaster risk management (DRM) is a serious global challenge, governments, stakeholders, and practitioners among many other actors seek advanced solutions to reduce disaster-related costs. Recently, Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud platform used for planetary-scale geospatial analysis using big-data, has gained popularity due to its applications in various fields. While the availability of free satellite data has facilitated long-term spatial-temporal trends and patterns identification, cloud computing emerged as a reputable tool in geo-big data analyses. Yet nearly after similar to 15 years of its launch, the impact of such cloud-computing platform on DRM (risk assessment, monitoring, and planning) has not been carefully explored. Hence, a systematic review regarding the current state and trends in GEE applications to DRM is needed, which could provide the community with the bigger picture of the subject matter. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the advancement in DRM with GEE being the primary platform used. For this, 547 peer-reviewed studies published in 208 different journals during 2010-2022 were assessed. The current spectrum of GEE applications is dominated by floods, drought, and wildfires. For data type, most of the studies used optical data (Landsat and Sentinel-2). In terms of geographical distribution, China, USA, and India dominate with highest articles published. Within this research domain, three emerging research themes (floods, forest fire, and classification) are observed. Our findings signify the emergence of GEE applications in DRM, which will continue making substantive progress on DRM-related multi-scale challenges.","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.104056","2212-4209","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","","","2212-4209",""

The time needed for hydrologic function to return to pre-fire conditions is critical information for post-fire land and water management decisions. This is particularly true in Mediterranean climates, where water is scarce and in high demand, and the severity and area burned by wildfires are increasing. In part, uncertainty about hydrologic recovery is due to lack of a consistent definition or interpretation of what constitutes ""recovery."" Here, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from Mediterranean climates with at least three years of post-fire hydrologic data with the objectives of (a) assessing the recovery period, (b) identifying a definition of post-fire hydrologic recovery, (c) demonstrating a simple analytical approach to aid in assessment of recovery, and (d) outlining research needs and opportunities to better quantify post-fire recovery. We assessed the hydrologic effects reported in 38 sites that were monitored for 3-20 years. Eighteen sites were considered recovered within seven years; however, the recovery time was inconsistent across sites and was not related to location, response variable, or study design. The likelihood of recovery within the study period also decreased with increasing proportion of the watershed area burned. Importantly, we have also proposed a standardized definition and an approach to quantifying hydrologic recovery that may facilitate cross-study comparisons and a deeper understanding of recovery. Specifically, we propose hydrologic recovery has occurred when a specific post-fire hydrologic function or condition of interest returns to the 95% confidence interval of the pre-fire condition. In support of this definition, we have demonstrated applying this simple approach to assess recovery and presented future research topics to improve our understanding of long-term post-fire catchment responses. In addition to the need for more studies that quantify hydrologic responses farther into the post-fire period, understanding post-fire changes in soil structural and hydraulic properties through time will improve our mechanistic understanding of post-fire hydrologic responses and recovery.","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126772","0022-1694 and 1879-2707","","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","","","0022-1694 and 1879-2707",""

It is also important to know the fire risk mitigation measures available to select the most appropriate for each specific context. In this systematic review, definitions of the WUI were investigated and physical mitigation measures for reducing the risk of fire were examined from a land management perspective. The PRISMA 2020 Statement was applied to records published until 31 December 2022 and retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and other research engines. A total of 162 publications from scientific journals and the grey literature were scrutinised and selected for analysis. Only publications providing an original definition of the WUI or proposing physical measures to reduce fire risk at the interface were retained, while those relating to emergency management and social perception were not considered. The risk of bias was reduced by internal cross-assessment by the research team. Definitions of the WUI (n = 40 publications) changed according to the research objective, varying broadly in identification of the anthropogenic and the wildland components of the interface. Terminology varied according to the definition, and the term wildland-human interface (WHI) was found to be more comprehensive than WUI. Methodological definitions of the interface ranged from using aggregated data through to identification of the buildings at risk in the interface with considerable precision. Five categories of physical fire risk mitigation measures (n = 128 publications) were identified: clearance distances, landscaping, wildland fuel management, land planning, and buildings design and materials. The most effective measures were those applied at early stages of urban development, and maintenance of assets and vegetation is crucial for preparedness. This review represents an analysis of scientific evidence on which land managers can base their actions to reduce the fire hazard risk in the WUI. The number of studies investigating the WUI is considerable, but experimental studies and quantitative results are scarce, and better communication and coordination among research groups and land management agencies is advisable.

This problem is tackled using a meta-analytical approach: (1) published estimates of charcoal source area are compiled to assess all available data and constraints, (2) the limitations and implications of these source area estimates are discussed, and (3) the parameter space of the relationship between charcoal size and dispersal distance is modelled using the published estimates as constraints and with the goal of estimating the functional charcoal source area (FCSA), or the globally applicable source area necessary to facilitate spatially-explicit fire history reconstructions and data-model comparisons. Source area estimates exist in numerous forms and flavors including direct assessments of source area (both relevant (RSAC) and potential charcoal source area (PCSA)) as well as indirect and/or opportunistic observations of dispersal distance. These estimates span several orders of magnitude and do not exhibit size dependent dispersal which may be due to differences in the flavor of source area constrained by each study, limitations of the inferences by the observed fire history at each site in time and space, the physical inability of size class differences examined in paleofire research (e.g. micron scale), to result in observable size-dependence of dispersal, or the effects of other unconstrained influences affecting dispersal and source area. The model results show the FCSA of all size fractions is limited to 50 km. This estimate of the FCSA enables spatially explicit paleofire reconstructions and climate model comparisons.

However, species dominance shifts from conifers to short-lived deciduous trees, which may negatively impact flora, fauna, and ecosystem services dependent on coniferous forests. These results were primarily driven by studies from North America, highlighting the need for more research that directly measures post-fire forest recovery in other high-latitude regions.ContextAs the size and frequency of wildfires increase across many regions, high-latitude forests may be at particular risk for decreases in regeneration and state shifts post-fire.AimsThrough this systematic review, we sought to determine the general relationship between post-fire tree regeneration densities and latitude in forests above 40 degrees N/S. We expected regeneration densities post-fire would decrease with increasing latitude, and that forest regeneration would be negatively impacted by high burn severities, forest management, harsh site conditions, and unprotected microsites. We also anticipated that light-demanding species with adaptations to fire would replace shade-tolerant species that lack such adaptations post-fire.MethodsWe conducted a literature search that returned over 4500 articles. We selected those that directly measured post-fire regeneration at or above 40 degrees N/S and retained 93 articles for analysis. Fire characteristics, pre- and post-fire tree species compositions and regeneration densities, and regeneration predictors were then extracted from the retained articles. We fit linear mixed models to post-fire regeneration density with latitude and species traits as explanatory variables and also explored the significance and magnitude of predictors that informed post-fire tree species response.ResultsContrary to our expectations, post-fire regeneration increased significantly with latitude. High burn severities and unprotected microsites had negative impacts on post-fire regeneration; higher elevations and more prolific pre- or post-fire reproduction were positively correlated with post-fire regeneration, while management of any type did not have an impact.ConclusionAlthough forests are regenerating after wildfires at the most extreme latitudes included in this study (above 55 degrees N), regeneration is often limited to only a handful of genera: aspen (Populus) and birch (Betula), for example. Regeneration was less abundant at the lower range of our study area. Certain lower latitude forests that occupy marginal habitats are under increasing stress from drier, warmer conditions that are exacerbated by wildfires. Results were largely driven by studies from Canada and the USA and may not be applicable to all high-latitude forests.","10.1186/s13595-023-01213-8","1286-4560 and 1297-966X","","ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE","1","","1286-4560 and 1297-966X",""

Soil erosion mitigation treatments have been widely applied after wildfires but assessment of their effectiveness has been limited to local and regional-scale studies, whose conclusions may depend heavily on site-specific conditions. To overcome this limitation, a meta-analysis approach was applied to investigations of post-wildfire soil erosion mitigation treatments published in peer-reviewed journals. A meta-analysis database was compiled that consisted of 53 and 222 pairs of treated/untreated observations on post-fire runoff and erosion, respectively, extracted from 34 publications indexed in Scopus. The overall effectiveness of mitigation treatments, expressed as the quantitative metric 'effect size', was determined for both the runoff and erosion observations, and further analyzed for four different types of treatments (cover-based, barriers, seeding, and chemical treatments). The erosion observations involving cover-based treatments were analyzed for differences in effectiveness between 3 different types of mulch materials (straw, wood-based, and hydromulch) as well as between different application rates of straw and wood materials. Finally, the erosion observations were also analyzed for the overall effectiveness of post-fire year, burn severity, rainfall amount and erosivity, and ground cover. The meta-analysis results show that all four types of treatments significantly reduced post-fire soil erosion, but that only the cover and barrier treatments significantly reduced post-fire runoff. From the three different cover treatments, straw and wood mulches were significantly more effective in mitigating erosion than hydromulch. In addition, the effectiveness of both straw and wood mulches depended on their application rates. Straw mulching was less effective at rates below than above 200 g m- 2, while mulching with wood materials at high rates (1300 to 1750 g m-2) produced more variable outcomes than lower rates. Results also suggest that the overall effectiveness of the treatments was greatest shortly after fire, in severely burned sites, providing or promoting the development of ground cover over 70%, and that it increased with increasing rainfall erosivity. It can be concluded that, in overall terms, the application of the studied post-fire erosion mitigation treatments represented a better choice than doing nothing, especially in sites where erosion is high. However, the metaanalysis highlights under-representation of studies on this topic outside of the USA, Spain and Portugal. It was also observed that most of the studies were conducted at hillslope scale and tested mulching (namely straw, wood and hydromulch) and/or barriers, while larger scales and other treatments were scarcely addressed. Further efforts need to be made in testing, from field and modeling studies, combinations of existing and/or emerging erosion mitigation treatments to ensure that the most adequate measures are applied after fires.","10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103611","0012-8252 and 1872-6828","","EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","","","0012-8252 and 1872-6828",""

Wildland fires are increasing in frequency and magnitude, possibly owing to climate change. In addition, fire is applied as a tool in agroecosystem management. However, several detrimental effects on soil properties, particularly on soil aggregate stability, might occur. A general explanation is that ""the effects of fire on soil aggregate stability in soil with high clay content, calcium carbonate, and Fe and Al oxides as the principal cementing substances cause gradual improvement in aggregate stability, following fire-heating severity."" In short, the higher the fire severity, the higher is the aggregate stability. A meta-analysis was conducted for assessing the laboratory and field studies to verify this concept. The Scopus (R) platform was used to search for the literature related to ""soil aggregate stability"" AND fire OR heating AND clay OR ""clayey soil."" A total of 10 studies were selected with 16 soil types, 244 burned or heated samples, and 160 control samples. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Metaanalysis was delineated according to the following assumptions: a) field and laboratory studies were tested as two independent subgroups, and a pooled effect was subsequently calculated; b) a random-effects model was used; c) mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for continuous variables. Laboratory and field measurements showed dissimilar effects on soil aggregate stability and evidenced positive effects in the laboratory experiments compared with those in the field. Aggregate stability measured in the laboratory increased by 2.80% after heating. Fire effects measured in the field did not show a significant increase in soil aggregate stability (-0.16%). The overall effects of combined subgroups showed an aggregate stability improvement of 1.49% (confidence intervals 0.80% to 2.17%). However, the weight of the results from the laboratory studies played an important role in the overall effect. The soil clay content was found to be inversely associated with aggregate stability, i.e., the lower the clay content the higher the aggregate stability in soil subjected to fire heating. In conclusion, the aggregate stability of clayey soils rich in Al and Fe oxides does not necessarily improves following fire heating.","10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103802","0012-8252 and 1872-6828","","EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","","","0012-8252 and 1872-6828",""

We conducted a systematic literature review of empirically based studies that tested the influence of landscape-level fuel treatments on subsequent wildfires in North America over the past 30 years to evaluate how treatment type and configuration affect subsequent wildfire behavior or enable more effective wildfire response. Results We identified 2240 papers, but only 26 met our inclusion criteria. Wildfire sizes ranged from 96 to 186,874 ha and total treated area ranged from 8 to 53,423 ha. Total treated area within a wildfire perimeter was highly correlated with wildfire area (r = 0.89, n = 93 wildfires), and the average proportion of wildfire area that was treated was 22%. All studies demonstrated wildfire behavior changes within treatment boundaries (i.e., site-level effect), but only 12 studies provided evidence that treatments influence wildfires outside of treatment boundaries (i.e., landscape-level effect). These 12 landscape-level papers showed effects on fire severity, fire progression, and fire extent, but were dissimilar in design and analysis approaches, constraining the ability to generalize about the type and configuration of fuel treatments to maximize effectiveness. Conclusions It is clear that the state of knowledge based on empirical evidence is at its infancy. This is likely because of the vast challenges associated with designing and implementing sampling designs that account for combinations of spatial and temporal configurations prior to wildfire occurrence. We also suspect part of the reason empirical evidence is lacking is because the distinction between site-level and landscape-level effects is not well recognized in the literature. All papers used the term landscape, but rarely defined the landscape, and some specified identifying landscape-level effects that were truly site-level effects. Future research needs to develop innovative ways to interpret the role of fuel treatments at the landscape level to provide insight on strategic designs and approaches to maximize fuel treatment effectiveness.","10.1186/s42408-022-00146-3","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","1","","1933-9747",""

Understanding how soil pools of these two elements change in response to disturbance and management is critical to maintaining ecosystem services such as forest productivity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water resource protection. Fire is one of the principal disturbances acting on forest soil C and N storage and is also the subject of enormous management efforts. In the present article, we use meta-analysis to quantify fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage. Across a combined total of 468 soil C and N response ratios from 57 publications (concentrations and pool sizes), fire had significant overall effects on soil C (-26%) and soil N (-22%). The impacts of fire on forest floors were significantly different from its effects on mineral soils. Fires reduced forest floor C and N storage (pool sizes only) by an average of 59% and 50%, respectively, but the concentrations of these two elements did not change. Prescribed fires caused smaller reductions in forest floor C and N storage (-46% and -35%) than wildfires (-67% and -69%), and the presence of hardwoods also mitigated fire impacts. Burned forest floors recovered their C and N pools in an average of 128 and 103 years, respectively. Among mineral soils, there were no significant changes in C or N storage, but C and N concentrations declined significantly (-11% and -12%, respectively). Mineral soil C and N concentrations were significantly affected by fire type, with no change following prescribed burns, but significant reductions in response to wildfires. Geographic variation in fire effects on mineral soil C and N storage underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and the role of fire type in mediating C and N shifts (especially in the forest floor) indicates that averting wildfires through prescribed burning is desirable from a soils perspective.","10.1890/10-0660.1","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","4","1189","1051-0761 and 1939-5582",""

The objective of this work was to review the existing literature on the role of soil burn severity on post-fire runoff and erosion ratios. To this end, a meta-analysis was carried out of the runoff and inter-rill erosion data from field rainfall simulation experiments (RSE's) that compared burnt and unburnt conditions. In this study, 109 individual observations were analysed that covered a wide geographical range, various types of land cover (forest, shrubland, and grassland) and two types of fire types (wildfire and prescribed fire). The effect size of the post-fire runoff and erosion response was determined for four key factors: (i) soil burn severity; (ii) time-since-fire; (iii) rainfall intensity; and (iv) bare soil cover. Statistical meta-analysis showed that fire occurrence had a significant effect on the hydrological and erosive response. However, this effect was only significantly higher with increasing soil burn severity for inter-rill erosion, and not for runoff. This study furthermore highlighted the incoherencies between existing burn severity classifications, and proposed an unambiguous classification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The meta analysis showed that forest harvesting, on average, had little or no effect on soil C and N. Significant effects of harvest type and species were noted, with sawlog harvesting causing increases (+18%) in soil C and N and whole-tree harvesting causing decreases (-6%). The positive effect of sawlog harvesting appeared to be restricted to coniferous species.

Significant differences among fire treatments were found, with the counterintuitive result of lower soil C following prescribed fire and higher soil C following wildfire.

We hypothesized that microbial biomass as a whole, and fungal biomass specifically, would be altered following fires. Across all studies, fire reduced microbial abundance by an average of 33.2% and fungal abundance by an average of 47.6%. However, microbial responses to fire differed significantly among biomes and fire types. For example, microbial biomass declined following fires in boreal and temperate forests but not following grasslands fires. In addition, wildfires lead to a greater reduction in microbial biomass than prescribed burns. These differences are likely attributable to differences in fire severity among biomes and fire types. Changes in microbial abundance were significantly correlated with changes in soil CO2 emissions. Altogether, these results suggest that fires may significantly decrease microbial abundance, with corresponding consequences for soil CO2 emissions.","10.1007/s10533-011-9633-8","0168-2563 and 1573-515X","","BIOGEOCHEMISTRY","1-3","49","0168-2563 and 1573-515X",""

We conducted this, the third in a series of ecoregional SOC assessments, for the Pacific Northwest, which comprises similar to 8% of the land area but similar to 12% of the U.S. forest sector C sink. At the ecoregional level, our analysis indicated that fundamental patterns of vegetation, climate, and topography are far more important controls on SOC stocks than land use history, disturbance, or management. However, the same patterns suggested that increased warming, drying, wildland fire, and forest regeneration failure pose significant risks to SOC stocks across the region. Detailed meta-analysis results indicated that wildfires diminished SOC stocks throughout the soil profile, while prescribed fire only influenced surface organic materials and harvesting had no significant overall impact on SOC. Independent observational data corroborated the negative influence of fire on SOC derived from meta-analysis, suggested that harvest impacts may vary subregionally with climate or vegetation, and revealed that forests with agricultural uses (e.g., grazing) or legacies (e.g., cultivation) had smaller SOC stocks. We also quantified effects of a range of common forest management practices having either positive (organic amendments, nitrogen [N]-fixing vegetation establishment, inorganic N fertilization) or no overall effects on SOC (other inorganic fertilizers, urea fertilization, competition suppression through herbicides). In order to maximize the management applications of our results, we qualified them with ratings of confidence based on degree of support across approaches.

(2) How do the effects vary with treatment type, treatment age, and forest type? (3) How does fire weather moderate the effects of treatments? We found overwhelming evidence that mechanical thinning with prescribed burning, mechanical thinning with pile burning, and prescribed burning only are effective at reducing subsequent wildfire severity, resulting in reductions in severity between 62% and 72% relative to untreated areas. In comparison, thinning only was less effective - underscoring the importance of treating surface fuels when mitigating wildfire severity is the management goal. The efficacy of these treatments did not vary among forest types assessed in this study and was high across a range of fire weather conditions. Prior wildfire had more complex impacts on subsequent wildfire severity, which varied with forest type and initial wildfire severity. Across treatment types, we found that effectiveness of treatments declined over time, with the mean reduction in wildfire severity decreasing more than twofold when wildfire occurred greater than 10 years after initial treatment. Our meta-analysis provides up-to-date information on the extent to which active forest management reduces wildfire severity and facilitates better outcomes for people and forests during future wildfire events.","10.1016/j.foreco.2024.121885","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 %, but had no effect on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire significantly decreased ant diversity in forests-especially in tropical forests-whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not. Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests, wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast, fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire, and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature of fire effects on ants.","10.1007/s10531-016-1234-3","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","1","177","0960-3115 and 1572-9710",""

The literature suggests fire and mechanical treatments proved more variable in their effects on understory vegetation as compared to their effects on stand structure. The growing body of work comparing fire and thinning effects on understory vegetation offers an opportunity to increase the generality of conclusions through meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine if there were consistent responses of understory vegetation to these treatments in North American forests that historically experienced frequent surface fire regimes (<20 years fire return interval, FRI). Means and standard errors were extracted from 32 papers containing data on the response of four understory functional groups (herbaceous, shrub, non-native, and total) to thinning and burning treatments to calculate effect sizes. Lack of replication and inconsistent reporting of results hindered our ability to include many studies in this analysis. For each response variable (species richness and percent cover), we compared three treatment pairs: burn vs control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood to account for variation by site. The most consistent effect of the treatments was the increase in non-native species following mechanical thinning and reduction in shrub cover following a burn. These differences suggest the two treatments may not be surrogates in the short-term (less than 5 years). Increase of non-native species due to disturbance is well established but it is not clear if burning and thinning consistently have differential impacts. Response of non-native plants to disturbance is likely a complex function of a variety of site and landscape factors that cannot be evaluated by the current literature. We conclude that prescribed fire and thinning treatments can be used successfully to restore understory species richness and cover, but they can create different conditions and these potentially different outcomes need to be considered in the planning of a fuels reduction treatment. We discuss management options to reduce negative effects of the treatments and we suggest managers use current decision-making frameworks prior to designing an intervention.

This systematic review aimed to identify the current definitions and measurements of psychological preparedness to gain a better understanding of its meaning and the quality of research measures. An electronic literature search was conducted using six databases (ScienceDirect, ProQuest, JSTOR, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and 20 emergency services and fire agency websites.

Of the seven measurement tools identified, only two were judged to be psychometrically sound, however none had been widely used. The review suggests that psychological preparedness is still an under-researched area, and detailed inspection of the research would suggest there is still a long way to go to eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the psychological preparedness construct. This ambiguity is centred in the lack of construct clarity and the lack of measurement theory and psychometric assessment in the development of instruments.","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101480","2212-4209","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","","","2212-4209",""

LocationWorld-wide. MethodsWe calculated indices of the difference in species richness (alpha diversity) and species composition (beta diversity) between burnt and unburnt habitats from studies reporting the species richness and assemblage composition of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. We used a hierarchical approach to investigate the effects of fire on alpha and beta diversity. We tested first for the main effect of fire before investigating the potential influence of fire type (wildfire/prescribed burn), taxon, ecoregion and geographical location (hemisphere/continent). ResultsOne hundred and four studies were evaluated: 56 studies on birds, 26 on mammals, 17 on reptiles and 5 on amphibians. The studies fell into 14 ecoregions, with the three most common being temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, temperate grasslands and savannas and shrublands, and temperate coniferous forest. The effect of fire on species richness and community assemblage composition was strongly influenced by fire type. Prescribed burns significantly increased alpha diversity, whereas wildfires had no overall effect. However, wildfire increased the alpha diversity of temperate coniferous birds in North America. The effects of fire on alpha diversity were stronger in the Northern than the Southern Hemisphere. Turnover in species assemblages (beta diversity) was influenced primarily by fire type. Species assemblages in burnt and unburnt habitats were more similar after prescribed burns and generated lower levels of beta diversity than did wildfires. Main conclusionsThe divergent effects of wildfires and prescribed fires on the alpha and beta diversity of vertebrates and the disparate responses of vertebrate diversity to fires in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere suggest that there is no general response of vertebrate diversity to fire. Our results provide little support for the patch mosaic burn theory or the intermediate disturbance hypothesis to predict post-fire responses of vertebrate diversity.","10.1111/geb.12195","1466-822X and 1466-8238","","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","10","1146","1466-822X and 1466-8238",""

Understanding fire effects on soil seed banks is critical in the context of altered global fire regimes. Through a systematic and quantitative review of the literature, we provide the first global assessment of how soil seed banks respond to fire based on 539 paired comparisons. The overall effects of fire on soil seed bank richness (i.e., the species richness in soil seed bank) and abundance were negative and neutral, respectively. Wildfires and high-intensity fires led to greater decreases in the richness and abundance of the seed bank than prescribed burns and low-severity fires, respectively. As an important fire cue, the presence of simulated smoke increased seed bank richness and abundance, but simulated heat shock had no effect on both two metrics, in contrast to the findings of previous empirical studies. Strong, positive fire effects on soil seed bank abundance were found in Mediterranean ecosystems, but fire effects were negative for forest ecosystems, especially tropical forests. Both the richness and abundance of tree species in the seed bank decreased after fire. Burning only had a negative effect on the soil seed bank in habitats with no previous fire history or a short fire history. As time elapsed post-fire, the soil seed bank abundance also increased. Overall, fire tended to decrease soil seed bank richness globally, and this was especially the case for high-severity fires in non-fire-prone ecosystems. Our findings enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability in fire effects on soil seed banks, and highlight the importance of monitoring post-fire seed bank composition across ecosystems, with crucial implications for vegetation regeneration and ecosystem recovery.","10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02132","2351-9894","","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION","","","2351-9894",""

Quality of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results: Eleven studies were included; eight assessed the impact of maternal exposure to air pollution exacerbation events, such as wildfires, oil well fires and volcanic eruptions, and three assessed the impact of improvement events, such as the 2018 Beijing Olympics and closure of industrial activities, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Studies were highly heterogenous in methodology. Six studies found a significant association between acute changes in air quality and markers of fetal growth restriction, while two did not. Three studies found an adverse association between acute changes in air quality and markers of gestational maturity, and one did not. Conclusion: Overall, there is some evidence that maternal exposure to acute changes in air quality of short-to medium-term duration increases the risk of fetal growth restriction and preterm birth.

After several years from the time of the fire, the negative effects of fire on Rs diminished and then recovered to a state not significantly different from unburnt sites; Rh exhibited a similar but decayed temporal response. Similarly, the negative effects on Ra disappeared after 3 years following the latest fire. The magnitude of the effect on Rs was strongly associated with soil temperature, cation exchange capacity, total nitrogen (N) content and N-acquiring enzyme activity.

These documented and projected impacts in the region can also propagate across borders, creating risks and opportunities requiring adaptation responses well beyond the Arctic. By undertaking a systematic literature review that uses a conceptual framework for cross-border climate change impacts, we demonstrate how local impacts of the type described above, which are often analyzed separately in the literature, may initiate knock-on effects that can be transmitted and transformed across borders. We illustrate examples of six categories of cross-border risks resulting from this impact transmission and potentially requiring adaptation.

We examine potential adaptation options for responding to such cross-border risks that are of relevance for Europe. The systemic approach taken in this paper promotes improved understanding of trade-offs between potential benefits and risks, assists priority-setting for targeting adaptation interventions, and can account for the important role of non-climatic drivers in amplifying or dampening the cross-border risks of climate change impacts in the Arctic.

In S. undata, a decline in survival in the 'long-term' cannot account for the drop in density observed the first spring after fire. We suggest that a decrease in recruitment rate and an increase in the proportion of non-breeders immediately after the fire may contribute more strongly to the decline in the breeding population.

Using classification and regression tree analysis, we identified those attributes that are strong predictors of carbon payback period (e.g. the time required by the forest to recover through sequestration the carbon dioxide from biomass combusted for energy). The inclusion of wildfire dynamics proved to be the most influential in determining carbon payback period length compared to other factors such as feedstock type, baseline choice, and the incorporation of leakage calculations. Additionally, we demonstrate that evaluation criteria consistency is required to facilitate equitable comparison between projects. For carbon payback period calculations to provide operational insights to decision makers, future research should focus on creating common accounting principles for the most influential factors including temporal scale, natural disturbances, system boundaries, GHG emission metrics, and baselines.","10.1111/gcbb.12245","1757-1693 and 1757-1707","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY","2","281","1757-1693 and 1757-1707",""

A better understanding of how soil communities respond to Amazonian deforestation is crucially needed to inform policy interventions that effectively protect biodiversity and the essential ecosystem services it provides. We assessed the impact of deforestation and ecosystem conversion to arable land on Amazonian soil biodiversity through a meta-analysis. We analyzed 274 pairwise comparisons of soil biodiversity in Amazonian primary forests and sites under different stages of deforestation and land-use conversion: disturbed (wildfire and selective logging) and slash-and-burnt forests, pastures, and cropping systems. Overall, 60% and 51% of responses of soil macrofauna and microbial community attributes (i.e., abundance, biomass, richness, and diversity indexes) to deforestation were negative, respectively. We found few studies on mesofauna (e.g., microarthropods) and microfauna (e.g., protozoa and nematodes), so those groups could not be analyzed. Macrofauna abundance and biomass were more vulnerable to the displacement of forests by pastures than by agricultural fields, whereas microbes showed the opposite pattern. Effects of Amazonian deforestation on macrofauna were more detrimental at sites with mean annual precipitation >1900 mm, and higher losses of microbes occurred in highly acidic soils (pH < 4.5). Limited geographic coverage, omission of meso- and microfauna, and low taxonomic resolution were main factors impairing generalizations from the data set. Few studies assessed the impacts of within-forest disturbance (wildfires and selective logging) on soil species in Amazonia, where logging operations rapidly expand across public lands and more frequent severe dry seasons are increasing the prevalence of wildfires.","10.1111/cobi.13234","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","3","590","0888-8892 and 1523-1739",""

Although soil respiration (SR) is important in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations, a general pattern of the response of SR to fire in terrestrial ecosystems remains unclear. In this study, a meta-analysis of 91 studies on fires across 116 global sites was conducted to investigate the effects of fire on SR and its components. The results revealed that the responses of SR and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to fire were dependent on fire severity (low-, moderate-, and high-severity) and types (wildfire and prescribed fire). Specifically, the high- and low-severity fires reduced SR and HR, whereas moderate-severity fires had negligible effects on these parameters. On average, wildfires significantly decreased SR and HR by 13.9% and 18.6%, respectively, across all ecosystems, while prescribed fire reduced SR by 8.4% but did not change HR. In addition, the responses of SR and HR varied with the ecosystem types. Fire decreased SR in all three types of forests (boreal forests: -14.8%, temperate forests: -13.8%, and tropical forests: -28.9%), whereas decreased HR only in boreal and temperate forests (-23.8% and 20.7%, respectively) but not in tropical forests. Moreover, SR decreased directly followed by an increase, whereas HR declined with time after low- and high-severity fires. At a global scale, the responses of SR and HR to fire largely resulted from the changes in soil organic C, dissolved C, microbial biomass C, and belowground biomass, as indicated by the correlation analysis. In addition, the response of SR to fire was negatively affected by the mean annual precipitation in the forests. Overall, our study revealed the mechanisms driving the effects of fire and provided a framework for understanding soil C emissions under intensified fire regimes.","10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109496","0168-1923 and 1873-2240","","AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY","","","0168-1923 and 1873-2240",""

To successfully emulate natural disturbances, managers must first have an understanding of the complex interactions that occur to the biophysical and chemical attributes of an ecosystem for both the natural and the ""emulating"" disturbance. The management of riparian ecosystems is an important issue faced by managers since the type of harvesting treatment can have a significant influence on the aquatic component. The removal or retention of riparian forests can have a direct influence on water quality and quantity, particularly on the smaller systems that are found at the headwaters of catchments, but do these treatments invoke a similar response as wildfire? To determine if emulation occurs, the affects of forest harvesting treatments and wildfire on temperature, water chemistry, summer stream flow, and sedimentation in headwater systems were compared using a meta-analysis. A statistically significant difference was found for temperature response between partial/selective harvesting and wildfire, but not after clear-cut harvesting. Water chemistry showed statistically significant differences for I I out of 14 tested attributes, with dissolved organic carbon exhibiting the most marked difference. A significant difference was identified between clear-cut harvesting and wildfire for summer stream flow but not between wildfire and partial/ selective harvest systems. Forest harvesting operations were found to emulate sedimentation through forest roads but not harvest treatment. Partial/selective harvest systems may offer the greatest emulation congruency versus clear-cut harvest systems in terms of overall headwater response and recovery. Partial/selective harvest systems combined with prescribed burning may provide managers with the best solution when attempting to emulate wildfire in headwater systems and reduce the detrimental impact of perturbation on these systems.

However, to date, much of the focus of the research and bushfire community education is on physical preparedness, leaving much confusion about what it means to be psychologically prepared. This is in part due to the lack of a wellaccepted operational definition and measure of bushfire psychological preparedness. Currently, there is one measure of psychological preparedness, based on stress inoculation theory, which shows relatively strong psychometric properties. However, findings from our systematic review suggest an alternative theoretical approach to defining psychological preparedness i.e. cognitive appraisal and psychological resources that enable people to manage their emotional responses to stress. To the authors' knowledge, no measure has been developed that operationally defines psychological preparedness using the latter theoretical approach. To fill this gap, and to extend the research on psychological preparedness for natural hazards, we have developed the Bushfire Psychological Preparedness Scale (BPPS). The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary analysis of the psychometric properties of the BPPS. Following rigorous testing, the resulting scale was a 33-item self-report tool, which meets the most important criteria for satisfactory reliability and validity. In its current format, this tool can be used by anyone with psychological knowledge seeking to understand the psychological preparedness of an individual for a bushfire. With adjustments and consultation with fire agencies, a user-friendly version can be developed for public use.","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101530","2212-4209","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","","","2212-4209",""

Due to invasion of many ecosystems by exotic species, a concern of land managers is whether wildfire and prescribed fire alter plant communities in favour of exotics. We assessed the global literature describing community-level responses of native and exotic species groups to wildfire and prescribed fire and characterized the geographic and temporal scope of the data to inform research needs. LocationPredominantly the United States of America and Australia. MethodsWe used meta-analysis to (1) test whether native and exotic species composition (richness or diversity) and performance (cover, density and biomass) differ in response to wildfire and prescribed fire, and (2) assess how the composition and performance of these species groups vary with time elapsed since fire and habitat types. ResultsMost community-level research on how native and exotic species respond to fire has been conducted in the US and Australia, typically over short time scales, and with a focus on temperate forest and grassland ecosystems. Prescribed fire benefited native composition over short time scales (<1yr) but, on average, had no effect on native performance, nor on exotic composition or performance. In contrast, wildfire consistently enhanced exotic composition and performance over all time scales, while having no effect on native species composition and significantly reducing native performance. Additionally, responses varied by habitat: native species groups responded positively to prescribed fire in heathlands and to a lesser extent in temperate grasslands, while responding negatively to wildfire in arid shrublands and heathlands, and to a more modest degree in tropical savannas. Exotic species groups responded positively to wildfire in arid shrublands, temperate forests and heathlands. ConclusionsThis quantitative assessment of the literature revealed strong evidence for a positive response of exotics to wildfire, coupled with a striking near-absence of negative responses. The assessment additionally suggests that while prescribed fire does benefit native composition, on average, it does not appear to greatly facilitate native performance; however site-specific variation in how communities responded to fire was pronounced, underscoring the importance of local assessments in determining mechanistic drivers and management policy.","10.1111/jvs.12212","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE","1","102","1100-9233 and 1654-1103",""

We synthesized data on forest vegetation at edges of boreal forests and compared edge influence among edge types (fire, cut, lake/wetland; old vs. young), forest types (broadleaf vs. coniferous) and geographic regions. Our objectives were to quantify vegetation responses at edges of all types and to compare the strength and extent of edge influence among different types of edges and forests. Research was conducted using the same general sampling design in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in Sweden and Finland. We conducted a meta-analysis for a variety of response variables including forest structure, deadwood abundance, regeneration, understorey abundance and diversity, and non-vascular plant cover. We also determined the magnitude and distance of edge influence (DEI) using randomization tests. Some edge responses (lower tree basal area, tree canopy and bryophyte cover; more logs; higher regeneration) were significant overall across studies. Edge influence on ground vegetation in boreal forests was generally weak, not very extensive (DEI usually <20m) and decreased with time. We found more extensive edge influence at natural edges, at younger edges and in broadleaf forests. The comparison among regions revealed weaker edge influence in Fennoscandian forests.Synthesis. Edges created by forest harvesting do not appear to have as strong, extensive or persistent influence on vegetation in boreal as in tropical or temperate forested ecosystems. We attribute this apparent resistance to shorter canopy heights, inherent heterogeneity in boreal forests and their adaptation to frequent natural disturbance. Nevertheless, notable differences between forest structure responses to natural (fire) and anthropogenic (cut) edges raise concerns about biodiversity implications of extensive creation of anthropogenic edges. By highlighting universal responses to edge influence in boreal forests that are significant irrespective of edge or forest type, and those which vary by edge type, we provide a context for the conservation of boreal forests.","10.1111/1365-2745.12398","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","3","550","0022-0477 and 1365-2745",""

We developed a demographic framework for classifying mechanisms by which fire regimes cause population decline and applied the framework in a systematic review to identify fire characteristics and interacting threats associated with population declines in Australian threatened land mammals (n = 99). Inappropriate fire regimes threaten 88% of Australian threatened land mammals. Our review indicates that intense, large, and frequent fires are the primary cause of fire-related population declines, particularly through their influence on survival rates. However, several species are threatened by a lack of fire, and there is considerable uncertainty in the evidence base for fire-related declines. Climate change and predation are documented or predicted to interact with fire to exacerbate mammalian declines. This demographic framework will help target conservation actions globally and will be enhanced by empirical studies of animal survival, movement, and reproduction.","10.1111/conl.12905","1755-263X","","CONSERVATION LETTERS","5","","1755-263X",""

Understanding drivers of boreal forest dynamics supports adaptation strategies in the context of climate change. Aims. We aimed to understand how burn rates varied since the early 1700s in North American boreal forests. Methods. We used 16 fire-history study sites distributed across such forests and investigated variation in burn rates for the historical period spanning 1700-1990. These were benchmarked against recent burn rates estimated for the modern period spanning 1980-2020 using various data sources. Key results. Burn rates during the historical period for most sites showed a declining trend, particularly during the early to mid 1900s. Compared to the historical period, the modern period showed less variable and lower burn rates across sites. Mean burn rates during the modern period presented divergent trends among eastern versus northwestern sites, with increasing trends in mean burn rates in most northwestern North American sites. Conclusions.

This work synthesizes 73 K-fs datasets from the literature in the first year following fire at the plot scale (<= 10 m(2)). A meta-analysis using a random effects analysis showed significant differences between burned and unburned K-fs. The reductions in K-fs after fire, expressed by the ratio of K-fs Burned/K-fs Unburned, were 0.46 (95% confidence interval of 0.31-0.70) combining wildfire and prescribed fire and 0.3 (95% confidence interval of 0.13-0.71) for wildfire. No significant differences for K-fs were observed between wildfire and prescribed fire or moderate and high fire severity. Both K-fs magnitude and variability depended more on measurement method than measurement support area at the plot scale, with methods applying head >= 0.5 cm producing larger estimates of K-fs. It is recommended that post-fire efforts to characterize K-fs for modeling or process-based interpretations use methods that reflect the dominant infiltration processes: tension infiltrometers and simulated rainfall methods when soil matrix flow dominates and ponded head methods when macropore flow is critical.

Despite the crucial role of K-fs in parameterizing numerical hydrologic models to predict the magnitude of postwildfire run-off and erosion, existing quantitative relations to predict K-fs recovery with time since wildfire are lacking. Here, we conduct meta-analyses of 5 datasets from the literature that measure or estimate K-fs with time since wildfire for longer than 3-year duration.

The 2 relations adequately described temporal recovery except for 1 site where macropore flow dominated infiltration and K-fs recovery. This work also suggests that K-fs can have low hydrologic resistance (large postfire changes), and moderate to high hydrologic stability (recovery time relative to disturbance recurrence interval) and resilience (recovery of hydrologic function and provision of ecosystem services).

We conducted an evidence-based review to examine the effectiveness and effects of post-wildfire seeding treatments on soil stabilization, non-native species invasion, and plant community recovery in the western U.S. We reviewed 94 scientific papers and agency monitoring reports identified using a systematic search protocol. As sampling designs have become more rigorous in recent years, evidence that seeding is effective in reducing erosion has decreased. Of highest and high quality studies evaluating soil erosion, 92% (11 of 12) were published since 2000, none of which showed an effective result. Before 2000, the majority of the studies (71%) fell into the lowest quality categories, of which 72% showed seeding to be effective. The majority of studies (20 of 27, 74%) evaluating soil erosion in seeded versus unseeded controls showed that seeding did not reduce erosion relative to unseeded controls. Even when seeding significantly increased vegetative cover, seeded sites rarely supported plant cover levels considered sufficient to stabilize soils within the first and second year post-wildfire. Of the 11 studies evaluating seeding effectiveness for curtailing invasions of non-native plant species, an almost equal percentage found seeding treatments to be either effective (54%, 6 studies) or ineffective (45%, 5 studies). However, the majority of effective and ineffective treatments (83% and 80%, respectively) used non-native species. Sixteen of 26 studies (62%) evaluating seeding effects on plant communities reported that seeding suppressed recovery of native plants, although data on long-term impacts of this reduction are limited. The literature suggests that post-wildfire seeding does little to protect soil in the short-term, has equivocal effect on invasion of non-native species, and can have negative effects on native vegetation recovery, although long-term studies are needed to assess lasting impacts of seeded species.

Traits of the dominant species influence litter flammability directly by determining how individual leaves burn and indirectly through the structure of the litter bed. However, we are yet to determine the relative importance of these different drivers across a range of plant species from different biomes. We undertook a meta-analysis, combining leaf trait, litter structure and flammability data for 106 species from North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The dataset encompassed broad-leaved and coniferous species from seven different experimental studies. Relationships between leaf traits, litter structure and key flammability metrics-sustainability, combustibility and consumability-were analysed using bivariate and piecewise structural equation modelling (SEM). Traits which characterise the three-dimensional nature of the leaf and how much space a leaf occupies showed much stronger associations to litter structure and flammability than other morphological traits. Leaf curl, surface area to volume ratio (SAV) and SLA predominately influence litter flammability indirectly via litter structure with SLA being the only leaf trait which had a negative direct effect on flame duration. Packing ratio and bulk density were influenced by different combinations of leaf traits and, in turn, they aligned with different flammability metrics. Bulk density predicted flame spread rate and flame duration whereas packing ratio predicted consumption. Synthesis. We identified key leaf and litter traits which influence different components of litter bed flammability. Importantly, we show that the effects of these leaf and litter traits are consistent across a wide range of taxa and biomes. Our study represents a significant step towards developing trait-based models for predicting surface wildfire behaviour. Such models will more flexibly accommodate future shifts in the composition of plant species triggered by altered fire regimes and climate change.","10.1111/1365-2745.13561","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","3","1344","0022-0477 and 1365-2745",""

We analyzed snowshoe hare tortuosity, speed of movement, and amount of browse along winter foraging pathways in unburned mature forest and in dense regenerating stands or open areas with sparse regeneration 12-13 years after the Okanagan Mountain Park fire (>25 000 ha near Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada) to determine whether hares change foraging behaviour in relation to cover type. Hares moved the fastest and browsed the least in open habitats. Hares browsed most often in areas where sapling regeneration was dense; their main forage was lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon). No differences were found in pathway tortuosity in relation to cover type (open, regenerating, or mature patches). When hares moved slower along foraging pathways, they also moved slightly more tortuously and ate more. These results suggest that hares prefer post-fire areas with dense tree regeneration.","10.1139/cjz-2018-0222","0008-4301 and 1480-3283","","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY","5","446","0008-4301 and 1480-3283",""

While understory protection harvesting has been implemented for over a decade in Alberta, Canada, there has been no assessment of its use by birds. We surveyed birds in UP and NDH harvest blocks, and the nearby unharvested forest, and evaluated differences in species richness and community composition between the three treatment types. We found NDH had significantly higher species richness than unharvested forests, but did not differ from UP. The three treatments all had significantly different avian community compositions, and NDH showed no convergence with the unharvested forest over 15 years post-harvest. However, UP represented an intermediary between NDH and unharvested forests. When comparing the oldest age class of UP with unharvested forest, we found no significant difference in the bird communities 12 years post-harvest.

The question of how to maximize the effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments at landscape scales is important because treating an entire landscape may be undesirable or unfeasible. We reviewed 86 simulation studies that examined landscape-scale fuel reduction treatment effectiveness for landscapes of the USA or Canada. Each of these studies tested effects of fuel reduction treatments on wildfire through comparisons of landscape scenarios differing by treatment design or other attributes. Results from these studies were summarized to assess what they reveal about factors determining fuel treatment effectiveness at landscape scales.ResultsQualifying studies focused primarily but not exclusively on forested landscapes of the western USA and ranged in size from 200 to 3,400,000 ha. Most studies showed that scenarios with fuel reduction treatments had lower levels of wildfire compared to untreated scenarios. Damaging wildfire types decreased while beneficial wildfire increased as a result of treatments in most cases where these were differentiated. Wildfire outcomes were influenced by five dimensions of treatment design (extent, placement, size, prescription, and timing) and other factors beyond the treatments (weather, climate, fire/fuel attributes, and other management inputs). Studies testing factorial combinations showed that the relative importance of these factors varied across landscapes and contexts.ConclusionsSimulation studies have highlighted general principles of effective fuel treatment design at landscape scales, including the desirability of treating extensive areas with appropriate prescriptions at sufficient frequency to reduce wildfire impacts even under extreme conditions that may be more prevalent in the future. More specific, context-dependent strategies have also been provided, such as a variety of placement schemes prioritizing the protection of different resources. Optimization algorithms were shown to be helpful for determining treatment placement and timing to achieve desired objectives under given constraints. Additional work is needed to expand the geographical scope of these studies, further examine the importance and interactions of driving factors, and assess longer-term effects of fuel reduction treatments under projected climate change.","10.1186/s42408-022-00163-2","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","1","","1933-9747",""

We synthesized information from case studies that documented the influence of fuel treatments on wildfire events. We used a systematic review to identify relevant case studies and extracted information through a series of targeted questions to summarize experiential knowledge of landscape fuel treatment effectiveness. Within a larger literature search, we identified 18 case study reports that included (1) manager assessment of fuel treatment effectiveness during specific wildfire events; (2) fuel treatment effects on fire size, severity, and behavior outside of the treatment boundaries; and (3) the influence of fuel treatments on fire suppression tactics. Results: Seventeen of the 18 case studies occurred in the western United States, and all were primarily focused on forested ecosystems. Surface fire behavior was more commonly observed in areas treated for fuel reduction than in untreated areas, which managers described as evidence of treatment effectiveness. Reduced fire intensity diminished fire effects and supported fire suppression efforts, while offering the potential to use wildfires as a fuel treatment surrogate. Conclusions: Managers considered treatments to be most effective at landscape scales when fuels were reduced in multiple fuel layers (crown, ladder, and surface fuels), across larger portions of the landscape. Treatment effectiveness was improved by strategic placement of treatments adjacent to prior treatments or past wildfires, in alignment with prevailing winds, and adjacent to natural fire breaks (e.g., ridgetops), efforts that effectively expanded the treatment area. Placement in relation to suppression needs to protect infrastructure also can take advantage of continuity with unvegetated land cover (e.g., parking lots, streets). Older treatments were considered less effective due to the regrowth of surface fuels. Treatment effectiveness was limited during periods of extreme fire weather, underscoring the need for treatment designs to incorporate the increasing occurrence of extreme burning conditions. Overall, fuel treatment effectiveness would be improved by the increased use of landscape-scale treatment designs that integrate fuels, topography, prevailing winds, fire or treatment history, and available infrastructure.","10.1186/s42408-022-00159-y","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","1","","1933-9747",""

Conversely, the fire increased soil bulk density (BD; +10.8 %), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N; +46 %), nitrate nitrogen (NO3 --N; +54 %), pH (+4.4 %), and soil temperature (+15.4 %). Our meta-regression analysis showed that the positive effects of fire on soil CH4 and N2O emissions were significantly positively correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), indicating that climate warming will amplify the positive effects of fire disturbance on soil CH4 and N2O emissions. Taken together, since higher future temperatures are likely to prolong the fire season and increase the potential of fires, this could lead to positive feedback between warming, fire events, CH4 and N2O emissions, and future climate change.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174708","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

We used Landsat data to develop maps of canopy cover for each study area, which we then used to quantify annual territory-specific habitat covariates. We modeled the relationships between territory extinction and colonization using predictor variables of habitat, disturbance (logging, fire), climate, and elevation. We found that forests with medium (40-69%) and high (>= 70%) canopy cover were the most important predictors of territory occupancy in all study areas, and that both canopy cover categories were positively correlated with occupancy. We used analysis of deviance to estimate the amount of variation explained by the habitat covariates (primarily medium and high canopy cover) and found that these covariates explained from 35% to 67% of the variation in occupancy. Climatic covariates were not correlated with occupancy dynamics and explained little of the variation in occupancy. We also conducted a post hoc analysis in which we partitioned canopy cover into 10% classes, because our original partitioning into 3 classes may have lacked sufficient resolution to identify canopy cover levels where occupancy changed abruptly. In this post hoc analysis, occupancy declined sharply when territories contained more area with <40% canopy cover, and the amount of 50-59% and 60-69% canopy cover had a more positive association with occupancy than did 40-49% canopy cover. Our results suggest that some fuels treatments intended to reduce fire risk and improve forest resilience could be located within Spotted Owl territories without adversely impacting territory occupancy if such treatments do not consistently reduce canopy cover below 50%. We suggest that future work quantify components of forest structure (e.g., large tree density, vertical complexity) known to be selected by owls and relate these characteristics to occupancy and fitness metrics.","10.1650/CONDOR-16-66.1","0010-5422 and 1938-5129","","CONDOR","4","747","0010-5422 and 1938-5129",""

Yet the statistical power of these data to distinguish between burned and unburned infiltration is seldom assessed, despite the typically small number of total measurements (N). Here, parametric and nonparametric statistical approaches are used to assess the primary influences on the statistical power and whether the N is sufficient to achieve a representative power of 0.9. About half of the studies examined did not achieve a power >= 0.9 at the as-sampled N, suggesting the need for post-fire infiltration studies to collect more measurements. Effect size was the primary control on power, and therefore the N needed to achieve a given power. Because effect size tends to decrease with time since fire, N generally needs to increase with time since fire in infiltration studies. Power estimates were similar for parametric and nonparametric analyses. Comparisons between infiltration methods suggested that steady state rainfall simulation produced a greater power for a given N, relative to both tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters. The greater power of the steady state rainfall simulation method was the result of smaller variability, compared to the tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters. The substantial variability of post-fire tension infiltrometer measurements may complicate using these data in meta-analyses. This work further suggests that synthesis or meta-analysis studies of post-fire soil-hydraulic properties may be more robust if data are weighted by statistical power. The differences in statistical power between infiltration measurement methods require further demonstration for a broader range of datasets before extrapolation beyond the datasets considered here.","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128019","0022-1694 and 1879-2707","","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","","","0022-1694 and 1879-2707",""

These strategies require full accounting of forest sector GHG budgets. Here, we describe a rigorous approach using over one million observations from forest inventory data and a regionally calibrated life-cycle assessment for calculating cradle-to-grave forest sector emissions and sequestration. We find that Western US forests are net sinks because there is a positive net balance of forest carbon uptake exceeding losses due to harvesting, wood product use, and combustion by wildfire. However, over 100 years of wood product usage is reducing the potential annual sink by an average of 21%, suggesting forest carbon storage can become more effective in climate mitigation through reduction in harvest, longer rotations, or more efficient wood product usage. Of the similar to 10 700 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents removed from west coast forests since 1900, 81% of it has been returned to the atmosphere or deposited in landfills. Moreover, state and federal reporting have erroneously excluded some product-related emissions, resulting in 25%-55% underestimation of state total CO2 emissions. For states seeking to reach GHG reduction mandates by 2030, it is important that state CO2 budgets are effectively determined or claimed reductions will be insufficient to mitigate climate change.","10.1088/1748-9326/ab28bb","1748-9326","","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","9","","1748-9326",""

Fire effects on the components of fungal composition were dependant on the scale of taxonomic resolution. Variation in fungal community composition was correlated with fire severity. Fungal richness and relative abundance of dominant taxa declined with increased fire severity. Yet, in contrast to temperate and boreal regions with frequent wildfires, mycorrhizal fungi on resprouting shrubs in tundra were not strongly differentiated into fire-specialists and fire-sensitive fungi. Instead, dominant fungi, including taxa characteristic of late successional stages, were present regardless of fire severity. It is likely that the resprouting life history strategy of tundra shrubs confers resilience of dominant mycorrhizal fungi to fire disturbance by maintaining an inoculum source on the landscape after fire. Based on these results, we suggest that resprouting shrubs may facilitate post-fire vegetation regeneration and potentially the expansion of trees and shrubs under predicted scenarios of increased warming and fire disturbance in Arctic tundra.","10.2980/20-3-3620","1195-6860 and 2376-7626","","ECOSCIENCE","3","296","1195-6860 and 2376-7626",""

Yet, the reforestation of these landscapes is rarely successful, with a mean planted seedling survival of just 25 %. Given these low rates, we carried out a planting experiment to quantify the impacts of biochar as a soil amendment and shrubs as nurse plants on planted conifer seedling survival and growth following high-severity wildfire. We planted 1200 seedlings of three species (Pinus ponderosa, P. strobiformis, and Pseudotsuga menziesii) in a 2-ha area within the footprint of the Las Conchas fire in New Mexico, USA.

In coniferous and mixed forest, all disturbances except for partial harvest triggered significant increases in the abundance of deer mice and declines in red-backed voles. The increase in deer mice after wildfire was stronger than after clearcutting and marginally stronger than after clearcutting and burning. The abundance of red-backed voles was greatest in undisturbed or partially harvested stands, intermediate after clearcutting, and lowest after wildfire or clearcutting and burning. While the positive effect of clearcutting on deer mice did not persist beyond 10 years after disturbance, the negative effect on red-backed voles was similar between recent and older clearcuts. In deciduous forest, clearcutting did not result in a consistent change in abundance of deer mice and red-backed voles. For other small mammals, recent clearcutting tended to increase the abundance of yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), and meadow and long-tailed voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus and Microtus longicaudus). Woodland jumping mouse (Neozapus insignis), masked shrew (Sorex cinereus), and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) did not show consistent response to timber harvest. Overall, the impact of different disturbances on the abundance of small mammals (i.e. positive or negative) appears to be species-specific, but disturbance type may influence the magnitude of this effect. Disturbance types can be ranked from severe to mild in terms of small mammal responses. The effects of forest harvest on small mammals are not equivalent to those of wildfire. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

After quantitatively analyzing previous research, we detected great variability in responses, with increases, decreases, and no changes being reported for most indicators (e.g., macroinvertebrate richness, fish density, algal biomass, and leaf decomposition). We shed light on these seemingly contradicting results by showing that the presence of extreme hydrological post-fire events, the time lag between fire and sampling, and whether the riparian forest burned or not influenced the outcome of previous research. Results suggest that although wildfires and the following hydrological events can have dramatic impacts in the short term, most biological endpoints recover within 5-10 years, and that detrimental effects are minimal in the case of prescribed fires. We also detected that no effects were more often reported by BACI studies than by CI or BA studies, raising the question of whether this research field may be biased by the inherent limitations of CI and BA designs. Finally, we make recommendations to help advance this field of research and guide future integrated fire management that includes the protection of freshwater ecosystems. Our review found that most research on fire impacts on freshwater ecosystems focused on abiotic endpoints in small streams from North American temperate evergreen forests. Regarding the response of stream biological endpoints to fire, the review showed mixed results influenced by post-fire hydrological events and the condition of riparian forests. While wildfires can cause significant short-term impacts, stream ecosystems often recover within 5-10 years, and prescribed fires have minimal effects.

We show that the dose-response relationship between fire intensity and mortality shifts toward increased vulnerability under drought, indicating higher mortality with increasing drought at any fire intensity. The trajectory we observed in postfire chlorophyll fluorescence, an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency and stress, was an effective early warning sign of impending tree death. Postfire mortality modeling shows that accurate mortality classification can be achieved using prefire physiology and morphology metrics combined with fire intensity. Variable importance measures indicate that physiological condition and fire intensity have greater influence on the classification accuracy than morphological metrics.

We investigated rhizosphere microbial communities in a resprouting Eucalyptus marginata forest, southwestern Australia, that had experienced a severe wildfire four years previously, and a hotter drought eight years previously. Our aim was to understand how microbial communities are affected over longer -term trajectories by hotter drought and wildfire, singularly, and in combination. Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from soil samples, amplified, and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Richness, diversity, composition, and putative functional groups were then examined. We found a monotonic decrease in fungal, but not bacterial, richness and diversity with increasing disturbance with the greatest changes resulting from the combination of drought and wildfire. Overall fungal and bacterial community composition reflected a stronger effect of fire than drought, but the combination of both produced the greatest number of indicator taxa for fungi, and a significant negative effect on the abundance of several fungal functional groups. Key mycorrhizal fungi, fungal saprotrophs and fungal pathogens were found at lower proportions in sites affected by drought plus wildfire. Wildfire had a positive effect on bacterial hydrogen and bacterial nitrogen recyclers. Fungal community composition was positively correlated with live tree height. These results suggest that microbial communities, in particular key fungal functional groups, are highly responsive to wildfire following drought. Thus, a legacy of past climate conditions such as hotter drought can be important for mediating the responses of soil microbial communities to subsequent disturbance like wildfire.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170111","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

Complex fire histories combined with site factors and other disturbances, such insect outbreaks, led to great variation in understory plant communities, and management activities influence future dynamics of both overstory and understory communities. This variation needs to be considered as part of ecosystem-scale efforts to influence future fires and restore the composition and structure of mixed conifer forests. We undertook a systematic review of published studies evaluating effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in western North American mixed conifer forests. Forty-one studies, published in 50 articles, met inclusion criteria and encompassed projects in seven states in the USA and British Columbia in Canada. Total understory plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density) commonly declined in the short term within 4 years after treatment. This may result from damage to plants during tree cutting operations or fire, heavy loadings of slash, little change or even expansion of tree canopies after low-intensity treatments, herbivory, or drought. In contrast, all 7 studies measuring understories longer than 5 years since treatment reported increases in understory metrics. Treatments in these long-term studies also persistently decreased tree canopy cover. Most or all native species endured (even if reduced in abundance) through cutting operations or fire. A model of understory response has emerged that treatments generally do not eliminate species, and often benefit species absent or uncommon in untreated forest. Groups of native species (e.g., Epilobium spp.) appear fire-dependent, because they are uncommon or absent in unburned mixed conifer forests and after tree cutting alone. Cutting and prescribed fire applied together resulted in the greatest invasion of non-native plants, but non-native cover was minimal compared to native cover. Few studies examined influences of intensity of tree cutting or severity of prescribed fire, but overstory understory relationships suggest that treatments must substantially reduce overstory density from maximum values (which can exceed 3000 stems ha(-1) and 80 m(2) ha(-1) basal area) and tree canopy cover to <30-50% cover to elicit appreciable responses from the forest understory. Few studies examined understory dynamics after wildfire relative to unburned forest, and further work is warranted because wildfire is a likely eventual outcome of passive management in these forests. Across a broad region from the southwestern United States into Canada, prescribed fire and tree cutting consistently increased disturbance-promoted native species in the short term and total understory abundance in the long term. Active management using tree cutting and fire will likely benefit both biodiversity conservation and fire management in current mixed conifer forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we analyse data from 48 sites in savanna grasslands, broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning up to 65 years, during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each site. We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil carbon and nitrogen that was non-saturating through time, having 36 per cent (+/- 13 per cent) less carbon and 38 per cent (+/- 16 per cent) less nitrogen after 64 years than plots that were protected from fire. Fire-driven carbon and nitrogen losses were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests, but not in temperate and boreal needleleaf forests. We also observe comparable soil carbon and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model simulations of global vegetation. The model study predicts that the long-term losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20 per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same period. Furthermore, we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include multidecadal changes in soil carbon, especially in drier savanna grasslands. Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth, altering the carbon sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests.","10.1038/nature24668","0028-0836 and 1476-4687","","NATURE","7687","194","0028-0836 and 1476-4687",""

If post-fire differences in microbial communities affect soil carbon (C) pool dynamics, altered microbial communities could influence the transition of forests from C sources to C sinks during ecosystem recovery. For example, fire may change the abundance of copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria, influencing the kinetic rates of soil C pools due to differences in C-acquisition strategies and nutrient requirements. We assessed differences in soil bacterial communities and soil C pool kinetics 1 year after a wildfire in a mixed-conifer forest in northern California, United States. We determined whether differences in bacterial communities and soil C pools were related to copiotrophic versus oligotrophic life history strategies. Specifically, we assessed bacterial community oligotrophy versus copiotrophy based on phyla relative abundances and predicted 16S gene copy numbers. We then determined whether these life-histories were correlated with C pool kinetic rates. We further determined whether C degradation metabolic pathways predicted using PICRUSt2 were related to C pool kinetics. We found that copiotrophic bacteria exhibited greater abundance in burned areas than unburned areas, evidenced by increases in 16S rRNA gene copy number and by taxonomic classifications. Furthermore, the abundance of predicted metabolic pathways associated with fast-cycling C compounds increased with severity, including carbohydrate, alcohol, and amine degradation pathways, suggesting increased copiotrophic metabolic strategies. In contrast, the abundance of metabolic pathways of slow-cycling aromatic C compounds did not change, indicating oligotrophic metabolic strategies did not increase. The kinetic rate of the active C pool was positively related to the copiotrophic metabolic pathway of alcohol degradation, and negatively related to oligotrophic pathways like aromatic compound degradation. The links between C pool kinetics and phylum-level life-strategy classifications were ambiguous. Overall, our results suggest that metabolic life-strategies are related to soil C pool kinetics and could have short- and long-term impacts on soil C persistence during post-fire recovery. In the short-term, increased copiotrophy could increase soil C efflux via rapid cycling of labile C pools. However, over the longer-term lower prevalence of oligotrophic strategies could allow aromatic compounds associated with pyrogenic C to accumulate, increasing stable soil C stocks.","10.3389/ffgc.2022.873527","2624-893X","","FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE","","","2624-893X",""

The amount of coarse woody debris (CWD) and diversity of polypores in old-growth forests and in forests at three natural post-fire successional stages (young, middle-aged, old) were compared with managed forests at comparable successional stages. Fire created a high amount of CWD, providing a supply of dead wood for saproxylic species for at least 50-70 y. Dead wood volumes remained high throughout the natural forest succession, exceeding at all stages 18 m(3) ha(-1), the threshold value established in the study for the occurrence of red-listed species. The richness of polypore species was highest on young post-fire sites, and their species composition, including red-listed species, was comparable to that of old-growth forests (>300 y) used as references. The amount of CWD in natural post-fire forests was over two to twenty times higher than that on clear-cut sites, and species diversity on clear-cut sites was considerably lower than on sites undergoing natural succession, with no occurrences of red-listed species. A relatively diverse polypore flora was found in selectively logged forests, likely due to rather a high volume and continuity of spruce CWD. The results indicate a strong but non-linear relationship between total volume of CWD and species richness of polypores, but successional stage and naturalness also explained part of the variation. The species assemblages were influenced most by the decay stage of CWD, tree species composition and naturalness of the site. The results demonstrate the importance of old-growth and young post-fire forests as landscape-level habitats and species pools, especially for red-listed species. We recommend that old-growth spruce forests be preserved whenever possible and that high CWD volumes be generated locally for red-listed species, for example, by prescribed burning. Regeneration forests for spruce, extended rotation periods and the use of logging techniques other than clear-cutting would help in maintaining species diversity in spruce-associated species in boreal forests.

Forests of the Rogue River Basin in Oregon, USA, are both productive and fire-prone due to ample winter precipitation and summer drought; yet management in this region is strongly influenced by forest practices that depend on fire exclusion. Regionally, climate change is increasing fire frequency, elevating the importance of understanding historically frequent-fire regimes. We use cross-dated fire-scars to characterize historical fire return intervals, seasonality, and relationships with climate beginning in 1650 CE for 13 sites representative of southwestern Oregon dry forests. Using systematic literature review, we link our local fire histories to a regional dataset and evaluate our data relative to more intensively studied conifer/hardwood forest types in California. Fire-scars show that fires in the Rogue Basin were frequent and regular until disrupted in the 1850s through 1910s, corresponding with forced displacement of Native Americans and Euro-American settlement. Median historical fire return intervals were 8 years at the stand-scale (< 25 ha), with site medians ranging from five to 14 years and no significant differences between sampled vegetation types. Burn seasonality was broadly distributed with 47% of recorded fires in the latewood (midsummer), 30% at the ring boundary (late summer and fall), and 23% in the earlywood (spring and early summer). The number of sites recording fire each year was associated with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (ENSO). Fires were detected in the study area every other year, and synchrony among sites was associated with stronger annual drought. The ENSO synchronization of fire suggests an herbaceous fuel signal, with warm winters/wet summers two years prior to widespread fire-years, a pattern observed globally in fuel-limited systems. Stand-scale fire histories in the Klamath, southern Cascades, and northern Sierra Nevada ecoregions resemble Rogue River Basin stand-scale fire histories. Across dry mixed conifer, yellow pine, and mixed evergreen forests, fire return intervals converged on 8 years. Moist mixed conifer and red fir forests exhibited 13-year fire return intervals. Across ecoregions, fire periodicity was weakly correlated with climatic water deficit, but well-modeled by elevation, precipitation, and temperature. These data highlight the need for decadal fire and burning outside of the contemporary fire season for forest restoration and climate adaptation in the dry forests of the Rogue Basin.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.07.010","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","43","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire-15 years since the last fire event and Abandoned-36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum-Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration.","10.1007/s11056-017-9586-4","0169-4286 and 1573-5095","","NEW FORESTS","5","573","0169-4286 and 1573-5095",""

Further collected data included bird species nesting in the cavities and nest-building type (nonexcavator/excavator), forest type (coniferous/deciduous/mixed), biome (temperate/boreal), and naturalness (managed/natural). From these data, three effect sizes were calculated that describe potential nest trees in terms of DBH, vital status (dead/alive), and crown status (broken/intact). These tree characteristics can be easily recognized by foresters. The results show that on average large-diameter trees, dead trees, and trees with broken crowns were selected for nesting. The magnitude of this effect varied depending primarily on bird species and the explanatory variables forest type and naturalness. Biome had lowest influence (indicated by AIC).

Methods We analysed the impacts of fire on C and N dynamics in tropical ecosystems through a meta-analysis of 1,420 observations from 87 studies. Results Fire reduced both above- and below-ground C and N pools, with greater reductions above- than below-ground. Fire decreased soil total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-) and increased ammonium nitrogen (NH4+) in surface mineral soil layers but did not affect those in deep layers. Fire decreased TC and TN in savanna but did not affect those in tropical dry and moist forests. Fire did not affect NH4+ and NO3- in savanna because of non-significant responses of N mineralization rate (N-min) to fire. Conversely, fire increased NH4+ and decreased NO3- in tropical dry forest, but did not affect NH4+ and increased NO3- in tropical moist forest owing to thermal decomposition of soil organic N and increased soil nitrification, respectively. Moreover, NH4+ declined and NO3- increased initially and then decreased with time after fire. Above- and below-ground response variables to prescribed fire were mediated largely by fire frequency and experimental duration, respectively.

We sampled three mineral soil horizons (A, E, and Bh) to elucidate prescribed fire impacts across the soil profile. Our results indicate that only the A horizon was affected by the fire interval manipulations, whereas the deeper E and Bh horizons were minimally impacted. Richness of both bacterial and fungal communities in recurring fire treatments was higher than, and their community composition different from, those in the unburned control in A horizon soils. Similar to the biotic soil attributes, fire interval treatments altered soil chemistry only in the top-most A horizon: the burned treatments had higher total nitrogen, total carbon, phosphorus, and NH4+ than the fire exclusion treatment; the soil chemistry of the deeper E and Bh horizons did not differ among the treatments. All soil chemistry properties correlated with bacterial community composition of the A horizon and nearly all properties correlated with fungal community composition of the A horizon as well, especially when comparing the more frequent burns to the fire exclusion treatment. Indicator taxon analyses identified fire-responsive bacteria and fungi, such as Ktedonobacteria sp. and an unclassified ascomycete that were abundant in the fire exclusion treatment and the ectomycorrhizal Russula spp. that were most abundant in the annual burn treatment. The different fire intervals also impacted fungal guilds, suggesting shifts in community function. The fire exclusion treatment was enriched with ectomycorrhizal, lichenized, and wood saprotrophic fungi, whereas the annual burn treatment was enriched with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi compared to the other treatments.

It is recommended, however, that mulch coverage should be at least 60% based on the trade-off between economic costs and ecological benefits, which can reduce runoff and soil loss by approximately 50% and 80%, respectively. An application rate of 0.3-0.4 kg m(- 2) for straw and 0.6-0.8 kg m(- 2) for wood-based mulch should be sufficient to effectively control soil erosion. The study also found that mulching is more effective in post-fire forests on medium-textured soils and less effective on steep slopes (>60%) and under both natural and simulated extremely heavy rainfall conditions (>90 mm/h). Overall, this study provides further insights into the impact of mulching on water erosion globally and proposes an overall framework for a precision mulching strategy (P-M-S) to guide the implementation of mulching in soil erosion control.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116643","0016-7061 and 1872-6259","","GEODERMA","","","0016-7061 and 1872-6259",""

However, whether the results obtained on productivity can be generalized to other ecosystem processes remains unclear. We investigated the effects of tree species mixtures on fine root biomass turnover and biomass loss from mortality by sampling 18 stands dominated by Populus tremuloides and Pinus banksiana, respectively, and their relatively even mixtures in post-fire boreal forests of two stand ages (8 and 34 years following stand-replacing fire). Fine root biomass turnover and mortality were higher in mixtures than expected from those of single species-dominated stands in both stand ages, with a higher magnitude of mixture effects in the 34-year-old than in the 8-year-old stands. Mixture effects on turnover and mortality did not differ with soil depth in 8-year-old stands, but turnover increased while mortality decreased from the forest floor to the mineral layers in 34-year-old stands. Both turnover and mortality significantly increased with tree species evenness in 34-year-old stands, but not in 8-year-old stands. Root turnover and biomass loss from mortality were positively associated with annual fine root production across all stand types and ages. Our results provide the first evidence for positive mixture effects on fine root biomass turnover and biomass loss from mortality in natural forests. Moreover, our results suggest that the positive mixture effects resulted from increased competition induced by the increase of fine root biomass production in tree species mixtures.","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.03.015","0038-0717","","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","","130","0038-0717",""

The continued proliferation of publications and growth of data sets, data synthesis and meta-analysis approaches allows the application of powerful tools to such questions at ever finer scales. In this analysis, we combined a literature review and effect-size meta-analysis with two large, independent, observational databases to assess how land use and management impact SOC stocks, primarily with regards to forest land uses. We performed this work for the (Great Lakes) U.S. Lake States, which comprise 6% of the land area, but 7% of the forest and 9% of the forest SOC in the United States, as the second in a series of ecoregional SOC assessments. Most importantly, our analysis indicates that natural factors, such as soil texture and parent material, exert more control over SOC stocks than land use or management. With that for context, our analysis also indicates which natural factors most influence management impacts on SOC storage. We report an overall trend of significantly diminished topsoil SOC stocks with harvesting, consistent across all three data sets, while also demonstrating how certain sites and soils diverge from this pattern, including some that show opposite trends. Impacts of fire grossly mirror those of harvesting, with declines near the top of the profile, but potential gains at depth and no net change when considering the whole profile. Land use changes showing significant SOC impacts are limited to reforestation on barren mining substrates (large and variable gains) and conversion of native forest to cultivation (losses). We describe patterns within the observational data that reveal the physical basis for preferential land use, e.g., cultivation of soils with the most favorable physical properties, and forest plantation establishment on the most marginal soils, and use these patterns to identify management opportunities and considerations. We also qualify our results with ratings of confidence, based on their degree of support across approaches, and offer concise, defensible tactics for adapting management operations to site-specific criteria and SOC vulnerability.","10.1002/eap.2356","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","6","","1051-0761 and 1939-5582",""

In many western North American forests, the keystone disturbance is fire, and a plethora of research exists characterizing various fire regime parameters, although often only one or two parameters are addressed in individual studies. I performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of the derived data from 26 publications to characterize five parameters of the historical fire regime of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) ecosystems in Colorado, USA: fire frequency, severity, extent, seasonality, and climate. Results The collection of evidence indicates a fire regime predominantly characterized by moderate to high frequency, low- and mixed-severity fires that occurred in late summer to fall, with fires occurring in drier than average years that were often preceded by two to three years of wetter than average conditions. The overall average mean fire return interval (MFI) was 21 years (SD = 1.4 years, n = 78 sites) and increased with site elevation (r = 0.33, P < 0.05). Low- and mixed-severity fires accounted for 83% of all observations, and 69% of fires occurred in late summer to fall with no relationship found between latitude and seasonality. Geographic region (Front Range and southwestern Colorado) was associated with variability in fire regime parameter values, with southwestern Colorado sites having a stronger association with wetter than average conditions in the three years preceding fire years and a shorter mean MFI (18 years) relative to Front Range sites (23 years). Data were insufficient to evaluate changes in fire severity and extent due to a lack of historical information, as well as differences in sampling methods and reporting. Conclusion This meta-analytic approach identified variation within and among fire regime parameter values that occurred along elevational and geographic axes, and this information should be useful to managers engaging in forest restoration aimed at enhancing resilience of fire-adapted forests to disturbance and climate change.","10.1186/s42408-019-0056-6","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","1","","1933-9747",""

Conversely, wetland restoration increases CH4 emissions by 544.4%, primarily attributable to elevated water table depth. Forest and grassland restoration have no significant effect on N2O emissions, while wetland restoration reduces N2O emissions by 68.6%. Wetland restoration enhances net CO2 uptake, and the transition from net CO2 sources to net sinks takes approximately 4 years following restoration.

Diameter distributions were based on 31,517 live trees within 76 pretreatment units and 25,061 live trees within 85 posttreatment units. Cross-site comparisons were made using meta-analysis. Values for 10th percentile diameter increased at two sites, values for 90th percentile diameter increased at six sites, and values for mean diameter increased at five sites (P < 0.05) after active treatments (thin, burn, or thin + burn) compared with control sites. Across the seven western FFS study sites, the overall effect size of the thin treatment increased for 90th percentile and mean diameter, the overall effect size of the burn treatment increased for 10th percentile, 90th percentile, and mean diameter, and the overall effect size of the thin + burn treatment increased for 10th percentile, 90th percentile, and mean diameter. This work indicates that although each of the active treatments was effective in shifting diameter distributions toward larger trees, no single treatment or entry will probably mitigate nearly a century of fire exclusion and fuel accumulation in dry coniferous forests of the western United States.

An innovative web crawler tool was employed to help critically synthesize the information in the literature. The literature suggests that climate change will impact nutrient dynamics around the globe and exacerbate contemporary water-quality challenges. Nutrient leaching and overland flow transport are projected to increase globally, promoted by extreme precipitation. Seasonal variations in stream flow are expected to emulate changing precipitation patterns, but the specific local impacts of climate change on hydrology and nutrient dynamics will vary both seasonally and regionally. Plant activity may reduce some of this load in nonagricultural soils if the expected increase in plant uptake of nutrients prompted by increased temperatures can compensate for greater nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization, N deposition, and leaching rates. High-temperature forest and grass fires may help reduce mineralization and microbial turnover by altering N speciation via the pyrolysis of organic matter. In agricultural areas that are at higher risk of erosion, extreme precipitation will exacerbate existing water-quality issues, and greater plant nutrient uptake may lead to an increase in fertilizer use. Future urban expansion will amplify these effects. Higher ambient temperatures will promote harmful cyanobacterial blooms by enhancing thermal stratification, increasing nutrient load into streams and lakes from extreme precipitation events, decreasing summer flow and thus baseflow dilution capacity, and increasing water and nutrient residence times during increasingly frequent droughts. Land management decisions must consider the nuanced regional and seasonal changes identified in this review (realized and predicted). Such knowledge is critical to increasing international cooperation and accelerating action toward the United Nations's global sustainability goals and the specific objectives of the Conference of Parties (COP) 26.","10.1139/er-2021-0109","1208-6053 and 1181-8700","","ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS","","","1208-6053 and 1181-8700",""

Species richness typically was slightly greater inside p exclosures than in adjacent grazed sites (median = 2 more species inside exclosures), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.16).

Cryptogam cover differences between grazed sites and exclosures tended to increase with the number of years of grazing exclusion (r = 0.64, P = 0.046). Pseudoroegneria spicata, a principal livestock forage, averaged greater basal cover inside exclosures than outside on 4 of 10 sites where it occurred, although no exclosure sites had greater P spicata cover on grazed sites. Meta-analysis of the 10 sites indicated that grazing exclusion resulted in greater P spicata cover compared with adjacent grazed areas (P less than or equal to 0.05). Poa secunda, a short-growing grass that initiates growth early in the spring and is not important livestock forage, averaged greater basal cover outside exclosores on 5 of 15 sites where it occurred.

Grazing exclusion resulted in greater screening cover in the herb-low shrub layer (0-0.5 m height; P less than or equal to 0.05). These results indicate that despite improved livestock grazing management over the past half century, livestock grazing still can limit the potential of native plant communities in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, and that the health of semiarid ecosystems can improve with livestock exclusion in the absence of other disturbances. A few exclosure sites were similar for the measured parameters, suggesting that these sites were ecologically stable and that exclusion of livestock grazing was not sufficient to move succession toward more pristine conditions, at least within the time periods studied.

These are slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), plan curvature, wind effect, annual temperature and rainfall, soil texture, distance to roads, rivers, and villages, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land use. Forest fire locations were identified using MODIS images, historical records, and extensive field checking. 106 (approximate to 70%) locations, out of 151 forest fires identified, were used for models building/training, while the remaining 45 (approximate to 30%) cases were used for the models validation. BRT, GAM, and RF data mining models were used to distinguish between presence and absence of forest fires and its mapping. These algorithms were used to perform feature selection in order to reveal the variables that contribute more to forest fire occurrence.

In general, the forest growth is projected to increase mainly in northern Finland. In the south, the growing conditions may become suboptimal, particularly for Norway spruce. Although the wind climate does not change remarkably, wind damage risk will increase especially in the south, because of the shortening of the soil frost period. The risk of snow damage is anticipated to increase in the north and decrease in the south. Increasing drought in summer will boost the risk of large-scale forest fires. Also, the warmer climate increases the risk of bark beetle outbreaks and the wood decay by Heterobasidion root rot in coniferous forests. The probability of detrimental cascading events, such as those caused by a large-scale wind damage followed by a widespread bark beetle outbreak, will increase remarkably in the future.

Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based remote sensing (RS) provides valuable support for wildfire management efforts, enhancing both spatial and temporal resolution. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current applications of UAS operations for combating the wildfire worldwide. RS applications of UAS has been explored during the three stages of wildfire, including Pre-fire, Active-fire, and Post-fire, with a particular emphasis on the types of information collected and data processing methods. The pre-fire section assesses fire potentials, the active-fire stage focuses on fire surveillance and propagation, while the post-fire stage focuses on studies assessing wildfire impact using UAS. In addition, the review provides a comprehensive overview of UAS navigation techniques adapted to fire surveillance. The literature review was conducted using three bibliographic databases, including Science Direct, IEEE Explore, and Scopus, and 186 articles relevant to UAS applications in wildfires were manually gathered. This literature review encompasses 119 articles focused on RS, 40 articles related to navigation, and the remaining articles covering reviews, concept proposals, UAS designs, and solutions addressing technical limitations of UASs in the context of wildfire management. This review offers a comprehensive overview of recent UAS operations for future researchers aiming to utilize UAS technologies for efficient wildfire management. The findings highlight the need for further investigation into the onboard computational capacities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, precise fuel load estimation, considering individual vegetation, and field experiments to evaluate and validate navigation algorithms.","10.1080/01431161.2023.2249604","0143-1161 and 1366-5901","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING","18","5628","0143-1161 and 1366-5901",""

We then compared the global annual GHG emissions from natural systems with those generated by human activity. The results indicate that the global annual GHG emissions range approximately between 54.33 and 75.50 Gt CO2-eq, of which natural emissions account for 18.13-39.30 Gt CO2-eq, with the most likely value being approximately 29.07 Gt CO2-eq. According to the GCP report, the global anthropogenic emissions have increased from 22 Gt CO2-eq in 1990 to 36.2 Gt CO2-eq in 2016. The amounts of natural and anthropogenic GHGs emissions are roughly of the same order of magnitude. Anthropogenic emissions account for approximately 55.46% of the total global GHGs emissions (2016 value), i.e., the ratio of natural to anthropogenic emissions is approximately 0.8. In addition, the annual amount of GHGs absorbed by Earth systems (ocean and terrestrial ecosystems) ranges between approximately 14.4 Gt CO2-eq and 26.5 Gt CO2-eq, with natural system GHG emissions and sinks also having roughly the same order of magnitude. This finding indicates that the GHG emissions generated by human activity exert extra pressure on what is otherwise a self-balancing Earth system.","10.1016/j.accre.2018.12.003","1674-9278","","ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH","4","243","1674-9278",""

Extreme droughts, which are more often prolonged, can increase the risk of forest fires, not only in southern Europe but also, in Central Europe. Nonetheless, catastrophic fire events are not well recognized in the Central European Lowlands (CEL), where large forest complexes are located. Knowledge of past fire activity in this part of Europe is scarce, although several fires have occurred in this area during the previous millennia. Large coniferous forest monocultures located in the CEL are highly susceptible to fires and other disturbances. Here, we present a case study from the Tuchola Pinewoods (TP; northern Poland), where large pine monocultures are present. The main aim of this study is to document the potential effects past land management has on modern day disturbance regimes using state-of-the-art paleoecological data, historical documents and cartographic materials. We then present a protocol that will help forest managers utilize long-term paleoecological records. Based on paleoecological investigations, historical documents, and cartographic materials, our results show that, in the past 300 years, the TP witnessed not only disastrous fires and but also windfalls by tornados and insect outbreaks. A change in management from Polish to Prussian/German in the 18th century led to the transformation of mixed forests into Scots pine monocultures with the purpose to allow better economic use of the forest. Those administrative decisions led to an ecosystem highly susceptible to disturbances. This article provides a critical review of past forest management as well as future research directions related to the impacts of fire risk on land management and ecosystem services: (a) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity); (b) natural water management; and (c) mitigation of climate changes. Designated forest conditions, management, and future fire risk are a controversial and highly debated topic of forest management by Forestry Units. More research will allow the gathering of reliable information pertinent to management practices with regard to the current fire risks.

Compiling accurate and spatially comprehensive fuel information is necessary to inform various aspects of land management in forested environments. Remote sensing may offer distinct advantages for this in comparison to traditional site-based approaches. We conducted a literature review of the past 10 years of research in the remote sensing of fire fuel in forested environments, with a focus on emerging methods of fuel estimation, and the fuel attributes estimated. We position our review of remote sensing research in relation to the fuel attributes that influence fire behaviour, as suggested by contemporary physics-based fire behaviour knowledge, and a summary of fuel inputs to widely applied forest fire behaviour models. We find a disconnect between recent remote sensing research and fuel characterisations relevant to contemporary fire behaviour knowledge. Specifically, we find a tendency in remote sensing research towards estimation of forest overstorey fuel attributes, and a relative lack of research that estimates more obscured, though highly relevant, fuel components such as understorey, surface, and bark fuel. We also find a tendency for recent remote sensing research to conceptualise fire fuel by existing fire behaviour models, with particular emphasis on matching pre-existing fuel model classifications. A case is made for remotely sensed forest fuel estimation grounded in current knowledge of fire behaviour processes and the fuel attributes known to influence these processes. Shortcomings in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes are partly due to inherent limitations of current technologies, and we discuss recent and expected advancements in remote sensing research and technology that may drive significant future advancement in forest fuel estimation. Further, we suggest that recognition of interactions between fuel attributes and measurable biophysical forest properties can assist in addressing present limitations in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes. Such process-based methods would be more spatially and temporally applicable, encourage new techniques for estimating fuel attributes using remote sensing data, and may encourage the development of fire behaviour and risk prediction systems that are more suited to remote sensing.","10.1016/j.rse.2020.112282","0034-4257 and 1879-0704","","REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT","","","0034-4257 and 1879-0704",""

To draw a more consistent picture of the organic carbon amount present in solid precipitation that accumulates on cold glaciers, we here review available data and, when needed, complete the data set with analyses of selected samples. The different data sets are then discussed by considering the age (modern versus pre-industrial, Holocene versus Last glacial Maximum) and type (surface snow, firn, or ice) of investigated samples, the deployed method, and the applied contamination control. Finally, the OC (DOC or TOC) levels of Antarctic, Greenland, and Alpine ice cores are compared and discussed with respect to natural (biomass burning, vegetation emissions) and anthropogenic sources (fossil fuel combustion) contributing to atmospheric OC aerosol.","10.5194/cp-9-2195-2013","1814-9324 and 1814-9332","","CLIMATE OF THE PAST","5","2195","1814-9324 and 1814-9332",""

Real-time availability of this value would thus be a great benefit to fire risk management and prevention. However, the comprehensive literature review in this paper shows that there is no easy-to-use method for automated measurements available. This study investigates the applicability of four different sensor types (permittivity and electrical resistance measuring principles) for this measurement. Comparisons were made to manual gravimetric reference measurements carried out almost daily for one fire season and overall agreement was good (highly significant correlations with 0.792 < = r < = 0.947, p < 0.001). Standard deviations within sensor types were linearly correlated to daily sensor mean values; however, above a certain threshold they became irregular, which may be linked to exceedance of the working ranges. Thus, measurements with irregular standard deviations were considered unusable and relationships between gravimetric and automatic measurements of all individual sensors were compared only for useable periods. A large drift in these relationships became obvious from drought to drought period. This drift may be related to installation effects or settling and decomposition of the litter layer throughout the fire season. Because of the drift and the in situ calibration necessary, it cannot be recommended to use the methods presented here for monitoring purposes and thus operational hazard management. However, they may be interesting for scientific studies when some manual fuel moisture measurements are made anyway. Additionally, a number of potential methodological improvements are suggested.","10.5194/nhess-16-403-2016","1561-8633 and 1684-9981","","NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES","2","403","1561-8633 and 1684-9981",""

Consequently, it has affected global forests, forest-dependent communities, and the forest industry. The current study examines academic research focusing on the Pandemic's effects on the overall forestry sector by conducting a bibliometric analysis followed by a literature review in light of themes identified from the bibliometric analysis itself. We identified relevant studies in the Web of Science database, and the metadata of the selected studies was analyzed using the R-based Biblioshiny application. We identified the studies' sources, focus areas, impacts, locations, and themes through the bibliometrics analysis. Then, the findings of the studies were reviewed and summarized based on the identified themes. One dominant theme was forest recreation, with urban forests increasingly serving as stress-relieving and social spaces for communities during the Pandemic. Conversely, reduced ecotourism and forest park visits adversely affected some communities and conservation efforts that depend on tourism income. Loss of livelihoods and diminished enforcement in some regions exacerbated pressures on forests, leading to heightened deforestation, poaching, land encroachments, and forest fires. Some authorities adapted to the challenge by integrating online technologies into forest management and conservation efforts. Some forest-dependent communities were disproportionately affected, raising concerns about indigenous rights. The forest industry faced challenges such as labor shortages and fluctuations in the supply, demand, and prices of forest products, as indicated in several studies. The study offers insights into the existing literature and identifies research gaps. It provides essential information for better preparedness in the face of future disruptive events and informs the development of policies to protect our forests.","10.1016/j.forpol.2023.103103","1389-9341 and 1872-7050","","FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS","","","1389-9341 and 1872-7050",""

The framework applied to bioenergy in communitybased forestry in Mexico with participation of community and local stakeholders revealed sustainability indicator priorities and relevance in regards to occupational injury, illness and fatalities, training and/or education, use of renewable energy and household income (economic pillar); access to household electricity service, to municipal water supply, to sewerage service and to fuel, and female participation (social pillar); the loss of natural resources and grazing land, waste reduction for energy and sewage water treatment (environmental pillar). Indicators related to streetlighting were downplayed by the participants while forest fires, soil erosion, reduction of waste burning, and reduction of water use were indicators derived from the concerns expressed by the participants. The framework was useful for capturing stakeholders' relevance and priorities to make indicator selection more realistic in measuring the bioenergy impacts and co-benefits for local community. The framework using a participatory approach allows for validation with stakeholders across the scales (local, regional, and national) which can be applied to other bioenergy case studies. The framework is also a step towards an approach integrating bottom-up and top-down perspectives.","10.1016/j.erss.2024.103425","2214-6296 and 2214-6326","","ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE","","","2214-6296 and 2214-6326",""

The concept of intensification has been widely used in Pacific archaeological sequences and has been linked to both population growth and sociopolitical competition within limited land areas. However, intensification is difficult to demonstrate in prehistoric contexts with the rigour required by human geographers and economists. Simple reliance on archaeological features which have required high labour input risks confusing the state of intensity of a particular system with the process of intensification. Identification of intensification demands a chronological comparison of labour input and productivity in successive periods. In the Pacific, archaeological evidence of forest fires and erosion close to first colonization is often interpreted as marking a prior stage of non-intensive swidden agriculture. The subsequent appearance of high-labour-input devices such as irrigated pondfields is treated as proof that intensification has occurred. But these criteria are not exclusive markers of non-intensive swiddening or later intensification. Pacific crop production systems, which are horticultural rather than agricultural, have always included intensive components. Any additional intensification which has appeared land disappeared) may be more closely linked to fine-grained ecological adaptations than to social pressures.","10.1086/200021","0011-3204","","CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY","3","311","0011-3204",""

Such an overview provides a basis for modelling the possible impacts of climate change and enables one to assess trends in disturbance regimes in different countries and/or periods. Over the period 1950-2000, an annual average of 35 million m(3) wood was damaged by disturbances; there was much variation between years. Storms were responsible for 53% of the total damage, fire for 16%, snow for 3% and other abiotic causes for 5%. Biotic factors caused 16% of the damage, and half of this was caused by bark beetles. For 7% of the damage, no cause was given or there was a combination of causes. The 35 million m(3) of damage is about 8.1% of the total fellings in Europe and about 0.15% of the total volume of growing stock. Over the period 1961-2000, the average annual area of forest fires was 213 000 ha, which is 0.15% of the total forest area in Europe. Most types of damage seem to be increasing. This is partly an artefact of the improved availability of information. The most likely explanations for an increase in damage from disturbances are changes in forest management and resulting changes in the condition of the forest. Forest area, average volume of growing stock and average stand age have increased considerably, making the forest more vulnerable and increasing the resources that can be damaged. Since forest resources are expected to continue to increase, it is likely that damage from disturbances will also increase in future.","10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00684.x","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","11","1620","1354-1013 and 1365-2486",""

We assume an estimate of the fire propaga-tion times between adjacent nodes and use the minimum travel time principle to model the fire propa-gation at a landscape-level. The effect of locating a resource in a node is that it becomes protected and the fire propagation to its unburned adjacent nodes is delayed. Therefore, the problem is to identify the most promising nodes to locate the resources, which is solved by a novel iterated local search (ILS) meta -heuristic. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model from the literature is used to validate the proposed method in 32 grid networks with sizes 6x6, 10x10, 20x20 and 30x30, with two different number of fire suppression resources (64 problems). Our ILS produced optimal solutions in 40 cases out of 41 known optimal lower bounds.

We used Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework to structure the development and refinement of fuzzy cognitive maps with stakeholders across the Kenai River fishery in Alaska, USA. The process yielded a model characterizing the structure and function of the Kenai River fishery. The model was then used to guide interviews with stakeholders focused on the effects of the 2019 Swan Lake Fire. We identified seven direct pathways through which fire can affect the social and ecological components of a coastal fishery. We also used the model to guide a targeted literature review to further explore how fire can affect the components of the Kenai River fishery. This synthesis of information allowed us to develop a more complete understanding of the impacts of fire on the fishery-an understanding informed by input from local stakeholders (via our interviews) and relevant scientific and management literature (via our literature review). Lastly, we used the model to assess the fishery's vulnerability to fire. We discuss how early run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha constitute a highly vulnerable component of the system and have the greatest potential to impact the fishery as a whole through a chain of negative social and ecological interactions. This final step illustrates how the model can be used to assess the vulnerability of system components to specific threats. The model of the Kenai River fishery provides an empirically grounded and easily understood visual representation of the complex dynamics affecting coastal fisheries. As such, it can be used to structure discussions among managers and stakeholders, organize our understanding of how fire affects fisheries, and assess vulnerabilities to endogenous and exogenous stressors.","10.1002/mcf2.10240","1942-5120","","MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES","3","","1942-5120",""

Although forest fires are generally regarded as mainly responsible for causing boreal forests to transition to a carbon source, other factors, such as the activity of exotic earthworm species, could also play an important role. Invasive and exotic species of earthworm can affect nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and forest dynamics. In this context, greater knowledge of the distribution of exotic species of earthworm could help researchers to understand the likely changes in the ecosystems that they have colonized. Herein, we report the results of an exhaustive literature review of the presence of exotic species of earthworm in the Canadian boreal forest and taiga zones. We identified 230 sectors containing 14 earthworm species (11 exotic, two native, and one putative native) in six provinces and three territories across Canada's boreal forest and taiga zone. We also report 23 as-yet unpublished observations from the province of Quebec. We noted the presence of earthworms in environments (acid soils, harsh climate) that were historically considered inadequate for their survival. This suggests that the portion of Canada's boreal forests suitable for the presence or colonization of exotic species of earthworm is larger than was previously believed. This study represents the first compilation of locations with exotic species of earthworm in this large northern area. Factors that could affect their distribution and potential effects on boreal ecosystems are also discussed.

We conducted a scoping literature review on the evaluation of risk communication for extreme weather and climate change to inform local public health messaging, consistent with requirements under the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS), which were updated in 2018 to include effective communication regarding climate change and extreme weather. Methods: Search strategies were developed by library information specialists and used to retrieve peer-reviewed academic and grey literature from bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL) and Google country specific searches, respectively. The search strategy was validated through a workshop with experts and community stakeholders, with expertise in environment, health, emergency management and risk communication. Results: A total of 43 articles were included. These articles addressed issues such as: climate change (n = 22), flooding (n = 12), hurricane events (n = 5), extreme heat (n = 2), and wild fires (n = 2). Studies were predominantly from the US (n = 14), Europe (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). Conclusion: To meet the OPHS 2018, public health practitioners need to engage in effective risk communication to motivate local actions that mitigate the effects of extreme weather and climate change. Based on the scoping review, risk communication efforts during short-term extreme weather events appear to be more effective than efforts to communicate risk around climate change. This distinction could highlight a unique opportunity for public health to adapt strategies commonly used for extreme weather to climate change.","10.24095/hpcdp.39.4.06","2368-738X","","HEALTH PROMOTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IN CANADA-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE","4","142","2368-738X",""

Billions of dollars in damage have been sustained and numerous lives lost. It is necessary now to assess vulnerabilities, rank resources at risk, and prioritize adaptation actions. The Forest Service has recently been involved in infrastructure vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategy projects involving climate model studies, interviews, a literature review, local workshops, website information, and publication of the project findings. Different agency vulnerability assessment methods have been reviewed to establish a functional assessment and risk analysis methodology. Efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change have included greenhouse gas reduction from agency vehicles, evaluating alternative transportation routes, implementing energy-saving measures, and identifying ""stormproofing"" road design measures to reduce the vulnerability of roads to extreme climate-related events. Much of the effort has been the identification of road adaptation and resiliency measures, particularly measures that are practical and implementable at minimum cost. These measures include: routine road maintenance; relocating road segments as needed; adding trash racks and diversion prevention dips to prevent culvert failures; building stream simulation projects; protecting bridges from debris and scour; covering soil with deep-rooted vegetation; and using soil bioengineering stabilization and deep-patch shoulder reinforcement to prevent local slope failures.","10.1177/03611981221148701","0361-1981 and 2169-4052","","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD","","","0361-1981 and 2169-4052",""

Since the existence and duration of the smoldering combustion in LIWs is usually unknown, holdover time is conventionally defined as the time between the lightning event that ignited the fire and the time the fire is detected. Therefore, all LIWs have an associated holdover time, which may range from a few minutes to several days. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of holdover times. Here, we introduce a global database on holdover times of LIWs. We have collected holdover time data from 29 different studies across the world through a literature review and datasets assembled by authors of the original studies. The database is composed of three data files (censored data, non-censored data, ancillary data) and three metadata files (description of database variables, list of references, reproducible examples). Censored data are the core of the database and consist of different frequency distributions reporting the number or relative frequency of LIWs per interval of holdover time. In addition, ancillary data provide further information to understand the methods and contexts in which the data were generated in the original studies. The first version of the database contains 42 frequency distributions of holdover time built with data on more than 152 375 LIWs from 13 countries in five continents covering a time span from 1921 to 2020. This database is the first freely available, harmonized and ready-to-use global source of holdover time data, which may be used in different ways to investigate LIWs and model the holdover phenomenon.

The objective of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal trends of forest cover change and its drivers from 1985 to 2020 in the Cherangany hills forest ecosystem, Kenya. Landsat satellite data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) algorithms were used for land cover mapping and change detection. In addition, a literature review was undertaken to establish the drivers of forest cover change over time in the study area. The results show an overall decline in the forest, water features, and built-up areas land cover categories in the study area while croplands, grasslands, and bareland registered gains. The percentage area under forests declined by about 14.1% (13,782 ha) during the 35 years. This loss translates to an annual average forest loss of 0.40% or 394 ha. Conversely, cropland and grassland registered an increase of about 8.1% (7944 ha) and 5.8% (5616 ha) respectively over the 35-year study period. The drivers of forest cover change in the ecosystem comprised the conversion of forests to croplands and grasslands, grazing, encroachment, illegal logging, firewood harvesting, charcoal production, forest fires, excisions, climate change, population growth, policy, and institutional failures. The findings of this study will help the relevant forest managers re-evaluate the past conservation and management strategies and focus the rehabilitation efforts on the forest ecosystem's degradation hotspots for sustainable forest management.","10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01755","2351-9894","","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION","","","2351-9894",""

Climate change is exerting an increased stress, resulting in a need for improved research methodologies to study their health, composition or evolution. Traditionally, information about forests has been collected using expensive and work-intensive field inventories, but in recent years unoccupied autonomous vehicles (UAVs) have become very popular as they represent a simple and inexpensive way to gather high resolution data of large forested areas. In addition to this trend, deep learning (DL) has also been gaining much attention in the field of forestry as a way to include the knowledge of forestry experts into automatic software pipelines tackling problems such as tree detection or tree health/species classification. Among the many sensors that UAVs can carry, RGB cameras are fast, cost-effective and allow for straightforward data interpretation. This has resulted in a large increase in the amount of UAV-acquired RGB data available for forest studies. In this review, we focus on studies that use DL and RGB images gathered by UAVs to solve practical forestry research problems. We summarize the existing studies, provide a detailed analysis of their strengths paired with a critical assessment on common methodological problems and include other information, such as available public data and code resources that we believe can be useful for researchers that want to start working in this area.

We detected 612 forest fragments, with a percentage of forest cover of 23.01%. Deforestation and forest fires are among the problems identified in the APA, which resulted in the reduction and fragmentation of native forests. Hunting, predatory fishing, improper construction, agriculture and forestry carried out improperly, effluent pollution, species introduction, lack of knowledge of the population about the APA, and scarcity of financial resources are also relevant problems. Among management actions recommended are reforestation, environmental inspection, environmental planning, encouragement of polyculture and agroecological practices, wastewater treatment, dissemination of information about the APA and its potentialities to the population, and use of the amount obtained with Ecological ICMS, environmental compensation, and APA products and services in the management of the protected area.

Purpose: The study synthesizes and compares key environmental legislation concerning protected natural areas (PNAs) and fire management in the nine countries of the Amazon Basin. To this end, the research question asks what directions can be drawn from a visualization and compilation of national regulations for future policy research and practice. Methods and approach: We undertake a critical literature review of PNAs and fire-management policies across the nine countries of the Amazon Basin and their further alignment using analyses of previous policy reviews on forest codes and land distribution. Findings: The article shows the heterogeneity of national fire-use and fire-management policies among the nine countries of the Amazon Basin. In addition, it suggests that top-down policies and regulations are likely to be characterized by misunderstandings (either direct or indirect) of local practice, rationale, and capacity; and, in some cases, risk criminalizing local and indigenous daily subsistence. Policy implications: The study indicates the need for more in-depth research and policy on participatory governance platforms for the use and management of fire, rather than fire-suppression and fire-risk adaptation strategies.

They are persistent priority pollutants and continue to last for a long time in the environment causing severe damage to human health owing to their genotoxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. The study of PAHs in environment has therefore aroused a global concern. PAHs adsorption to plant cell wall is facilitated by transpiration and plant root lipids which help PAHs transfer from roots to leaves and stalks, causing more accumulation of contaminants with the increase in lipid content. Hence, these bioaccumulators can be utilized as biomonitors for indirect assessment of ambient air pollution. Efficacy of specific plants, lichens and mosses as useful biomonitors of airborne PAHs pollution has been discussed in this review along with prevalent classical and modified extraction techniques coupled with proper analytical procedures in order to gain an insight into the assessment of atmospheric PAHs concentrations. Different modern and modified solvent extraction techniques along with conventional Soxhlet method are identified for extraction of PAHs from accumulative bioindicators and analytical methods are also developed for accurate determination of PAHs. Process parameters like choice of solvent, temperature, time of extraction, pressure and matrix characteristics are usually checked. An approach of biomonitoring of PAHs using plants, lichens and mosses has been discussed here as they usually trap the atmospheric PAHs and mineralize them. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It includes numerous case studies on perception and social behavior dealing with floods, droughts, earthquakes, volcano eruptions, wild fires, and landslides. The review reveals that personal experience of a natural hazard and trustor lack of trustin authorities and experts have the most substantial impact on risk perception. Cultural and individual factors such as media coverage, age, gender, education, income, social status, and others do not play such an important role but act as mediators or amplifiers of the main causal connections between experience, trust, perception, and preparedness to take protective actions. When analyzing the factors of experience and trust on risk perception and on the likeliness of individuals to take preparedness action, the review found that a risk perception paradox exists in that it is assumed that high risk perception will lead to personal preparedness and, in the next step, to risk mitigation behavior. However, this is not necessarily true. In fact, the opposite can occur if individuals with high risk perception still choose not to personally prepare themselves in the face of a natural hazard. Therefore, based on the results of the review, this article offers three explanations suggesting why this paradox might occur. These findings have implications for future risk governance and communication as well as for the willingness of individuals to invest in risk preparedness or risk mitigation actions.","10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01942.x","0272-4332 and 1539-6924","","RISK ANALYSIS","6","1049","0272-4332 and 1539-6924",""

In some regions, prescribed fire is being reintroduced to management, often after decades of suppression, and wildfires are increasing in severity and frequency. Local fire regimes play a defining role in structuring faunal diversity and demographic patterns; however, research often focusses on the impacts of fire regimes on species abundance and diversity and there is a dearth in our understanding of the genetic consequences. Our review identified only 37 studies that empirically tested the genetic impacts of fire on fauna, or that attributed genetic patterns to be a consequence of fire regimes. Despite limited empirical research, this review confirms that fire regimes impact the genetic patterns of fauna at an individual, population and meta-population scale. We found that fire regimes may alter an array of genetic patterns by shaping i) natural selection, ii) survival and repopulation strategies, and iii) dispersal. Moreover, we found that anthropogenic interference in fire regimes can impact genetic patterns of fauna, and that changes to the individual characteristics of the fire regime, whether temporal, spatial or intensity related, may have potential genetic consequences. In collating evidence that fire regimes and associated human action can affect genetic patterns of wild populations, this review highlights the need for the further integration of genetic research into the field of fire ecology to help ensure management decisions are well-informed.","10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110169","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","","","0006-3207 and 1873-2917",""

There has been a notable increase in both the frequency and intensity of bushfires, as clearly demonstrated by recent bushfire events. Bushfires are an intricate phenomenon that transpires across various spatial and temporal scales. Further, the changing circumstances of landscapes, vegetation patterns, weather conditions and ecosystems account for the complexity. Therefore, continual attention is essential for the development of bushfire management strategies. In this context, this paper undertakes a comprehensive literature review of bushfire management strategies, encompassing aspects such as bushfire prediction, detection, suppression and prevention. Based on the review, a bushfire management framework is proposed that can eliminate or successfully mitigate the consequences of bushfires. Further, the paper delves into the domains of fire weather conditions, the initiation of bushfires and the adverse consequences stemming from these fires. Both terrestrial and aerial remote sensing methods have proven to be effective in predicting and detecting bushfires. Nevertheless, a simple unique solution cannot be proposed for bushfire management. Changing weather conditions, topography and the geographic mix of asset types need to be considered when deciding on bushfire management strategies and their breadth and depth of application.","10.3390/fire6110421","2571-6255","","FIRE-SWITZERLAND","11","","2571-6255",""

Observations of Delta O-3/Delta CO range from approximately -0.1 to 0.9, and are caused by the interplay of numerous factors including fire emissions, efficiency of combustion, chemical and photochemical reactions, aerosol effects on chemistry and radiation, and local and downwind meteorological patterns. Using average Delta O-3/Delta CO ratios for major biomes, we estimate global wildfires produce approximately 170 Tg of O-3 per year, which is 3.5% of all global tropospheric O-3 production. Areas of uncertainty in wildfire O-3 production include the net effect of aerosols on chemical and photochemical reactions within a fire plume, the impact of oxygenated volatile organic compounds and nitrous acid on O-3 production, and the interplay of variables that lead to extreme Delta O-3/Delta CO values. Because wildfire frequencies are likely increasing and have been shown to contribute to elevated O-3 at air quality monitoring sites, it is important to better understand the emissions, photochemistry and impacts of these fires.

Simultaneously, shifts in fire management approaches have resulted in the development of new policies and vice versa. Originating from diverse fields, the terminology used in research and policy communities is far from consistent, which hinders science-based, up-to-date engagement between wildfire researchers and policymakers. Hence, this study aims to harmonize the terminology on key concepts and establish a typology for systematically classifying all wildfires and management actions observed in the literature. We conducted a scoping literature review and developed a cyclical analytical framework, called the ring-of-fire, drawing on cyclical conceptions of fire management and public policy, respectively. Consequently, we propose criteria for establishing a common dialogue between wildfire actors by providing a system for classifying actions and presenting a reference system for wildfire definitions. Furthermore, we present results by geographical regions regarding fire management actions and discuss the use of the ""fire suppression"" concept given its ambiguity.

This research uses Landsat remote imaging to examine the changing patterns of forests. It focuses on areas which have undergone a high level of a specific fragmentation driver, in particular either agricultural expansion or commodity-driven deforestation. Seven municipalities in the states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso in Brazil are selected as case study areas, as these states experienced a high level of commodity-driven deforestation and agricultural expansion respectively. Land cover maps of each municipality are created using the Geographical Information System software ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension. The resulting categorical maps are input into Fragstats fragmentation software to calculate quantifiable fragmentation metrics for each municipality. To determine the effects that these characteristics are likely to cause, this study uses a literature review to determine how species traits affect their responses to forest fragmentation. Results indicate that, in areas that underwent agricultural expansion, the remaining forest patches became more complex in shape with longer edges and lost a large amount of core area. This negatively affects species which are either highly dispersive or specialist to core forest habitat. In areas that underwent commodity-driven deforestation, it was more likely that forest patches would become less aggregated and create disjunct core areas. This negatively affects smaller, sedentary animals which do not naturally travel long distances. This study is significant in that it links individual fragmentation drivers to their landscape characteristics, and in turn uses these to predict effects on species with particular traits. This information will prove useful for forest managers, particularly in the case study municipalities examined in this study, in deciding which species require further protection measures. The methodology could be applied to other drivers of forest fragmentation such as forest fires.","10.3390/su13063246","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY","6","","2071-1050",""

Thus, the general objective of this paper was to evaluate the potential use of rainwater as a source of water for firefighting. To do so, two approaches were pro-posed for the assessment. The first approach was the analysis of the existing literature. Two databases were evaluated as references in engineering fields, of which 32 articles mentioned rainwater as an alternative for firefighting. The main result of the review was the scarcity of articles in the area under study, with some of the existing articles focusing on forest fires. In contrast, others analysed the use of rainwater within the scope of buildings or fire stations. The sec-ond approach involved a case study that started by analysing the fire statistics provided by the Military Fire Depart-ment of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. It was observed that, between 2017 and 2020, building fires represented 25 % of the state's fires and 50 % of the water consumption in firefighting, while the rest of the fire occurrences rep-resented the other half of water consumption. Rainwater can be used not only to reduce the total consumption of po -table water but also as a logistics tool towards better response time in the event of a fire. With the firefighting water demand obtained, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was performed to assess the potential environmental opti-misation in a simplified scope. It was performed in a cradle-to-gate approach, leaving the potential optimisations in transport and logistics apart. Also, a cost assessment was carried out, obtaining a much lower cost for firefighting and providing financial savings for fire stations. As a result, rainwater is expected to decrease environmental impacts, help logistics in fire and save money for fire supression.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165510","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

We review the potential for this mechanism [reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear-cutting of mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of low-biomass, high-conservation-value ecosystems, and substitution of low-biomass vegetation by monoculture tree plantations. These costs could be avoided through measures that protect low-biomass native ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1) watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat, and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interventions in a large-scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02109.x","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","12","2803","1354-1013 and 1365-2486",""

However, these wildfires also pose a range of social, economic, and environmental risks, with growing concern regarding persistent effects on stream flow volume, seasonal timing of flow, water quality, aquatic ecosystem health, and downstream community drinking water treatment. Here, we present the outcomes of a comprehensive scoping review of post-fire hydrologic studies in high-latitude forests of North America (Canada and Alaska). Our objectives were to (1) create an inventory of studies on post-fire hydrologic effects on surface water; (2) analyze those studies in terms of watershed characteristics and the type and duration of hydrologic effects; (3) identify and evaluate the link between upstream hydrologic effects with hydrologic ecosystem services; and (4) propose a research agenda addressing the link between wildfire science and hydrologic ecosystem services. We screened 2935 peer-reviewed articles and selected 82 studies to include based on their relevance according to a systematic, multi-step selection process. Next, we classified the papers into five themes: (a) runoff volume and flow regimes, (b) erosion and sediment transport, (c) water chemistry, (d) hydromorphology, and (e) aquatic food webs. For each study, we documented location, fire regime, watershed characteristics, and ecosystem services. The annual number of published studies on post-fire hydrology in high-latitude forests and, in particular, those addressing hydrologic ecosystem services, has increased steadily in recent years. Descriptions of wildfire characteristics, watershed characteristics, and effects on hydrologic ecosystem services were highly variable across studies, hindering cross-study comparisons. Moreover, there were limited efforts to extend study results to implications for forest or water management decisions regarding ecosystem services from source watersheds. Most studies focused on fire impacts on aquatic habitats and water chemistry while services of direct concern to communities, such as drinking water, were rarely addressed. We contend that study standardization, further use of geospatial technologies, and more studies directly addressing ecosystem services will help mitigate the increasing risks to water resources in northern forests.","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124360","0022-1694 and 1879-2707","","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","","","0022-1694 and 1879-2707",""

While many studies have documented the physical health harms of wildfire smoke, less is known about the effects on mental health and well-being. Understanding the effects of wildfire smoke on mental health and well-being is crucial as the world enters a time in which wildfire smoke events become more frequent and severe. We conducted a scoping review of the existing information on wildfire smoke's impact on mental health and well-being and developed a model for understanding the pathways in which wildfire smoke may contribute to mental health distress. Methods: We conducted searches using PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google, Scopus, and ProQuest for 1990-2022. These searches yielded 200 articles. Sixteen publications met inclusion criteria following screening and eligibility assessment. Three more publications from the bibliographies of these articles were included for a total of 19 publications. Results: Our review suggests that exposure to wildfire smoke may have mental health impacts, particularly in episodes of chronic and persistent smoke events, but the evidence is inconsistent and limited. Qualitative studies disclose a wider range of impacts across multiple mental health and well-being domains. The potential pathways connecting wildfire smoke with mental health and well-being operate at multiple interacting levels including individual, social and community networks, living and working conditions, and ecological levels. Conclusions: Priorities for future research include: 1) applying more rigorous methods; 2) differentiating between mental illness and emotional well-being; 3) studying chronic, persistent or repeated smoke events; 4) identifying the contextual factors that set the stage for mental health and well-being effects, and 5) identifying the causal processes that link wildfire smoke to mental health and well-being effects. The pathways model can serve as a basis for further research and knowledge synthesis on this topic. Also, it helps public health, community mental health, and emergency management practitioners mitigate the mental health and well-being harms of wildfire smoke.","10.1186/s12889-022-14662-z","1471-2458","","BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","1","","1471-2458",""

Actually, it is not easy to generate more returns, in this sector, for the land owners, in addition to the production of wood after several years, depending on the produced species. In general, these difficulties lead to the land abandonment and a large set of associated problems like the forest fires. The main objective of this research is therefore to highlight the main insights from the literature related with the forest entrepreneurship, as supports for the several stakeholders, namely the policymakers, stressing the main gaps in the current scientific literature. In this paper, we have developed a bibliometric analysis through the VOSviewer software, complemented with a literature review, considering 83 articles obtained from the Web of Science (core collection) and Scopus related with the topic of 'forest' and 'entrepreneurship'. We detailed the networks of Journals, Countries, Terms and Authors that have been researching and publishing in the scientific domains of 'forest entrepreneurship'. Additionally, we studied measures of social networks analysis for each case. This kind of analysis for these topics has a particular novelty, because there is still a significant scarcity of studies addressing these approaches. In fact, searching, for example, in WOS (all databases) for the topics 'forest', 'entrepreneurship' and 'bibliometric' we found zero documents (the same for Scopus platform, considering the article title, abstract and keywords). We concluded that the recent field of 'forest entrepreneurship' has allowed a higher level of co-authorships and a lower level of centrality in the citations' network. We identified, also, that there are some gaps in the scientific literature, namely related with the few multidisciplinary networks outside the forest sciences in these topics. Finally, we observed that these topics are related with authors who, on average, published with 9 co-authors along their career and that authors working on the most generic topic of 'forest' tend to have 17 different co-authors, reinforcing the characteristics of 'forestry entrepreneurship' as a relevant but emerging scientific field.

Several approaches have been applied in previous studies; however, the concepts and interpretations of these approaches are poorly understood. In this scoping review, we addressed issues related to the application of epidemiology (EPI), health burden estimation (HBE), and health risk assessment (HRA) approaches, and discussed the interpretation of findings, and current research gaps. Most studies reported an air quality index exceeding the 'unhealthy' level, especially during smoke haze periods. Although smoke haze is a regional issue in Southeast Asia, studies on its related health effects have only been reported from several countries in the region. Each approach revealed increased health effects in a distinct manner: EPI studies reported excess mortality and morbidity during smoke haze compared to non-smoke haze periods; HBE studies estimated approximately 100,000 deaths attributable to smoke haze in the entire Southeast Asia considering allcause mortality and all age groups, which ranged from 1,064-260,000 for specified mortality cause, age group, study area, and study period; HRA studies quantified potential lifetime cancer and non-cancer risks due to exposure to smoke-related chemicals. Currently, there is a lack of interconnection between these three approaches. The EPI approach requires extensive effort to investigate lifetime health effects, whereas the HRA approach needs to clarify the assumptions in exposure assessments to estimate lifetime health risks. The HBE approach allows the presentation of health impact in different scenarios, however, the risk functions used are derived from EPI studies from other regions. Two recent studies applied a combination of the EPI and HBE approaches to address uncertainty issues due to the selection of risk functions. In conclusion, all approaches revealed potential health risks due to smoke haze. Nonetheless, future studies should consider comparable exposure assessments to allow the integration of the three approaches.","10.1371/journal.pone.0274433","1932-6203","","PLOS ONE","9","","1932-6203",""

Drainage and burning of tropical peatlands releases about 5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet there is great uncertainty in these estimates. Our comprehensive literature review of parameters required to calculate GHG emissions from burnt peat forests, following the international guidelines, revealed many gaps in knowledge of carbon pools and few recent supporting studies. To improve future estimates of the total ecosystem carbon balance and peatfire emissions this study aimed to account for all carbon pools: aboveground, deadwood, pyrogenic carbon (PyC) and peat of single and repeatedly burnt peat forests. A further aim was to identify the minimum sampling intensity required to detect with 80% power significant differences in these carbon pools among long unburnt, recently burnt and repeatedly burnt peat swamp forests. About 90 Mg C ha(-1) remains aboveground as deadwood after a single fire and half of this remains after a second fire. One fire produces 4.5 +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) of PyC, with a second fire increasing this to 7.1 +/- 0.8 Mg C ha(-1). For peat swamp forests these aboveground carbon pools are rarely accounted in estimates of emissions following multiple fires, while PyC has not been included in the total peat carbon mass balance. Peat bulk density and peat carbon content change with fire frequency, yet these parameters often remain constant in the published emission estimates following a single and multiple fires. Our power analysis indicated that as few as 12 plots are required to detect meaningful differences between fire treatments for the major carbon pools. Further field studies directed at improving the parameters for calculating carbon balance of disturbed peat forest ecosystems are required to better constrain peatfire GHG emission estimates.

Under uncertain climate change conditions, these areas require new adaptive strategies to support landscape and community resilience. While these areas vary widely, some patterns of local social context have become apparent through wildland fire research. These patterns can help decision-makers better understand what influences communities' abilities to adapt to fire. We focused our study on a northwestern European Mediterranean context, where communities are adapting to wildland fire and other climate change impacts through varied programs and policies. This area is composed of diverse landscapes, cultures, histories, languages and governance structures, but it also shares fire-based learning networks and collaborations, providing a sound indicator of shared elements of social context. Our study analyzed local social contexts in rural areas of Spain, Italy and France and assessed how these may inform adaptive capacity to wildland fire. A two-step process achieved this: (1) a targeted literature review of local social context elements as they relate to wildland fire in Mediterranean Europe; and (2) conducting semi-structured interviews with 20 key experts in rural Mediterranean areas, including fire managers, foresters, local administrators and technicians.ResultsResults illustrate numerous shared patterns in rural social contexts that influence local fire adaptive capacity. Dynamic local relationships among residents, local fire knowledge and environmental movements, the role of fire managers and administrators, and embeddedness in broader sociopolitical trends all interconnect to influence local fire adaptive capacity. Some key elements of context can act as primary enablers or barriers to this process, such as the presence (or lack) of local fire knowledge, and the opportunity (or lack thereof) for sustainable local economic development. Results also demonstrate high diversity in terms of governance structures and development trajectories.ConclusionsWe argue the need for deepened empirical transdisciplinary research to connect fire and land management tailored to local characteristics. Centering these local perspectives and diverse cultural values is necessary to foster long term adaptive wildland fire management strategies in rural Mediterranean communities and globally.","10.1186/s42408-023-00168-5","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","1","","1933-9747",""

The results reveal that airborne ethylene concentrations at the ppb levels are commonplace and can arise in the vicinity of traffic corridors, forest fires, indoor kitchens, horticultural areas, oil fields, house fires, and petrochemical sites. The primary biogenic sources of ethylene derive from microbial activity in most soil and marine environments as well as its biological formation in wide variety of plant species. Sizable amounts of ethylene can also result from the burning of fossil fuels, forest and savanna fires, and crop residue combustion. Motor vehicle exhaust is the largest contributor to urban ethylene levels under most circumstances, but industrial flare releases and fugitive emissions may also be of relevance. Occupational exposures generally range up to about 50-100 ppm and have been documented for those working in the horticultural, petrochemical, and fire and rescue industries. Continuous personal monitoring at the community level has documented exposures of 3-4 ppb. These levels are more closely associated with the ethylene concentrations found indoors rather than outdoors indicating the importance of exposure sources found within the home. Indoor air sources of ethylene are associated with environmental tobacco smoke, wood or propane fuel use, fruit and vegetable storage, and cooking. Ethylene is not found in any consumer or commercial products and does not off-gas from building products to any appreciable extent. The review indicates that outdoor sources located some distance from the home do not make an appreciable contribution to personal exposures given the strength and variety of sources found in the immediate living environment.

Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods - including deep learning and agent-based learning - in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire research and management communities play an active role in providing relevant, high-quality, and freely available wildfire data for use by practitioners of ML methods.","10.1139/er-2020-0019","1208-6053 and 1181-8700","","ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS","4","478","1208-6053 and 1181-8700",""

It may be linked to the increase in atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), leading to a rise in sea level, notable shifts in ecosystems, and in the frequency and intensity of wild fires. There is a strong interest in stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and other GHGs by decreasing carbon emission and/or increasing carbon sequestration. Biotic sequestration is an important and effective strategy to mitigate the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations by increasing carbon sequestration and storage capacity of ecosystems using plant photosynthesis and by decreasing carbon emission using biofuel rather than fossil fuel. Improvement of photosynthetic carbon assimilation, using transgenic engineering, potentially provides a set of available and effective tools for enhancing plant carbon sequestration. In this review, firstly different biological methods of CO2 assimilation in C-3, C-4 and CAM plants are introduced and three types of C-4 pathways which have high photosynthetic performance and have evolved as CO2 pumps are briefly summarized. Then (i) the improvement of photosynthetic carbon assimilation of C-3 plants by transgenic engineering using non-C-4 genes, and (ii) the overexpression of individual or multiple C-4 cycle photosynthetic genes (PEPC, PPDK, PCK, NADP-ME and NADP-MDH) in transgenic C-3 plants (e. g. tobacco, potato, rice and Arabidopsis) are highlighted. Some transgenic C-3 plants (e. g. tobacco, rice and Arabidopsis) overexpressing the FBP/SBPase, ictB and cytochrome C-6 genes showed positive effects on photosynthetic efficiency and growth characteristics. However, over the last 28 years, efforts to overexpress individual, double or multiple C-4 enzymes in C-3 plants like tobacco, potato, rice, and Arabidopsis have produced mixed results that do not confirm or eliminate the possibility of improving photosynthesis of C-3 plants by this approach. Finally, a prospect is provided on the challenges of enhancing carbon assimilation of C-3 plants using transgenic engineering in the face of global warming, and the trends of the most promising approaches to improving the photosynthetic performance of C-3 plants.","10.3109/07388551.2010.533119","0738-8551 and 1549-7801","","CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY","1","1","0738-8551 and 1549-7801",""

Given projected climate change, tree regeneration declines and ecosystem shifts following severe wildfires are predicted. We reviewed scientific literature on post-fire tree regeneration to understand where and why no or few trees established. We wished to distinguish sites that won't regenerate to trees because of changing climate from sites where trees could grow post fire if they had a seed source or were planted, thus supporting forest ecosystem services for society and nature, such as timber supply, habitat, watershed protection, and carbon storage. Results: Our literature review showed that little to no post-fire tree regeneration was more common in low-elevation, dry forest types than in high-elevation forest types. However, depending on the region and species, low tree regeneration was also observed in high elevation, moist forests. Regeneration densities varied by species and seedling densities were attributed to distances to a seed source, water stress or precipitation, elevation, slope, aspect, and plant competition. Our findings provide land managers with two primary considerations to offset low tree regeneration densities. First, we supply a decision support tool of where to plant tree seedling in large high severity burned patches. Second, we recommend possibilities for mitigating and limiting large high severity burned patches to increase survival of trees to be sources of seed for natural regeneration. Conclusions: Few or no tree seedlings are establishing on some areas of the 150+ forest fires sampled across western US, suggesting that forests may be replaced by shrublands and grasslands, especially where few seed source trees survived the wildfires. Key information gaps on how species will respond to continued climate change, repeated disturbances, and other site factors following wildfires currently limit our ability to determine future trends in forest regeneration. We provide a decision tree to assist managers in prioritizing post-fire reforestation. We emphasize prioritizing the interior of large burned patches and considering current and future climate in deciding what, when, and where to plant trees. Finally, managing fires and forests for more seed-source tree survival will reduce large, non-forested areas following wildfires where post-fire management may be necessary.","10.1186/s42408-019-0032-1","1933-9747","","FIRE ECOLOGY","","","1933-9747",""

Combustion, in presence of a chlorine donor, seems to be a major source of these compounds. High levels of dioxins are also emitted from metallurgical industries including copper smelters, electric furnaces in steel mills, and wire reclamation incinerators. Trace levels are detectable in emissions from motor vehicles using leaded gasoline or diesel fuel, in forest fires, and in residential wood burning. Extremely persistent and widely distributed in the environment, PCDDs have been detected in all three primary and many secondary media. Releases into the air occur mainly from combustor emissions. Atmospheric dispersion, deposition, and subsequent accumulation in the food chain seem to be the major pathways of exposure to the general population. Residues of these chemicals have been detected in soil, sediment, fish, meat, cow's milk, human adipose tissue, and mothers' milk. In general, these chemicals have high lipophilicity. The elimination half-life of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in humans is approximately 7-11 years. Very little human toxicity data from exposure to PCDDs are available. Health-effect data obtained from occupational settings in humans are based on exposure to chemicals contaminated with TCDD. It produces a spectrum of toxic effects in animals and is one of the most toxic chemicals known. Most of the toxicity data available on TCDD are from high-dose oral exposures to animals. Very few percutaneous and no inhalation exposure data are available in the literature. There is a wide range of difference in sensitivity to PCDD lethality in animals. The signs and symptoms of poisoning with chemicals contaminated with TCDD in humans are analogous to those observed in animals. Dioxin exposures to humans are associated with increased risk of severe skin lesions such as chloracne and hyperpigmentation, altered liver function and lipid metabolism, general weakness associated with drastic weight loss, changes in activities of various liver enzymes, depression of the immune system, and endocrine-and nervous-system abnormalities. It is a potent teratogenic and fetotoxic chemical in animals. A very potent promoter in rat Liver carcinogenesis, TCDD also causes cancers of the liver and other organs in animals. Populations occupationally or accidentally exposed to chemicals contaminated with dioxin have increased incidences of soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. No comprehensive studies have been conducted to determine any health impact to the general population from environmental exposure to PCDDs. This paper presents a brief review of relevant animal and human data for projecting any possible health effects from environmental exposures to PCDDs.","10.1080/10473289.1998.10463655","1096-2247 and 2162-2906","","JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION","2","157","1096-2247 and 2162-2906",""

The mining and processing of bitumen to produce synthetic crude oil, and the waste products associated with this activity, lead to significant emissions of gaseous and particle air pollutants. Deposition of pollutants occurs locally (i.e., near the sources) and also potentially at distances downwind, depending upon each pollutant's chemical and physical properties and meteorological conditions. The Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSM) was initiated in 2012 by the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta to enhance or improve monitoring of pollutants and their potential impacts. In support of JOSM, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) undertook a significant research effort via three components: the Air, Water, and Wildlife components, which were implemented to better estimate baseline conditions related to levels of pollutants in the air and water, amounts of deposition, and exposures experienced by the biota. The criteria air contaminants (e.g., nitrogen oxides [NOx], sulfur dioxide [SO2], volatile organic compounds [VOCs], particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 m [PM2.5]) and their secondary atmospheric products were of interest, as well as toxic compounds, particularly polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), trace metals, and mercury (Hg). This critical review discusses the challenges of assessing ecosystem impacts and summarizes the major results of these efforts through approximately 2018. Focus is on the emissions to the air and the findings from the Air Component of the ECCC research and linkages to observations of contaminant levels in the surface waters in the region, in aquatic species, as well as in terrestrial and avian species. The existing evidence of impact on these species is briefly discussed, as is the potential for some of them to serve as sentinel species for the ongoing monitoring needed to better understand potential effects, their potential causes, and to detect future changes. Quantification of the atmospheric emissions of multiple pollutants needs to be improved, as does an understanding of the processes influencing fugitive emissions and local and regional deposition patterns. The influence of multiple stressors on biota exposure and response, from natural bitumen and forest fires to climate change, complicates the current ability to attribute effects to air emissions from the industry. However, there is growing evidence of the impact of current levels of PACs on some species, pointing to the need to improve the ability to predict PAC exposures and the key emission source involved. Although this critical review attempts to integrate some of the findings across the components, in terms of ECCC activities, increased coordination or integration of air, water, and wildlife research would enhance deeper scientific understanding. Improved understanding is needed in order to guide the development of long-term monitoring strategies that could most efficiently inform a future adaptive management approach to oil sands environmental monitoring and prevention of impacts.Implications: Quantification of atmospheric emissions for multiple pollutants needs to be improved, and reporting mechanisms and standards could be adapted to facilitate such improvements, including periodic validation, particularly where uncertainties are the largest. Understanding of baseline conditions in the air, water and biota has improved significantly; ongoing enhanced monitoring, building on this progress, will help improve ecosystem protection measures in the oil sands region. Sentinel species have been identified that could be used to identify and characterize potential impacts of wildlife exposure, both locally and regionally. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are identified as having an impact on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife at current concentration levels although the significance of these impacts and attribution to emissions from oil sands development requires further assessment. Given the improvement in high resolution air quality prediction models, these should be a valuable tool to future environmental assessments and cumulative environment impact assessments.","10.1080/10962247.2019.1607689","1096-2247 and 2162-2906","","JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION","6","661","1096-2247 and 2162-2906",""

We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities-assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)).

The objectives of this review of academic and grey literature were to: Identify the impact of occupational exposure to wildland fires on physical, mental, and emotional health; and Examine the characteristics and effectiveness of prevention, mitigation, or management strategies studied to reduce negative health outcomes associated with occupational exposure to wildland fire. Methods Following established scoping review methods, academic literature as well as government and industry reports were identified by searching seven academic databases and through a targeted grey literature search. 4679 articles were screened using pre-determined eligibility criteria. Data on study characteristics, health outcomes assessed, prevention or mitigation strategies studied, and main findings were extracted from each included document. The results of this scoping review are presented using descriptive tables and a narrative summary to organize key findings. Results The final sample was comprised of 100 articles: 76 research articles and 24 grey literature reports. Grey literature focused on acute injuries and fatalities. Health outcomes reported in academic studies focused on respiratory health (n = 14), mental health (n = 16), and inflammation and oxidative stress (n = 12). The identified studies evaluated short-term outcomes measuring changes across a single shift or wildland fire season. Most research was conducted with wildland firefighters and excluded personnel such as aviation crews, contract crews, and incident management teams. Five articles reported direct study of mitigation strategies, focusing on the potential usage of masks, advanced hygiene protocols to reduce exposure, fluid intake to manage hydration and core temperature, and glutamine supplementation to reduce fatigue. Conclusions While broad in scope, the evidence base linking wildland fire exposure to any one health outcome is limited. The lack of long-term evidence on changes in health status or morbidity is a clear evidence gap and there is a need to prioritize research on the mental and physical health impact of occupational exposure to wildland fire.","10.1186/s12995-021-00328-w","1745-6673","","JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY","1","","1745-6673",""

Forest -based climate change mitigation strategies, such as afforestation, reforestation, and sustainable forest management, offer promising solutions to mitigate climate change and simultaneously yield substantial co -benefits for human health. The objective of this scoping review was to examine research trends related to the interdisciplinary nexus between forests as carbon sinks and human health co -benefits. We developed a conceptual framework model, supporting the inclusion of exposure pathways, such as recreational opportunities or aesthetic experiences, in the co -benefit context. We used a scoping review methodology to identify the proportion of European research on forest -based mitigation strategies that acknowledge the interconnection between mitigation strategies and human impacts. We also aimed to assess whether synergies and trade-offs between forest -based carbon sink capacity and human co -benefits has been analysed and quantified. From the initial 4,062 records retrieved, 349 reports analysed European forest management principles and factors related to climate change mitigation capacity. Of those, 97 studies acknowledged human co -benefits and 13 studies quantified the impacts on exposure pathways or health co -benefits and were included for full review. Our analysis demonstrates that there is potential for synergies related to optimising carbon sink capacity together with human co -benefits, but there is currently a lack of holistic research approaches assessing these interrelationships.

EWEs hold the potential to harm sexual health through pathways including elevated exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), disrupted healthcare access, and increased sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The WHO defines four components of sexual health: comprehensive sexuality education; HIV and STI prevention and care; SGBV prevention and care; and psychosexual counselling. Yet, knowledge gaps remain regarding climate change and its associations with these sexual health domains. This scoping review will therefore explore the linkages between climate change and sexual health. Methods and analysis Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL) will be searched using text words and subject headings (eg, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Emtree) related to sexual health and climate change from the inception of each database to May 2021. Grey literature and unpublished reports will be searched using a comprehensive search strategy, including from the WHO, World Bank eLibrary, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The scoping review will consider studies that explore: (a) climate change and EWEs including droughts, heat waves, wildfires, dust storms, hurricanes, flooding rains, coastal flooding and storm surges; alongside (b) sexual health, including: comprehensive sexual health education, sexual health counselling, and HIV/STI acquisition, prevention and/or care, and/or SGBV, including intimate partner violence, sexual assault and rape.

The priority forest management issues affecting family owned forests, identified for the state of Oregon by the Oregon Department of Forestry (the primary state forestry agency), help to inform educational programs. In addition, these issues often inform the content for landowner support through cost-share and technical assistance programs, which may or may not address landowner needs. We prioritized the following five priorities for family forests in Oregon: climate change, wildfire, ecosystem services, legacy (generational succession of land), and forest health (insects and diseases). We undertook a scoping review of the recent literature (2000-2018) to determine the degree to which researchers were focusing on these issues in the state as well as a web-based survey of family forest and woodland owner educational service providers to determine if outreach programs were targeting these priorities. From a total of 52 papers identified, 19 met the search criteria for inclusion. Two papers focused on climate change, one on forest health, ten on ecosystem services, eight on wildfire, and none on legacy. Scoping review results indicate that the priority issues explored in this study are addressed in literature focusing on family forestland owners in Oregon, albeit some issues more in depth than others, with forest legacy not being addressed at all. Our survey results indicate that the five priority issues seem to align among the state, educators, and landowners, and that educational opportunities are being provided for all issues to some extent. However, there is a need for a more focused allocation of resources to address some of the knowledge gaps and discrepancies identified here.","10.1007/s11842-019-09426-4","1873-7617 and 1873-7854","","SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY","4","411","1873-7617 and 1873-7854",""

The literature reviewed suggests that, despite progress, there are still a range of barriers that leave little scope for Indigenous participation in shaping wildfire management on their territories. The literature also illustrates that the evacu-ation process can be traumatic and, at times, more harmful than the risk posed by the wildfire itself. However, the challenge is deeper than government agencies and external support organi-zations needing to improve their acceptance and utilization of Indigenous experiences and knowledges, identify opportunities for effective partnerships between government and Indige-nous communities and organizations, and provide adequate funding and resources. More so, the challenge relates to the need to make space for Indigenous people's self-determination, with more agency and control over key aspects of wildfire management and evacuation. Some of the most promising examples from the literature were situations in which Indigenous communities took initiative on their own, had more control over decisions, or were otherwise enabled to express their collective agency in both wildfire management and evacuation.

Working at the intersection of natural resource management and emergency response, wildland firefighters have multidimensional careers that often incorporate elements from disparate fields to accomplish the tasks of suppressing and preventing wildfires. Thus, they have distinctly different job duties than other firefighters (e.g., structural firefighters) and experience environmental health risks that are unique to their work. We conducted a systematic scoping review of scientific literature that addresses wildland firefighter environmental health. Our goal was to identify studies that specifically addressed wildland firefighters (as opposed to firefighters in a broader sense), geographic and demographic trends, sample sizes, patterns in analysis, and common categories of research.

Adverse mental health outcomes were identified resulting from flood (n = 4), drought (n = 4), extreme heat (n = 1), bushfire (n = 1), and multiple events (n = 2). Findings included pathological outcomes with predictable symptomatology including mood disorders; trauma-and stressor-related disorders; and suicide. Additionally, conditions indicating psychological distress which were below the pathological threshold including emotion regulation difficulties, disturbed sleep, alcohol use, stress, and anxiety. The quantitative evidence for the association between extreme weather events and mental health was limited primar-ily by a lack of longitudinal data, exposure gradient, and comparison to an unaffected group, as well as a failure to pro-vide an objective exposure measure. The qualitative evidence for this association was complimentary but without sufficient clinical measurement these outcomes cannot be verified as psychological morbidities. In addition, this re-view provided insight into the mental health of vulnerable communities affected by extreme weather events including those living in poverty, farmers, pastoralists, women, and children.Conclusion: This review provided some preliminary evidence for the association between extreme weather events and adverse mental health outcomes for populations in Africa. The review also provides insight to vulnerable populations affected by extreme weather events. Future research with stronger designs and methodologies are recommended.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163420","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

Wearable electronic devices (wearables) present a potential solution to this research gap. Wearables have become widely accepted in various areas of health research for ecological momentary assessment, and some studies have used wearables in the field of climate change and health. However, these studies vary in study design, demographics, and outcome variables, and existing research has not been mapped.Objective: In this review, we aimed to map existing research on wearables used to detect direct health impacts and individual exposure during climate change-induced weather extremes, such as heat waves or wildfires. Methods: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework and systematically searched 6 databases (PubMed [MEDLINE], IEEE Xplore, CINAHL [EBSCOhost], WoS, Scopus, Ovid [MEDLINE], and Google Scholar). The search yielded 1871 results. Abstracts and full texts were screened by 2 reviewers (MK and IM) independently using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria comprised studies published since 2010 that used off-the-shelf wearables that were neither invasive nor obtrusive to the user in the setting of climate change-related weather extremes. Data were charted using a structured form, and the study outcomes were narratively synthesized.Results: The review included 55,284 study participants using wearables in 53 studies. Most studies were conducted in upper-middle-income and high-income countries (50/53, 94%) in urban environments (25/53, 47%) or in a climatic chamber (19/53, 36%) and assessed the health effects of heat exposure (52/53, 98%). The majority reported adverse health effects of heat exposure on sleep, physical activity, and heart rate. The remaining studies assessed occupational heat stress or compared individual -and area-level heat exposure. In total, 26% (14/53) of studies determined that all examined wearables were valid and reliable for measuring health parameters during heat exposure when compared with standard methods.Conclusions: Wearables have been used successfully in large-scale research to measure the health implications of climate change-related weather extremes. More research is needed in low-income countries and vulnerable populations with pre-existing conditions. In addition, further research could focus on the health impacts of other climate change-related conditions and the effectiveness of adaptation measures at the individual level to such weather extremes.","10.2196/39532","2291-5222","","JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH","9","","2291-5222",""

Officially, the Russian government argues that, as a major exporter of hydrocarbons, Russia benefits from maintaining global reliance on fossil fuels and from climate change itself, because warming may increase the extent and quality of its arable land, open a new year-round Arctic sea route, and make its harsh climate more livable.

In order to aid in their management and mitigate their impact, efforts have been directed towards developing decision support systems that can predict wildfire propagation. Most of the available tools for wildfire spread prediction are based on the Rothermel model that, apart from being relatively complex and computing demanding, depends on several input parameters concerning the local fuels, wind or topography, which are difficult to obtain with a minimum resolution and degree of accuracy. These factors are leading causes for the deviations between the predicted fire propagation and the real fire propagation. In this sense, this paper conducts a literature review on optimization methodologies for wildfire spread prediction based on the use of evolutionary algorithms for input parameter set calibration. In the present literature review, it was observed that the current literature on wildfire spread prediction calibration is mostly focused on methodologies based on genetic algorithms (GAs). Inline with this trend, this paper presents an application of genetic algorithms for the calibration of a set of the Rothermel model's input parameters, namely: surface-area-to-volume ratio, fuel bed depth, fuel moisture, and midflame wind speed. The GA was validated on 37 real datasets obtained through experimental prescribed fires in controlled conditions.","10.3390/math10030300","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS","3","","2227-7390",""

From designing and operating industrial biomass conversion systems to modeling the spread of wildfires, an understanding of solid state pyrolysis kinetics is imperative. A critical review of kinetic models and mathematical approximations currently employed in solid state thermal analysis is provided. Isoconversional and model-fitting methods for estimating kinetic parameters are comparatively evaluated. The thermal decomposition of biomass proceeds via a very complex set of competitive and concurrent reactions and thus the exact mechanism for biomass pyrolysis remains a mystery. The pernicious persistence of substantial variations in kinetic rate data for solids irrespective of the kinetic model employed has exposed serious divisions within the thermal analysis community and also caused the broader scientific and industrial community to question the relevancy and applicability of all kinetic data obtained from heterogeneous reactions. Many factors can influence the kinetic parameters, including process conditions, heat and mass transfer limitations, physical and chemical heterogeneity of the sample, and systematic errors. An analysis of thermal decomposition data obtained from two agricultural residues, nutshells and sugarcane bagasse, reveals the inherent difficulty and risks involved in modeling heterogeneous reaction systems.

As a result, extreme fire conditions will increase, with consequences for wildlife, including increased mass mortality and changes in trophic relationships in natural communities. This intensification is expected to be particularly pronounced in the Mediterranean ecosystems. In this scoping review, we summarized current knowledge and gaps in understanding the effects of fires on wildlife, focusing on predator-prey interactions. These interactions play a critical role in animal communities and their understanding is fundamental for appropriate management and conservation. Mammals were chosen as a model group because of their remarkable ecological role. We grouped and analysed the post-wildfire changes in the predator-prey relationships into three-time intervals: immediate, short- and long-term effects. This is relevant as vegetation restoration, by altering cover and habitat structure, may affect hunting strategies and anti-predatory behaviour. Our review showed that studies generally had several limitations, the most common of which were the lack of replication, the strong geographical bias, and the focus on few target species. Nevertheless, we could formally describe how fire affects predator-prey relationships in Mediterranean ecosystems through processes that exert different cascading effects at different times after the fire event. We encourage long-term studies on communities, including as many components of the food chain as possible, using an interdisciplinary approach, and prioritising investigations in high-risk ecosystems.","10.1007/s42991-024-00439-x","1616-5047 and 1618-1476","","MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY","","","1616-5047 and 1618-1476",""

Many insect groups decline markedly immediately after fire, with the magnitude of reduction related to the degree of exposure to the flames and mobility of the insect. Niche diversity is lower in recently burned habitat, and the rate of insect increase following fire also relates to the species' ability to gain access to the regrowing vegetation. Postburn flora can be quite attractive to some recolonizing insects, possibly to some degree a result of fire-caused insect mortality which provides plants with short-term release from insect herbivory. Insect declines may follow immediately after mowing, but usually of lesser degree and shorter duration than after a fire of comparable timing and size. Season and scale of cutting may affect how much and which species showed positive or negative responses. Cut areas offer the vegetational structure and composition preferred by some insects, but cutting - or cutting at certain scales, seasons, or frequencies - may also be unfavorable for some species. Heavy grazing results in niche and assemblage simplification. Nonetheless, some invertebrates prefer the short turfs and bare ground resulting from heavier grazing. Other species vary in whether they peak in abundance and diversity in intermediate, light, or no grazing. In comparisons of mowing/haying and grazing regimes of similar compatibility with maintenance of the same habitat types, responses of particular species and species groups varied as to whether they had a preference for one or the other. Characteristics associated with insect responses to fire related to the degree of exposure to lethal temperature and stress experienced in the post-fire environment, suitability of post-treatment vegetation as habitat, and ability to rebuild numbers in the site (from survivors and/or colonizers). These factors appear equally useful for explicating insect responses to other managements such as haying, mowing, and grazing. By contrast, the assumption that the most habitat-restricted species will be most adapted to ecological forces believed to be prevalent in that ecosystem appears less efficacious for predicting insect management preferences.","10.1023/A:1016683807033","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","7","1141","0960-3115 and 1572-9710",""

Evidence of the effect of climate variables such as temperate and rainfall on water quality can generate insights into the likely impact of future climate change. While the seasonal effects on water quality are known, and there is strong qualitative evidence that climate change will impact water quality, there are no reviews that synthesise quantitative evidence from LMICs on links between climate variables and water quality. We mapped the available evidence on a range of climate exposures and water quality outcomes and identified 98 peer-reviewed studies. This included observational studies on the impact of temperature and rainfall events (which may cause short-term changes in contaminant concentrations), and modelling studies on the long-term impacts of sea level rise. Evidence on links between antecedent rainfall and microbiological contamination of water supplies is strong and relatively evenly distributed geographically, but largely focused on faecal indicator bacteria and on untreated shallow groundwater sources of drinking water. The literature on climate effects on geogenic contaminants was sparse. There is substantial research on the links between water temperature and cyanobacteria blooms in surface waters, although most studies were from two countries and did not examine potential effects on water treatment. Similarly, studies modelling the impact of sea level rise on groundwater salinity, mostly from south-Asia and the Middle East, did not discuss challenges for drinking water supplies. We identified key future research priorities based on this review. These include: more studies on specific pathogens (including opportunistic pathogens) in water supplies and their relationships with climate variables; more studies that assess likely relationships between climate variables and water treatment processes; studies into the relationships between climate variables and geogenic contaminants, including risks from heavy metals released as glacier retreat; and, research into the impacts of wildfires on water quality in LMICs given the current dearth of studies but recognised importance.","10.1016/j.watres.2021.117996","0043-1354 and 1879-2448","","WATER RESEARCH","","","0043-1354 and 1879-2448",""

The creation of credible and effective evacuation models is needed within the fire safety engineering community to help address this challenge. Although potentially difficult to represent, a critical component in developing such models is the consideration of what people will do in response to a WUI fire. In this literature review, research relating to WUI fire evacuations was collected to identify the factors that influence protective action decision-making and response during these events, specifically whether someone chooses to evacuate or not. To supplement the findings, related hurricane evacuation literature was also reviewed for such factors. The factors that were identified relate to sociodemographic factors, social and environmental cues, preparation and experience, familial responsibilities, location, and credible threat and risk assessment. These factors were organized according to the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) to create a conceptual model of protective action decision-making. This is the first step in being able to incorporate such factors and their corresponding impact on public response into comprehensive WUI evacuation models.","10.1007/s10694-019-00821-z","0015-2684 and 1572-8099","","FIRE TECHNOLOGY","5","1619","0015-2684 and 1572-8099",""

Based on a survey of the literature, we find that the hot plate method has advantages over alternatives when looking at the specific niche of small-to-intermediate live fuel samples-a size range not addressed in most studies. In addition, we directly compare the hot plate method to the commonly used epiradiator design by simultaneously conducting flammability tests along a moisture gradient, established with a laboratory benchtop drydown. Our design comparison addresses two basic issues: (1) the relationship between hydration and flammability and (2) relationships between flammability metrics.

However, duplication of environmental and thermal characteristics among monitoring sites means many networks have lower than expected statistical power.

A literature review identified processes controlling stream temperature and associated landscape controls. Metrics indicative of these landscape controls were calculated for points every 500 m along the river network. From these points, sites were chosen to cover the full range of observed environmental gradients and combinations of controlling variables. The resulting network contains sites with unique characteristics covering the range of relevant environmental characteristics observed in Scottish salmon rivers. The network will thus have minimal redundancy, often not seen in large networks, and high statistical power to separate the relative importance of predictor variables thereby allowing large-scale water temperature predictions.","10.2166/nh.2015.106","1998-9563 and 2224-7955","","HYDROLOGY RESEARCH","3","569","1998-9563 and 2224-7955",""

Study design: Literature review completed using rapid realist review methods, and taking into consideration the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses) statement for systematic reviews. Data sources: We sourced data from six databases: EBSCOhost (Education), EBSCOhost (Health), EBSCOhost (Psychology), Informit, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We developed search terms to identify articles that could address the research question based on the inclusion criteria of peer reviewed full text journal articles published in English between 1983 and 2020. We initially identified 60 studies and, following closer review, extracted data from eight studies that met the inclusion criteria. Data synthesis: Children exposed to bushfires may be at increased risk of poorer wellbeing outcomes. Findings suggest that the impact of bushfire exposure may not be apparent in the short term but may become more pronounced later in life. Children particularly at risk are those from more vulnerable backgrounds who may have compounding factors that limit their ability to overcome bushfire trauma. Conclusion: We identified the short, medium and long term impacts of bushfire exposure on the wellbeing of children in Australia. We did not identify any evidence-based interventions for supporting outcomes for this population. Given the likely increase in bushfire events in Australia, research into effective interventions should be a priority.","","0025-729X and 1326-5377","","MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA","","S14","0025-729X and 1326-5377",""

Virtually every decision within wildland fire management includes substantial ethical dimensions. As pressures increase with ever-growing fires, it is becoming increasingly important to develop tools for assessing and acting on the values intrinsic to wildfire management. Aims. This paper aims to foster an applied ethics of wildland fire by bringing values to the forefront of wildland fire management debates, highlighting areas where ethical issues have been previously discussed, and providing a framework to assist in future discussion. Methods. Through a literature review and collaborative thematic coding of a large set of ethical dilemmas, a list of ethical lenses was developed. Key results. Five ethical lenses were generated from the thematic coding process: Epistemologies and Representation, Values and Priorities, Risk and Uncertainty, Power, and Metaethics. Conclusion. The five lenses provide a framework to identify prospective ethical tensions in wildland fire decision-making, both within and cutting across categories. This framework provides a way of structuring future investigations into wildfire ethics, as well as a starting point for developing techniques to integrate community and stakeholder values. Implications. Developing a field of applied ethics for wildland fire will help support decision-making, create space to more inclusively reflect and deliberate on values, and ensure that fire management best serves the public interest.","10.1071/WF22020","1049-8001 and 1448-5516","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE","10","911","1049-8001 and 1448-5516",""

We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.","10.1139/X06-017","0045-5067 and 1208-6037","","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH","5","1299","0045-5067 and 1208-6037",""

Concerning wildfire susceptibility reduction at the landscape scale, forest ecosystem experts play a key role in offering advice about appropriate fuel man-agement practices to be applied by forest owners or their organizations, and in shaping public policies. A literature review aimed at identifying fuel management interventions and techniques found multiple and even opposing strategies. Recognizing the interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional nature of fuel management, we go beyond existing studies on forest experts' opinions by comparing evaluations across forest experts with diverse training and experience, and by considering different evaluation criteria such as technical effectiveness, impact on soil or biodiversity, socioeconomic impact, and preference. Following an online survey to a sample of Por-tuguese experts, distinct socio-professional clusters were established and experts' evaluations associated with their views on fire, forests, owners' coordination, and rural development. Results show that experts rank their preferences by weighing effectiveness and impacts in different ways. Closer knowledge of the local context distinguishes expert preference, favouring more active fuels reduction strategies. Since experts with a closer knowledge of socioeconomic context tend to be further from policy-making processes, we urge their more balanced participation in those processes.","10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105580","0264-8377 and 1873-5754","","LAND USE POLICY","","","0264-8377 and 1873-5754",""

One approach allowable under United States federal wildland fire policy that could help address this condition is by deliberately managing wildfire with a strategy other than full suppression (hereafter referred to as 'managed wildfire'). To improve the understanding of the managed fire decision-making process, we conducted a mixed methods review of the existing literature. This review spanned 1976 to 2013 and used thematic coding to identify key factors that affect the decision to manage a wildfire. A total of 110 descriptive factors categories were identified. These were classified into six key thematic groups, which addressed specific decision considerations. This nexus of factors and decision pathways formed what we describe as the 'Managed Fire Decision Framework', which contextualizes important pressures, barriers, and facilitators related to managed wildfire decision-making. The most prevalent obstacles to managing wildfire were operational concerns and risk aversion. The factor most likely to support managing a fire was the decision maker's desire to see the strategy be implemented. Ultimately, we found that the managed fire decision-making process is extremely complex, and that this complexity may itself be a barrier to its implementation.","10.3390/fire4030062","2571-6255","","FIRE-SWITZERLAND","3","","2571-6255",""

The primary goal of this synthesis is to provide insight into the source, transportation, translocation and fate of legacy Hg in forests. Existing data indicate that forests represent the largest atmospheric Hg sink in the terrestrial ecosystem, with atmospheric total Hg deposition of 2200-3400 Mg yr(-1) (i.e., relative to 40-65% atmospheric Hg pool size) and 500-1100 Gg of Hg stored in surface soils and vegetation. The climate and land cover changes, deforestation and wildfire re-volatilize several hundred tons of Hg into the atmosphere, thus increasing the ecological risk to the regional and global environments. Vegetative uptake of Hg-0 vapor from air predominantly controls Hg accumulation and isotopic fractionation in the atmosphere and in global forests. With the ongoing Hg emission reduction from anthropogenic sources required by the Minamata Convention, an integrated assessment on the changing biogeochemical processes and isotopic fractionation in response to human and natural perturbations of emissions, climate, and land use is needed.","10.1080/10643389.2021.1961505","1064-3389 and 1547-6537","","CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","21","3763","1064-3389 and 1547-6537",""

The paired -watershed method, consisting of comparing a burnt (altered) watershed with an unburnt (control) watershed, is commonly adopted in studies addressing the hydrological effects of wildfires. This approach requires a calibration period to assess the pre -perturbation differences and relationships between the control and the altered watershed. Unfortunately, in many studies, the calibration phase is lacking due to the unpredictability of wildfires and the large number of processes that should be investigated. So far, no information is available on the possible bias induced by the lack of the calibration period in the paired -watershed method when assessing the hydrological impacts of wildfires. Through a literature review, the consequences of the lack of calibration on the assessment of wildfire hydrological changes were evaluated, along with the most used watershed pairing strategies. The literature analysis showed that if calibration is lacking, misestimation of wildfire impacts is likely, particularly when addressing low -severity or long-term wildfire effects. The Euclidean distance based on physical descriptors (geology, morphology, vegetation) was proposed as a metric of watersheds similarity and tested in mountain watersheds in Central Italy. The Euclidean distance proved to be an effective metric for selecting the most similar watershed pairs. This work raises awareness of biases exerted by lacking calibration in pairedwatershed studies and proposes a rigorous and objective methodology for future studies on the hydrological effects of wildfires.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173488","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026",""

Some limited research has been undertaken into this individual decision making in bushfires. Other fields of emergency management also require people to make similar decisions as to whether to evacuate or stay in a ""defend in place"" situation. This paper examines research into ""stay or go"" strategies and decision making performance for high rise buildings, looking for common factors that may inform the bushfire situation and potential reforms for policy. Similarly, research into Hurricane Katrina and the failures to evacuate when mandated provide further insight into factors which can affect or postpone decision making. A number of common improvements related to emergency preparedness, situation awareness and trusted communication systems emerge in all these fields. However, this paper also suggests that this decision making in bushfires is more complex that just two simple options of ""stay or go"".

We use literature review, synthesis and model simulations to explore the role of mosses in ecological stability and resilience. Moss community responses to disturbance showed all possible responses (increases, decreases, no change) within most disturbance categories. Simulations from two process-based models suggest that northern ecosystems would need to experience extreme perturbation before mosses were eliminated. But simulations with two other models suggest that loss of moss will reduce soil carbon accumulation primarily by influencing decomposition rates and soil nitrogen availability. It seems clear that mosses need to be incorporated into models as one or more plant functional types, but more empirical work is needed to determine how to best aggregate species. We highlight several issues that have not been adequately explored in moss communities, such as functional redundancy and singularity, relationships between response and effect traits, and parameter vs conceptual uncertainty in models. Mosses play an important role in several ecosystem processes that play out over centuries permafrost formation and thaw, peat accumulation, development of microtopography and there is a need for studies that increase our understanding of slow, long-term dynamical processes.","10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04254.x","0028-646X and 1469-8137","","NEW PHYTOLOGIST","1","49","0028-646X and 1469-8137",""

We intend to determine the current state and evolution of global research on drought-induced tree mortality mechanisms. The results reveal that research on drought-induced tree mortality mechanisms gained momentum predominantly in the last two decades, with a marked surge post-2012. The United States is the epicenter of research, leading the global scientific community with its preeminence in publication volume, citation rates, and the scope of collaborative networks, with China in close pursuit.

However, insufficient funding limits implementation of critically needed management. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-benefit framework that leverages the diverse benefits of forest management to engage a suite of stakeholders in sharing project costs. We take a three-pronged approach to develop our conceptual model: examining existing frameworks for environmental project implementation, conducting a literature review of forest management benefits, and evaluating case studies. Through our framework, we describe the steps to engage partners, starting by identifying benefits that could accrue to potential public and private beneficiaries, and moving through an iterative and collaborative process of valuing benefits, which can accrue over different spatial and temporal scales, in close consultation with potential beneficiaries themselves. The aim of this approach is to stack funding streams associated with each valued benefit to fully fund a given forest management project. The multi-benefit framework has the potential to unlock new sources of funding to meet the exceptional challenges of climate and wildfire disturbances. We apply the framework to dry forests of the Western U.S., but opportunities exist for expanding and modifying this approach to any geography or ecosystem where management provides multiple benefits.","10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118270","0301-4797 and 1095-8630","","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","","","0301-4797 and 1095-8630",""

A Thailand Perspective","2019","5","4","353","search 4, search 5","search, search","Purpose of Review A large body of epidemiological evidence demonstrates that exposure to particulate matter (PM) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Many epidemiology studies have investigated the health effects of PM in Europe and North America and focussed on traffic derived PM. However, elevated levels of PM are a global problem and the impacts of other sources of PM on health should be assessed. Biomass burning can increase PM levels in urban and rural indoor and outdoor environments in developed and developing countries. We aim to identify whether the health effects of traffic and biomass burning derived PM are similar by performing a narrative literature review. We focus on Thailand as haze episodes from agricultural biomass burning can substantially increase PM levels. Recent Findings Existing epidemiology, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that biomass burning derived PM elicits toxicity via stimulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and genotoxicity. Thus, it is likely to cause similar adverse health outcomes to traffic PM, which causes toxicity via similar mechanisms. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether traffic or biomass burning derived PM is most hazardous. Also, there is evidence that PM released from different biomass sources varies in its toxic potency. We recommend that epidemiology studies are performed in Thailand to better understand the impacts of PM emitted from specific biomass sources (e.g. agricultural burning). Further, experimental studies should assess the toxicity of PM emitted from more diverse biomass sources. This will fill knowledge gaps and inform evidence-based interventions that protect human health.","10.1007/s40726-019-00125-4","2198-6592","","CURRENT POLLUTION REPORTS","4","353","2198-6592",""

The role of land abandonment in modifying disturbance regimes has been highlighted for some types of disturbances, albeit being still somewhat overlooked compared to climate change. Objectives This literature review is aimed at highlighting the most relevant effects of land abandonment and land-use legacy on the regime of different types of forest disturbances, providing insight into land-use change/disturbances interactions. Methods We searched in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for relevant studies at the global scale dealing with eight major natural disturbances: avalanche, flooding, herbivory, insect outbreak, landslide, rockfall, wildfire and windthrow. We classified papers into five relevance classes, with the highest score (4) assigned to studies quantitatively measuring the interactions between abandonment dynamics and disturbance regimes. Results Most papers focused on wildfires in Mediterranean Europe in the twentieth century, where landscape homogenisation and fuel build-up contributed to worsening their frequency, size and severity. Dense forests developed following land abandonment instead exert inhibiting effects toward mass movements such as avalanches, rockfalls and landslides. Regarding the other investigated disturbances, we found only a few studies presenting site-specific and partly contrasting effects. Conclusions Land abandonment triggers ecological processes at the landscape scale, altering land cover patterns and vegetation communities, which in turn affect disturbance regimes. Implications for land and resource management mostly depend on the stage at which post-abandonment secondary succession has developed.","10.1007/s10980-020-01147-w","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","12","2723","0921-2973 and 1572-9761",""

Disturbance due to heavy livestock use, wildfire, and recreation and energy development has increased the need for restoration of salt deserts in the western United States. However, restoration often fails due to invasive annual species and poor native plant establishment. In addition to a literature review, we surveyed restored salt desert sites in National Conservation Areas and other public lands in western Colorado ranging in age (3-63 yr) and restoration methods to assess approaches that were more or less successful. We used non-parametric ordination techniques to compare plant communities to environmental and restoration explanatory variables. Restored communities tended to move toward reference condition over time, but soil type, seeding, and type of disturbance also influenced plant community recovery. Overgrazed sites passively restored by long-term livestock exclusion were most similar to reference sites, while sites affected by wildfire and soil-related disturbances were most different from reference with non-native invasive annual grass (primarily Bromus tectorum) and forbs being common. These undesirable species were also more abundant on seeded sites than non-seeded or references sites, although mixes with a higher proportion of native species tended to improve outcomes. Results suggest that disturbance type and management approaches can have a large impact on restoration success in Intermountain West salt deserts, though many questions require further research.","10.3368/er.36.3.177","1543-4060 and 1543-4079","","ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION","3","177","1543-4060 and 1543-4079",""

Both climate change and management have shaped peatlands over millennia, sometimes negatively, sometimes positively. Across the globe, prescribed fire is an important and well-recognised vegetation management tool used to promote biodiversity, increase habitat heterogeneity and mitigate uncontrolled wildfires. However, in the UK, there is an ongoing debate about the efficacy and legitimacy of using prescribed fire as a vegetation management tool. The debate centres around the extent to which prescribed burning is associated with a decline in habitat status and ecological function, especially in relation to carbon storage within heather-dominated blanket bog peatlands. Robust reviews of the evidence base are thus required to disentangle this debate and inform land management policies that ensure the protection and enhancement of blanket bog ecological functioning. Here, we critically review ""Carbon storage and sequestration by habitat: a review of the evidence (second edition)"" by Gregg et al., 2021.

Communication is crucial in emergencies, to prepare for risks, warn people, reduce impacts, save lives and increase resilience. Social media has become increasingly important for both sourcing and disseminating information during natural hazards. The vast amount of data generated by social media users can be analysed for situational awareness, impacts and community sentiments during natural hazards. The full potential for social media to fulfil these roles in Australia is not yet well understood. In this study, we provide a literature review about the use of social media during natural hazards in Australia. We then assess public preferences for the use of social media during natural hazards using data collected through an online survey (n = 1665). Results suggest that social media is still largely underutilised for emergency communication. However, those with a high capacity to prepare for emergencies were more likely to use social media during natural hazards than those who relied on decisions being made by local authorities. Respondents' age did not explain the use of social media during natural hazards, but gender did with women more likely to do so than men. The presence of children in a household increased the use of social media during natural hazards, suggesting that the family structure plays a role in disaster communication. Finally, the main barriers to using social media during natural hazards were the spread of conflicting information and rumours on social media.","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103207","2212-4209","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","","","2212-4209",""

Remote sensing provides opportunities to analyse the impacts of prescribed burning, yet a comprehensive understanding of the applications of remote sensing for prescribed burn research is lacking. We conduct a literature review of 120 peer-reviewed publications to synthesise the research aims, methodologies, limitations and future directions of remote sensing for the analysis of prescribed fire. Studies evaluating management outcomes found prescribed burning effective for wildfire risk reduction, yet few analysed co-benefits or trade-offs with other management goals. Most studies use passive, spaceborne, low spatial resolution sensors, characterised in the literature as consistent and accessible data sources but limited in detecting small, low-severity and short-duration fires characteristic of prescribed burns. In contrast, active remote sensing approaches including LiDAR are less frequently employed, but show promise for highly accurate, spatially explicit 3D vegetation and fuel load mapping. Remote sensing advances toward higher spatial resolution, more frequent revisit, denser spectral sampling and more data across the electromagnetic spectrum are critical to advancing prescribed fire research, addressing current methodological gaps, and improving fuels and fire management capacity. Remote sensing is frequently used in fire ecology and management, but its applications for prescribed burning are not well established. We review studies that use remote sensing for prescribed burn research, finding that wildfire remote sensing approaches are not optimised for small, short-duration and low-severity burns typical of prescribed fire.","10.1071/WF23130","1049-8001 and 1448-5516","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE","6","","1049-8001 and 1448-5516",""

Russia has an important role regarding BC emissions given the extent of its territory above the Arctic Circle, where BC emissions have a particularly pronounced effect on the climate. We assess underlying methodologies and data sources for each major emissions source based on their level of detail, accuracy and extent to which they represent current conditions. We then present reference values for each major emissions source. In the case of flaring, the study presents new estimates drawing on data on Russia's associated petroleum gas and the most recent satellite data on flaring. We also present estimates of organic carbon (OC) for each source, either based on the reference studies or from our own calculations. In addition, the study provides uncertainty estimates for each source. Total BC emissions are estimated at 688 Gg in 2014, with an uncertainty range 401 Gg-1453 Gg, while OC emissions are 9224 Gg with uncertainty ranging between 5596 Gg and 14,736 Gg. Wildfires dominated and contributed about 83% of the total BC emissions: however, the effect on radiative forcing is mitigated in part by OC emissions. We also present an adjusted estimate of Arctic forcing from Russia's BC and OC emissions. In recent years, Russia has pursued policies to reduce flaring and limit particulate emissions from on-road transport, both of which appear to significantly contribute to the lower emissions and forcing values found in this study.

Fuel accumulation models are an important tool in wildfire management as fuel is the only component that can be directly controlled by fire managers. Here we discuss various strengths and limitations of analytical fuel accumulation models that exist in the literature, with a focus on those used in Australia. Early approaches to analytical or continuous models of fuel accumulation centred around the model introduced by Olson in 1963. This model assumes that the rate at which fuel accumulates is determined as a balance between the rate of fuel accession and the rate at which it decays. The Olson model has been shown to provide a reasonable description of litter accumulation, data sparsity issues notwithstanding, but can be of limited use in describing elevated fuels, or in forest stands that exhibit more complex post-disturbance dynamics. Interactions between species and other disturbances have the potential to change the dynamics of fuel accumulation and decay processes. Moreover, post-fire vegetation stands are usually dominated by an understorey layer that eventually senesces as the dominant vegetation grows. Motivated by the critical differences between the models presented, a more general approach featuring vegetation density is proposed. A generic result is presented to indicate how the theoretical predictions of the model are able to emulate patterns of fuel accumulation that have been reported, and that can not be accounted for by the models commonly used in Australia.","10.1071/WF20031","1049-8001 and 1448-5516","","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE","1","42","1049-8001 and 1448-5516",""

These are usually known as exotic species that proliferate intensely, spread rapidly and persist as dominant in the new community. However, some native species may behave the same way and bring serious ecological and economical losses. Nonetheless these native species may not attract management efforts and specific policies, partially because of the assumption that native species are harmless. We review the concepts of invasive species and show the potential harm of overabundant populations of native species, which we name ""super-dominant"" species. Based on literature review we demonstrated the lack of information on the Brazilian super-dominant plant species. Considering all kinds of published material and knowledge from our own experience we selected 16 Brazilian native terrestrial plants that most frequently show unexpectedly intense growth and dominance in their original habitats. We discuss the factors that may have triggered atypical dominance, negative impacts of these species on the native biodiversity and ecosystems, and future trends. Anthropogenic disturbances are the main drivers of the explosive population growth of these native species, especially habitat fragmentation, forest gap formation, and wildfires. The absence of legal support to deal with super-dominant native species is probably the main reason for the lack of disclosure of the subject. In the future scenario of climate change we expect the intensification of the phenomenon. Strategies for early detection and control need to be fast developed.

Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review. Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development, habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency coordination and new laws and regulations.

We review studies that propose optimization models to supporting the following four relief logistics operations: (i) relief items distribution, (ii) location of relief facilities and temporary shelters, (iii) integrated relief items distribution and shelter location, and (iv) transportation of affected population.

The results of hydrological and meteorological data analysis suggest that the Vitimkan River basin had a rapid and profound hydrological response to wildfire in 2003 expressed through a 41% (133mm) increase of summer flow. Conversely, the larger Vitim River basin showed no significant changes in discharge after the fire. The parameters of the process-based hydrological model Hydrograph were estimated for pre-fire conditions. The results of runoff simulations conducted for the continuous pre-fire periods of 1966-2002 and 1970-2002 for the Vitimkan and Vitim river basins, respectively, on a daily time step, showed satisfactory agreement with the observed flow series of both basins. Significant underestimation of precipitation and its poor representativeness for mountainous watersheds was revealed as the main cause of observed and simulated flow discrepancies, especially for high flood events. The set of dynamic parameters was developed based on data analysis and post-fire landscape changes as derived from a literature review. The model was applied to investigate the processes in the soil column and their effect on runoff formation during the post-fire period. The new set of model parameters implied the intensification of soil thaw, reduction of infiltration rate and evapotranspiration, and increase of upper subsurface flow fraction in summer flood events following the fire. According to modelling results, the post-fire thaw depth exceeded the pre-fire thaw depth by 0.4-0.7m.

To overcome this situation, a coupling of chemical mass concentration modelling with satellite-based measurements relying on physical and optical principles has been developed. This study deals with the observation operator for a component-wise assimilation of satellite measurements. It treats aerosol particles classified into water soluble, water insoluble, soot, sea salt and mineral dust containing aerosol particles in the atmospheric boundary layer as separately assimilated aerosol components. It builds on a mapping of aerosol classes used both in observation and model space taking their optical and chemical properties into account. Refractive indices for primary organic carbon particles, anthropogenic particles, and secondary organic species have been defined based on a literature review. Together with a treatment of different size distributions in observations and model state, this allows transforming the background from mass concentrations into aerosol optical depths. A two-dimensional, variational assimilation is applied for component-wise aerosol optical depths. Error covariance matrices are defined based on a validation against AERONET sun photometer measurements. Analysis fields are assessed threefold: (1) through validation against AERONET especially in Saharan dust outbreak situations, (2) through comparison with the British Black Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide Network for soot-containing particles, and (3) through comparison with measurements of the water soluble components SO4, NH4, and NO3 conducted by the EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) network. Separately, for the water soluble, the soot and the mineral dust aerosol components a bias reduction and subsequent a root mean square error reduction is observed in the analysis for a test period from July to November 2003.

Most publications studied the direct effects of wildfire related damage. Secondary impacts such as smoke, rural and urban communities, and the role of poverty and language were less studied. Based on a proposed wildfire-relevant EJ definition, the first EJ publication was in 2004, but the term was first used as a keyword in 2018. Studies in WUI communities statistically decreased the likelihood that a publication was EJ relevant. There was a significant relationship between EJ designation and inclusion of race/ethnicity and poverty variables in the study. Complexity across the various definitions of EJ suggest that it should not be used as a quantitative or binary metric; but as a lens to better understand socio-ecological impacts to diverse communities. We present a wildfire-relevant definition to potentially guide policy formulation and account for social and environmental justice issues.","10.1371/journal.pone.0271019","1932-6203","","PLOS ONE","7","","1932-6203",""

At the same time, it is widely known that extreme weather events intrinsically exacerbate air pollution impact. Particularly, hot weather and extreme temperatures during heat waves (HW) significantly affect human health, increasing risks of respiratory mortality and morbidity. Concurrently, a synergistic effect of air pollution and high temperatures can be combined with weather-air pollution interaction during wildfires. The purpose of the current review is to summarize literature on interplay of hot weather, air pollution, and respiratory health consequences worldwide, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most dangerous pollution agents and vulnerable population groups. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Scopus, focusing only on peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2000 to 2021. The main findings demonstrate that the increased level of PM10 and O-3 results in significantly higher rates of respiratory and cardiopulmonary mortality. Increments in PM2.5 and PM10, O-3, CO, and NO2 concentrations during high temperature episodes are dramatically associated with higher admissions to hospital in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, daily hospital emergency transports for asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, and premature mortality caused by respiratory disease. Excessive respiratory health risk is more pronounced in elderly cohorts and small children. Both heat waves and outdoor air pollution are synergistically linked and are expected to be more serious in the future due to greater climate instability, being a crucial threat to global public health that requires the responsible involvement of researchers at all levels. Sustainable urban planning and smart city design could significantly reduce both urban heat islands effect and air pollution.","10.3390/atmos12060790","2073-4433","","ATMOSPHERE","6","","2073-4433",""

In this context, land-use change has promoted land abandonment and the consequent accumulation of biomass (fuel) in (progressively less managed) forests and (non-forest) natural land, causing higher fire density and severity, economic damage, and land degradation. The expansion of Wildland-Urban Interfaces (WUIs) further affects fire density by negatively impacting peri-urban farming and livestock density. Assuming the role of grazing in controlling fuel accumulation in forests and non-forest natural land as an indirect measure of wildfire containment around large Mediterranean cities, our work focuses on the role of nomadic livestock, i.e., sheep and goats-the most abundant and traditional farm species in the area. The present study (i) investigates the relationship between fire frequency/extent and livestock decline at the regional level in Greece, (ii) explores changes over time in regional wildfire regimes, comparing Attica, a particularly vulnerable peri-urban region which includes Athens (the Greek capital city), with the rest of the country, and (iii) quantifies trends over time in livestock characteristics (population structure and dynamics) over a sufficiently long time interval (1961-2017) at the same spatial scale, with the aim to document the progressive reduction of nomadic livestock in peri-urban districts. A comprehensive analysis of statistical data, corroborated with a literature review, outlined the relationship between livestock decline over time and changes in specific wildfire characteristics at the regional scale, evidencing peculiar environmental conditions in Attica. In this region, a rapid decline of nomadic livestock was observed compared to in the rest of Greece, leading to a higher wildfire risk. The results of this study suggest that nomadic livestock contributes to sustainable management of peri-urban land, stimulating grazing that may prevent fuel accumulation in fringe woodlands.","10.3390/land9010021","2073-445X","","LAND","1","","2073-445X",""

A Brief Critical Review and Proposed New Rainfall Intensity Index for Application in the Study of Landsurface Processes","2020","12","4","","search 4, search 5","search, search","In many studies of landsurface processes, the intensity of rainfall events is expressed with clock-period indexes such as I-30, the wettest 30-minute interval within a rainfall event. Problematically, the value of I-30 cannot be estimated for rainfall events shorter than 30 min, excluding many intense convective storms. Further, it represents a diminishing proportion of increasingly long rainfall events, declining to <2% of the duration of a 30-hour event but representing 25% of the duration of a two-hour event. Here, a new index termed EDf5 is proposed: It is the rainfall depth in the wettest 5% of the event duration. This can be derived for events of any duration. Exploratory determinations of EDf5 are presented for two Australian locations with contrasting rainfall climatologies one arid and one wet tropical. The I-30 index was similar at both sites (7.7 and 7.9 mm h(-1)) and was unable to differentiate between them. In contrast, EDf5 at the arid site was 7.4 mm h(-1), whilst at the wet tropical site, it was 3.8 mm h(-1). Thus, the EDf5 index indicated a greater concentration of rain at the arid site where convective storms occurred (i.e., the intensity sustained for 5% of event duration at that site is higher). The EDf5 index can be applied to short, intense events that can readily be included in the analysis of event-based rainfall intensity. I-30 therefore appears to offer less discriminatory power and consequently may be of less value in the investigation of rainfall characteristics that drive many important landsurface processes.","10.3390/w12040929","2073-4441","","WATER","4","","2073-4441",""

They can change the physical and biotic landscape by altering the flow of resources among trophic levels, thereby affecting ecosystem functioning. Although the effects of fire on some ungulates have been well studied, data gaps exist for many species, including canids, felids, mustelids and ursids among others. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a literature review to synthesize what is known about large and medium mammal responses to fire, including communities, species richness and species interactions in connection with fire. Twenty-seven large and medium mammal species were studied. Fifty percent of the studies examined ungulates, far exceeding studies of other trophic levels. Eighty-six percent were conducted on large mammals with significantly fewer studies on medium-sized mammals. Only four studies examined multiple species responses to fire. Results indicated that fire had a largely positive effect on large- and medium-sized mammals. However, considerable heterogeneity exists within and among taxa. Most fire research has been conducted on focal species rather than on biodiversity, and a large data gap exists on the interactions within or among large- and medium-sized mammals. Forest management focus is changing from fire suppression to reinstating natural fire regimes. Effectiveness monitoring programmes will be needed to test the efficacy of restoration strategies in mammalian communities.

The analysis is built based on existing literature review and evaluation reports concerning investment projects in biomass-to-energy power plants. A spreadsheet economic model combining net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP) is developed over the plant's lifetime period of 25 years. Cost factors incurred in initial investment, amortizations, fixed assets and working capital investments, financial income, operation and maintenance costs, employees and structure costs. Revenues are generated from selling electricity to the grid. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis is employed to gauge the economic model performance and investment risk. Lastly, an assessment of the environmental impact, noxious emissions and future prospects to this biomass-based energy conversion process are addressed. Results predict the feasibility of the project, with an NPV of 2.367 M(sic), an IRR of 8.66% and PBP of 23.1 years. Sensitivity analysis foresees affordable risks for investors, and that the project's NPV is highly sensitive to the electricity sales price and electricity production. Despite the viability of the project delivered by the economic model, the economic performance is strongly reliant on revenues from electricity sales regulated by uncertain tariffs and reimbursements.

If the model can reproduce major patterns in vegetation and ecosystem processes, we consider this to be an important linkage between plant physiology and larger-scale ecosystem dynamics. Location The location is global, geographically distributed. Methods A literature review was carried out to derive model formulations and parameter values for representing the hydraulic characteristics of major global plant functional types (PFTs) in a DGVM. After implementing the corresponding formulations within the LPJ-DGVM, present-day model output was compared to observational data. Results The model reproduced observed broad-scale patterns in potential natural vegetation, but it failed to distinguish accurately between different types of grassland and savanna vegetation, possibly related to inadequate model representations of water fluxes in the soil and wildfire effects. Compared to a version of the model using an empirical formulation for calculating plant water supply without considering plant hydraulic architecture, the new formulation improved simulated patterns of vegetation in particular for dry shrublands. Global-scale simulation results for runoff and actual evapotranspiration (AET) corresponded well to available data. The model also successfully reproduced the magnitude and seasonal cycle of AET for most EUROFLUX forests, while modelled variation in NPP across a large number of sites spanning several biomes showed a strong correlation with estimates from field measurements. Main conclusions The model was generally confirmed by comparison to observational data. The novel model representation of water flow within plants makes it possible to resolve mechanistically the effects of hydraulic differences between plant functional groups on vegetation structure, water cycling, and competition. This may be an advantage when predicting ecosystem responses to nonextant climates, in particular in areas dominated by dry shrubland vegetation.","10.1111/j.1466-8238.2006.00254.x","1466-822X and 1466-8238","","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","6","567","1466-822X and 1466-8238",""

However, the full scope of the ecological damage is often hard to assess, in part due to limited information on the types of chemicals introduced to affected landscapes and waterways. The objective of this study was to establish a sampling, analytical, and interpretive framework to effectively identify and monitor contaminants of emerging concern in environmental water samples impacted by wildfire runoff. A nontargeted analysis consisting of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC/TOF-MS) was conducted on stormwater samples from watersheds in the City of Santa Rosa and Sonoma and Napa Counties, USA, after the three most destructive fires during the October 2017 Northern California firestorm. Chemicals potentially related to wildfires were selected from the thousands of chromatographic features detected through a screening method that compared samples from fire-impacted sites versus unburned reference sites. This screening led to high confidence identifications of 76 potentially fire-related compounds. Authentic standards were available for 48 of these analytes, and 46 were confirmed by matching mass spectra and GC x GC retention times. Of these 46 compounds, 37 had known commercial and industrial uses as intermediates or ingredients in plastics, personal care products, pesticides, and as food additives. Nine compounds had no known uses or sources and may be oxidation products resulting from burning of natural or anthropogenic materials. Preliminary examination of potential toxicity associated with the 46 compounds, conducted via online databases and literature review, indicated limited data availability. Regional comparison suggested that more structural damage may yield a greater number of unique, potentially wildfire-related compounds. We recommend further study of post-wildfire runoff using the framework described here, which includes hypothesis-driven site selection and nontargeted analysis, to uncover potentially significant stormwater contaminants not routinely monitored after wildfires and inform risk assessment.

Here we show that meteorological radar has been demonstrated as an effective tool for profiling the microphysics, thermodynamics, and fire behavior feedback of wildfire plumes, including for cases with deep and moist convection occurring in the fire plume. A synthesis of knowledge on the use of radar for the analysis of wildfire is presented, and the new term pyrometeor is introduced to describe the range of scatterers observed by radar, the reflectivity signature of which is determined by interacting processes of wildfire behavior and atmospheric convection. The reflectivity theories of pyrometeors are compared, and it is shown that there are gaps in knowledge on the size distributions of pyrometeors as well as the complex dielectrics. Observational case studies are compared across plume microphysics, plume thermodynamics and deep pyroconvection, and operational usage of radar to monitor wildfire. The dominant hypothesis of reflectivity is scattering from ash particles, though theories for scattering such as from larger debris exist, although evidence is limited for any hypothesis. Vortices have also been identified using Doppler velocity radar data, but there is limited understanding of their cause and influence on fire-atmosphere interactions. Recommendations are provided for methods and data sets to advance the application of radar for observing and understanding wildfires, including for plume microphysics and atmosphere-fire interactions.

The understanding of theory alongside what has been observed can inform decision makers and future scientific study to better interpret weather radar observations of wildfire plumes and meteorology. It is intended that this will lead to an improved ability to prepare for, and manage, the hazards associated with wildfires.","10.1029/2018JD029285","2169-897X and 2169-8996","","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES","1","266","2169-897X and 2169-8996",""

Fire has the potential to affect the physicochemical and ecological status of water systems, alter several aspects of the carbon cycle (e.g. above- and below-ground carbon storage) and trigger changes in vegetation type and structure. Globally, fire is an essential part of land management in fire-prone regions in, e.g. Australia, the USA and some Mediterranean countries to mitigate the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires and sustain healthy ecosystems. In the less-fire prone UK, fire has a long history of usage in management for enhancing the productivity of heather, red grouse and sheep. This distinctly different socioeconomic tradition of burning underlies some of the controversy in recent decades in the UK around the use of fire. Negative public opinion and opposition from popular media have highlighted concerns around the detrimental impacts burning can have on the health and diversity of upland habitats. It is evident there are many gaps in the current knowledge around the environmental impacts of prescribed burning in less fire-prone regions (e.g. UK). Land owners and managers require a greater level of certainty on the advantages and disadvantages of prescribed burning in comparison to other techniques to better inform management practices. This paper addresses this gap by providing a critical review of published work and future research directions related to the impacts of prescribed fire on three key aspects of ecosystem services: (i) water quality, (ii) carbon dynamics and (iii) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity). Its overall aims are to provide guidance based on the current state-of-the-art for researchers, land owners, managers and policy makers on the potential effects of the use of burning and to inform the wider debate about the place of fire in modern conservation and land management in humid temperate ecosystems.

After the hypothesis was first published in 2007, it gained much criticism, as the evidence presented was either not indicative of an extraterrestrial impact or not reproducible by other groups. Only three years after the hypothesis had been presented, a requiem paper was published. Despite this, the controversy continues. New evidence, both in favour and against the hypothesis, continues to be published. In this review we briefly summarize the earlier debate and critically analyse the most recent reported evidence, including magnetic microspherules, nanodiamonds, and iridium, shocked quartz, scoria-like objects and lechatelierite. The subsequent events proposed to be triggered by the impact event, as well as the nature of the event itself, are also briefly discussed. In addition we address the timing of the Younger Dryas impact, a topic which, despite its importance, has not gained much attention thus far. We show that there are three challenges related to the timing of the event: accurate age control for some of the sites that are reported to provide evidence for the impact, linking these sites to the onset of the Younger Dryas and, most importantly, an apparent age discrepancy of up to two centuries between different sites associated with the proposed impact event. We would like to stress that if the markers at different locations have been deposited at different points in time, they cannot be related to the same event. Although convincing evidence for the hypothesis that multiple synchronous impacts resulted in massive environmental changes at similar to 12,900 yrs ago remains debatable, we conclude that some evidence used to support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis cannot fully be explained at this point in time.

For this purpose, we require to associate the historical PBB outbreak points (2017-2019), with a series of environmental and anthropogenic variables that according to the literature review have affected the initiation and the spread of PBB outbreaks. To assess the current climatic variables we used MODIS land surface temperature product (LST-MOD11A2), wind speed, precipitation, and temperature acquired from the WorldClim data. To assess vegetation vigor, we use the Normalized drought moisture index estimated from the MODIS surface reflectance product (MODO9A3). To give us an understanding of the density of the forest, we compare two products, the MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI-MOD15A2H), and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VFC-MOD44B). We included elevation, aspect, and slope as variables and acquired this data from the Global multiresolution terrain elevation data (GMTED-2010). Finally, we used geographical information systems data to derive proximity to different types of roads as anthropogenic data and wildfire density. We do a preliminary analysis of the variables and eliminated those which show the least importance. Furthermore, we integrated the most relevant variables identified with the PBB points by using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to fit the model and then predicted the current PBB outbreak susceptibility for the dry and rainy season. Results indicated that climatic variables weigh heavily in determining high susceptibility areas. Our prediction results show high and very high susceptibility in the North-eastern and Central parts of the country especially. The results acquired, can lead to improved preventive and control measures to reduce the negative ecological effects that are caused by PBB outbreaks.","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118162","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

Proponents of the patch-burn mosaic (PBM) hypothesis suggest that these fires are unprecedented in the modern era and were formerly constrained by Aboriginal patch burning that kept landscape fuel levels low. This assumption deserves scrutiny, as evidence from fire-prone systems globally indicates that weather factors are the primary determinant behind megafire incidence, and that fuel management does not mitigate such fires during periods of climatic extreme. We reviewed explorer's diaries, anthropologist's reports, and remotely sensed data from the Australian Western Desert for evidence of large rainfall-linked fires during the pre-contact period when traditional Aboriginal patch burning was still being practiced. We used only observations that contained empiric estimates of fire sizes. Concurrently, we employed remote rainfall data and the Oceanic Nino Index to relate fire size to likely seasonal conditions at the time the observations were made. Numerous records were found of small fires during periods of average and below-average rainfall conditions, but no evidence of large-scale fires during these times. By contrast, there was strong evidence of large-scale wildfires during a high-rainfall period in the early 1870s, some of which are estimated to have burnt areas up to 700,000 ha. Our literature review also identified several Western Desert Aboriginal mythologies that refer to large-scale conflagrations. As oral traditions sometimes corroborate historic events, these myths may add further evidence that large fires are an inherent feature of spinifex grassland fire regimes. Overall, the results suggest that, contrary to predictions of the PBM hypothesis, traditional Aboriginal burning did not modulate spinifex fire size during periods of extreme-high arid zone rainfall. The mechanism behind this is that plant assemblages in seral spinifex vegetation comprise highly flammable non-spinifex tussock grasses that rapidly accumulate high fuel loads under favorable precipitation conditions. Our finding that fuel management does not prevent megafires under extreme conditions in arid Australia has parallels with the primacy of climatic factors as drivers of megafires in the forests of temperate Australia.","10.3389/fevo.2021.666241","2296-701X","","FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","","","2296-701X",""

Since its first atmospheric detection, significant progress has been made in understanding its sources and sinks. The chemistry of HNCO is governed by its partitioning between the gas and liquid phases, its weak acidity, its high solubility at pH above 5, and its electrophilic chemical behaviour. The online measurement of HNCO in ambient air is possible due to recent advances in mass spectrometry techniques, including chemical ionization mass spectrometry for the detection of weak acids. To date, HNCO has been measured in North America, Europe and South Asia as well as outdoors and indoors, with mixing ratios up to 10s of ppbv. The sources of HNCO include: (1) fossil fuel combustion such as coal, gasoline and diesel, (2) biomass burning such as wildfires and crop residue burning, (3) secondary photochemical production from amines and amides, (4) cigarette smoke, and (5) combustion of materials in the built environment. Then, three losses processes can occur: (1) gas phase photochemistry, (2) heterogenous uptake and hydrolysis, and (3) dry deposition. HNCO lifetimes with respect to photolysis and OH radical oxidation are on the order of months to decades. Consequently, the removal of HNCO from the atmosphere is thought to occur predominantly by dry deposition and by heterogeneous uptake followed by hydrolysis to NH3 and CO2. A back of the envelope calculation reveals that HNCO is an insignificant global source of NH3, contributing only around 1%, but could be important for local environments. Furthermore, HNCO can react due to its electrophilic behaviour with various nucleophilic functionalities, including those present in the human body through a reaction called protein carbamoylation. This protein modification can lead to toxicity, and thus exposure to high concentrations of HNCO can lead to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as cataracts.

Examples include improved wildlife habitat, enhanced biodiversity, reduced threat of destructive wildfire, and enhanced ecosystem resilience. Prescribed fire can also come with costs, such as reduced air quality and impacts to fire sensitive species. To plan for appropriate use of prescribed fire, managers need information on the tradeoffs between prescribed fire and wildfire regimes. In this study, we argue that information on tradeoffs should be presented at spatial and temporal scales commensurate with the scales at which these processes occur and that simulation modeling exercises should include some realistic measure of wildfire probability. To that end, we synthesized available scientific literature on relationships between prescribed fire and wildfire regimes, and their associated ecological and societal effects, focusing specifically on simulation modeling studies that consider wildfire probability and empirical and modeling studies that consider prescribed fire and wildfire regimes at spatial and temporal scales beyond individual events. Both empirical and modeling studies overwhelmingly show that increasing use of prescribed fire can result in wildfire regimes of lower extent and intensity. In some studies, a consequence associated with increased use of prescribed fire is an increase in the total, cumulative amount of fire on a landscape over time. Presumably this has implications for emissions and ecosystem carbon, however, effects on ecosystem carbon dynamics are much less clear as results vary considerably across studies. Results likely vary because studies use various landscape models with different parameter settings for processes (e.g., vegetation succession) and use different methodologies, time frames, and fire management and climate change scenarios. Future syntheses and meta-analyses would benefit from researchers providing more comprehensive and transparent documentation of model parameters, assumptions, and limitations. The literature review also revealed that studies on the implications of prescribed fire and wildfire regimes with regard to values other than carbon and emissions are scant and this represents a critical research need. Empirical studies are needed to calibrate and provide magnitude of order comparisons with simulation models and address tradeoffs with respect to other values (e.g., wildland urban interface, wildlife habitat). Such studies should be conducted with consideration for our framework, which includes the implications of prescribed fire and wildfire across broad spatial and temporal scales.","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118435","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042",""

We conducted a literature review to examine the evidence for effects of prolonged exposure to bushfire smoke on cattle. There was general agreement that small airborne particulate matter in smoke is the substance most likely to cause problems. There was indirect evidence about effects on cattle caused by other types of pollution containing particulate matter. We found little evidence to support severe effects on cattle. This may be because cattle do not tend to suffer from the co-morbidities that, in the human population, seem to be made worse by smoke and pollution. However, small changes to death rates or disease that is not severe may go unreported, so further study is warranted. In 2019-2020, a particularly bad bushfire season in Australia resulted in cattle being exposed to prolonged periods of smoke haze and reduced air quality. Bushfire smoke contains many harmful pollutants, and impacts on regions far from the fire front, with smoke haze persisting for weeks. Particulate matter (PM) is one of the major components of bushfire smoke known to have a negative impact on human health. However, little has been reported about the potential effects that bushfire smoke has on cattle exposed to smoke haze for extended periods. We explored the current literature to investigate evidence for likely effects on cattle from prolonged exposure to smoke generated from bushfires in Australia. We conducted a search for papers related to the impacts of smoke on cattle. Initial searching returned no relevant articles through either CAB Direct or PubMed databases, whilst Google Scholar provided a small number of results. The search was then expanded to look at two sub-questions: the type of pollution that is found in bushfire smoke, and the reported effects of both humans and cattle being exposed to these types of pollutants. The primary mechanism for damage due to bushfire smoke is due to small airborne particulate matter (PM). Although evidence demonstrates that PM from bushfire smoke has a measurable impact on both human mortality and cardiorespiratory morbidities, there is little evidence regarding the impact of chronic bushfire smoke exposure in cattle. We hypothesize that cattle are not severely affected by chronic exposure to smoke haze, as evidenced by the lack of reports. This may be because cattle do not tend to suffer from the co-morbidities that, in the human population, seem to be made worse by smoke and pollution. Further, small changes to background mortality rates or transient morbidity may also go unreported.","10.3390/ani11030848","2076-2615","","ANIMALS","3","","2076-2615",""

In this way, potential trade-offs and complementarities between different ecosystem services can be identified, so that policies can be designed to avoid the worst trade-offs, and where possible, enhance multiple services. The paper brings together evidence from across the Rural Economy and Land Use Programme's Sustainable Uplands project for the first time, with previously unpublished model outputs relating to runoff, agricultural suitability, biomass, heather cover, age, and utility for Red Grouse (Lagopus scotica), grass cover, and accompanying scenario narratives and video. Two contrasting scenarios, based on policies to extensify or intensify land management up to 2030, were developed through a combination of interviews and discussions during site visits with stakeholders, literature review, conceptual modeling, and process-based computer models, using the Dark Peak of the Peak District National Park in the UK as a case study. Where extensification leads to a significant reduction in managed burning and grazing or land abandonment, changes in vegetation type and structure could compromise a range of species that are important for conservation, while compromising provisioning services, amenity value, and increasing wildfire risk. However, where extensification leads to the restoration of peatlands damaged by former intensive management, there would be an increase in carbon sequestration and storage, with a number of cobenefits, which could counter the loss of habitats and species elsewhere in the landscape. In the second scenario, land use and management was significantly intensified to boost UK self-sufficiency in food. This would benefit certain provisioning services but would have negative consequences for carbon storage and water quality and would lead to a reduction in the abundance of certain species of conservation concern. The paper emphasizes the need for spatially explicit models that can track how ecosystem services might change over time, in response to policy or environmental drivers, and in response to the changing demands and preferences of society, which are far harder to anticipate. By developing such models in close collaboration with decision makers and other stakeholders, it is possible to depict scenarios of real concern to those who need to use the research findings. By engaging these collaborators with the research findings through film, it was possible to discuss adaptive options to minimize trade-offs and enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services under the very different future conditions depicted by each scenario. By preparing for as wide a range of futures as possible in this way, it may be possible for decision makers to act rapidly and effectively to protect and enhance the provision of ecosystem services in the face of unpredictable future change.","10.5751/ES-04924-180105","1708-3087","","ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY","1","","1708-3087",""

To mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (GG) in Brazil, one of the hypotheses would be to reduce deforestation, since most Brazilian GHG emissions result from deforestation and the burning of forests to make way for livestock. Reducing the worsening of global warming can be done through the storage of atmospheric carbon. Forests are of great importance in reducing global warming and climate change by sequestering carbon.

However, the spatial distribution of biomass supply and of heat demand limits the potentials of CHP production. This article assesses CHP potentials using a mixed integer programming model that optimizes locations of bioenergy plants. Investment costs of district heating infrastructure are modeled as a function of heat demand densities, which can differ substantially. Gasification of biomass in a combined cycle process is assumed as production technology. Some model parameters have a broad range according to a literature review. Monte-Carlo simulations have therefore been performed to account for model parameter uncertainty in our analysis. The model is applied to assess CHP potentials in Austria. Optimal locations of plants are clustered around big cities in the east of the country. At current power prices, biomass-based CHP production allows producing around 3% of the total energy demand in Austria. Yet, the heat utilization decreases when CHP production increases due to limited heat demand that is suitable for district heating. Production potentials are most sensitive to biomass costs and power prices.

The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision-making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near-real-time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi-year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD earlY-warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early-warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open-access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early-warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation. Our results provide tools for improving both the current MRV systems, and the deforestation early-warning system in Colombia.","10.1002/eap.1522","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","4","1294","1051-0761 and 1939-5582",""

The case study was established in Alfisols and slopes ranging from 30 to 60% in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, and compares secondary forests with mature teak plantations and young teak plantations under different management regimes. Over a period of 14 months with higher rainfall than the regional average, very little soil loss was registered in the teak plantations of Guanacaste, although there were slight differences between treatments (1-4 mm), while soil accumulation was measured in secondary forests (4 mm). A number of other authors also report low levels of soil loss in teak plantations and those studies in which high erosion rates have been identified tend to be associated with teak plantations where fires are a common phenomenon. Hence, we conclude that poor forest management (prescribed fires, machinery, extremely steep slopes, previous land use, etc.) rather than the nature of the teak itself causes the high rates of erosion.

Location Global. Time period 1994 to 2019. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods We reviewed the forest resilience literature using online databases, selecting 119 simulation modelling studies for further analysis. We identified a set of resilience mechanisms from the general resilience literature and analysed models for their representation of these mechanisms. Analyses were grouped by investigated drivers (resilience to what) and responses (resilience of what), as well as by the type of model being used. Results Models used to study forest resilience varied widely, from analytical approaches to complex landscape simulators. The most commonly addressed questions were associated with resilience of forest cover to fire. Important resilience mechanisms pertaining to regeneration, soil processes, and disturbance legacies were explicitly simulated in only 34 to 46% of the model applications.

The assessment focuses on 1) the specific impacts of climate change on air pollution and natural particle and precursor emissions in Europe in the near future (2030), by mid-century (2050) and by end of the century (2100), 2) impacts on air pollution due to changes in emissions vs. changes in climate, 3) feedbacks from air pollution on climate, 4) impacts of climate change on wildland fires and air pollutant levels, and 5) the role of adaptation and mitigation policies on climate change and air pollution. Available literature to a large extent suggests that ozone concentrations will likely increase in the second half of the century by up to 9 ppb [-4 + 9.3], while in the first half of the century, changes are much smaller and are up to +/- 1.5 ppb. These changes are mainly attributed to increased temperatures and emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, but also depends on the models and scenarios used in these studies. On the other hand, the predicted changes in particle concentrations and chemical composition are uncertain and much smaller. Similar to ozone, larger changes in the particle concentrations are projected in the second half of the century.

Prior to Euro-American settlement, much of the eastern deciduous forest was dominated by oak species. The role of periodic surface burning, agriculture, and other forms of land management by Indigenous peoples is frequently noted by cultural anthropologists and historical ecologists. However, these points are often debated by paleoecologists and climate scientists. Here we present a literature review, synthesis, and data summary to investigate the role of altered land use, season of burning, and climate change in relation to pre and post-Euro-American changes in forest composition. Human-based ignitions, as reflected by dormant-season fires, prevailed over the oak- and pine-dominated forests, with intermediate fire frequency during Indigenous periods. From the 18th century on, Euro-American populations rapidly expanded, impacting much of the eastern United States through extensive timber harvesting, land clearing, and severe fires. Starting in the 20th century, a variety of ecological influences, including agricultural land abandonment, chestnut blight, fire suppression, mesophication, and urbanization, resulted in dramatic vegetation changes in eastern landscapes. These trends have culminated in recruitment failures of most oak species on all but the most xeric sites and an increase in mid- to late-successional mesic hardwoods, most notably red maple (Ater rubrum), a species with very low density in our analysis of the witness tree record. We conclude that prescribed burning, agriculture, and other land uses by Indigenous peoples created a mosaicked landscape of expansive oak savannas, woodlands, and forests. A warming world over the past century should have promoted warm-adapted, fire-tolerant, xerophytic genera such as oak, hickory (Carya), and pine (Pinus) and grassland communities but instead have promoted the invasion by cool-adapted, fire-sensitive, mesophytic trees due to the absence of burning, much to the detriment of major vegetation biomes. Understanding that eastern oak and other pyrogenic ecosystems represent an Indigenous landscape strengthens our ability to best manage vegetation against the expansion of less desirable species and restore historic fire cycles through prescribed burning.","10.3159/TORREY-D-21-00024.1","1095-5674 and 1940-0616","","JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY","2","101","1095-5674 and 1940-0616",""

The pan-tropical geography of forest change is a challenge to assess, and improved estimates of the human footprint in the tropics are critical to understanding potential changes in biodiversity. We combined recently published and new satellite observations, along with images from Google Earth and a literature review, to estimate the contemporary global extent of deforestation, selective logging, and secondary regrowth in humid tropical forests. Roughly 1.4% of the biome was deforested between 2000 and 2005. As of 2005, about half of the humid tropical forest biome contained 50% or less tree cover. Although not directly comparable to deforestation, geographic estimates of selective logging indicate that at least 20% of the humid tropical forest biome was undergoing some level of timber harvesting between 2000 and 2005. Forest recovery estimates are even less certain, but a compilation of available reports suggests that at least 1.2% of the humid tropical forest biome was in some stage of long-term secondary regrowth in 2000. Nearly 70% of the regrowth reports indicate forest regeneration in hilly, upland, and mountainous environments considered marginal for large-scale agriculture and ranching. Our estimates of the human footprint are conservative because they do not resolve very small-scale deforestation, low-intensity logging, and unreported secondary regrowth, nor do they incorporate other impacts on tropical forest ecosystems, such as fire and hunting.
