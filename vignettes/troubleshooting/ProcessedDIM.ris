AB  - Abstract.—Data from research surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center and the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) were examined along with catch data from NMFS’s North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program to determine the distribution, abundance, and status of spiny dogfish <em>Squalus acanthias </em>in Alaska. Dogfish are present in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands but survey and observer data indicate they are most abundant in the central and eastern Gulf of Alaska in waters less than 200 m deep. All data sources indicate that dogfish have increased in abundance in the Gulf of Alaska in recent years. Log-transformed catch per unit effort (CPUE) of dogfish calculated from the NMFS trawl survey data ranged from 0.47 sharks/km2 in 1984 to 0.91 sharks/km2 in 2007, with a peak of 1.17 sharks/km2 in 2003. Log-transformed CPUE of spiny dogfish calculated from the NMFS longline survey data ranged from 0.041 sharks/100 hooks in 1979 to 0.16 sharks/100 hooks in 2007, with peaks in abundance of 0.23 sharks/100 hooks in 1983 and 1998. Log-transformed CPUE of dogfish calculated from the IPHC annual longline survey data showed a similar trend and ranged from 0.84 sharks/100 hooks in 1997 to 1.18 sharks/100 hooks in 2006, with a peak value of 1.38 sharks/100 hooks in 2003. Estimates of the incidental catch of dogfish by Alaska fisheries in the Gulf of Alaska calculated from NMFS observer data from 1990 to 2007 were variable and ranged from 140 to 865 metric tons (mt), with peak values of over 650 mt in years 1998, 1999, 2006, and 2007. Dogfish are currently managed as a member of the “other species” complex by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council in Alaska waters. The increasing abundance of this species in the Gulf of Alaska in recent years and the increasing probability of a fishery developing may necessitate a species-specific management strategy for dogfish in Alaska waters.

AB  - Shrimp trawl fishery has evoked serious concerns at both regional and global levels due to its strong association with the bycatch and its significant contribution to the total global discards. Using three data methods (examination of fishermen log-books, questionnaire survey and observer monitoring), the bycatch and discards associated with shrimp trawl fishery were studied, for two consecutive seasons (2013-2014 and 2014-2015), in the main shrimp fishing ground off Safaniya, along the Saudi coast in the Arabian Gulf. Safaniya fishing ground, with 37 large shrimp trawlers, was found to contribute a total shrimp catch of 500 to 755 t (up to 11% of the total national shrimp landings). Total bycatch (281-563 t) and discard (114-339 t) were substantial. A total of 104 fish and shellfish species were recorded in the bycatch, including 93 Osteichtyes, 3 Chondrichthyes, 6 Crustaceans and 3 Molluscs. The blue swimming crab, Portunus segnis, prevailed the bycatch (145-160 t), followed by the pharaoh cuttlefish Sepia pharaonis (2-16 t). Safaniya shrimp fishery was found to have high impacts on the shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus; target species) juveniles and other commercial species. Estimations of total number of turtles captured in the catch ranged between 1492 and 2018, indicating a serious threat of shrimp fishery on local turtle populations. The results of this study emphasize the urgent need to adopt appropriate bycatch reduction devices in shrimp fishery, in addition to enforcement of fisheries management regulations in order to protect the non-target resources and ensure a sustainable shrimp production in the Arabian Gulf.

AB  - Between October 2018 and October 2019, seven megamouth sharks were reported as bycatch in the small-scale surface and midwater gillnet fisheries operating from the ports of Mancora and Salaverry in northern Peru. Here we present details of these specimens and bycatch events that represent the first documented records of this species in Peruvian waters, confirming their occurrence as fisheries bycatch. We recommend continued monitoring programs in small-scale fisheries toward assessing the extent of this species’ occurrence in Peru and its vulnerability to fishery interactions.

AB  - General declines in the abundance of sharks due to intense exploitation rates have been increasing the pressure for mitigating bycatch mortality in longline fisheries. Understanding post-release mortality and behavior of sharks is required to ensure the adequacy of management strategies focusing on the release of live animals. Also, such information is crucial for addressing shark attack mitigation strategies focusing on mechanisms other than shark culling. This study used a combination of conventional tags with acoustic and satellite transmitters to assess both post-release survival and behavior and exposure to fisheries in tiger sharks caught in a longline survey off Recife, Brazil. Although none of the sharks experienced post-release mortality, one episode of presumable natural mortality occurred after 45days at-liberty. The exposure of tiger sharks to fishing pressure in this region seems to be high since at least 23% of the tiger sharks tagged and released off Recife were caught by coastal and oceanic fisheries, most (83%) of which after only 69 (±42)days at-liberty. Upon release, all satellite-tracked sharks moved offshore to deeper waters, usually in the oceanic realm, within an average of 17.72 (±10.99)h, corresponding to a minimum cross-shelf swimming speed of 0.40 (±0.22)m·s−1. The archival data of 3 recovered satellite tags depicted post-release behaviors with exceptional detail, with all such sharks exhibiting a yo-yo movement pattern with increasing depths until the shelf break was reached. Some sharks consistently spent a period of 12 (±2)days in deep-diving before returning to shallower waters, presumably from the continental shelf, which could correspond to a species-specific behavioral response to hooking stress. Tagged sharks did not return to the area where they were caught and it would be unlikely that they would return before several months because most of them traveled through great distances to northward latitudes. Altogether, tiger sharks caught alive in longline gear seem to experience negligible post-release mortality if they are adequately released, thus an eventual mandatory release of live animals could be effective to improve the conservation of the species. Also, recently-released tiger sharks should not be expected to further interact with the same fishing gear that caught them for some time, or to further pose any threat to beach users in Recife, where an abnormally high shark attack rate is verified since 1992.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges of fisheries research is reducing the bycatch of unwanted species. The incidental fishing mortality of species with low reproductive rates, such as elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays), is recognized as a key threat for their populations. In the present study, gear modifications related to the type of hook and position of the hook in the water column were tested to examine their effects on catch rates and mortality of elasmobranch species in both pelagic and coastal environments. Comparisons between circle (size 18/0, 0° offset) and J-style (size 9/0, 10° offset) hooks demonstrated that the circle hooks have a greater efficiency in reducing the mortality of most species caught, both in pelagic and coastal longline fisheries. Internal lodging of the hook was significantly less frequent for the individuals caught with circle hooks, which likely contributed to their higher survival rate at haulback. Additionally, circle hooks also increased the CPUE of elasmobranchs caught in the pelagic longline fishery, which was particularly evident for Carcharhinus falciformis and Prionace glauca. The position of the hook in the water column exhibited a strong influence on the species caught in the coastal bottom longline fishery. Suspending hooks in the middle of the water column reduced the bycatch of common demersal species, such as Carcharhinus acronotus, Ginglymostoma cirratum, and Dasyatis americana, while increasing the CPUE of potentially aggressive species, such as Galeocerdo cuvier and Carcharhinus leucas. The interaction of the type of hook utilized with its position in the water column appears to be an essential factor in the optimization of longline selectivity and minimization of bycatch mortality.

AB  - Improving the selectivity of the fishing gear is one of the most promising methods to mitigate deleterious impacts of longline fisheries upon bycatch species. Light lures have recently become widespread in epipelagic longline fisheries since they increase the catch rates of valuable target species such as swordfish and tunas. Yet, little is known about their effect upon the incidence of bycatch. Here, we compared the catchability of target and bycatch species in a pelagic longline fishery targeting swordfish and tunas equipped with light attractors with three different colors to ascertain if any of the light attractor colors would enhance the selectivity of the fishing gear. A total of 3488 individuals were caught across 57 fishing sets. The proportion of target species to bycatch species was high (58–65 %) in each color treatment. Overall, green attractors (peak wavelength at 525 nm) exhibited the highest catch rates of target species, but they were also responsible for the highest incidence of bycatch, rendering 73 % and 82 % of the blue shark and sea turtle catch, respectively. Blue (peak wavelength at 465 nm) and white attractors caught significantly less individuals of both target and bycatch species. Further, significant interactions between light attractor color and the intensity of lunar illumination were observed for most species analyzed. Differences in the catchability of bycatch such as blue sharks and white marlins across attractor color treatments were more conspicuous at high lunar illumination levels (i.e. full moon periods), when white attractors rendered the lowest catch of these taxa. In contrast, the catchability of target species such as swordfish, yellowfin tuna and albacore showed greater differences between treatments at low illumination levels (i.e. new moon periods). The observed differences in the performance of the three light attractor colors across the lunar cycle might provide an opportunity to mitigate bycatch incidence in longline fisheries. Yet, further research is required to fully understand the combined effects of light lures and lunar illumination on the behavioral responses of pelagic species.

AB  - This study addressed the influence of hook type (circle vs J-hook) and leader material (nylon vs wire) on longline catch and mortality rates of target and bycatch species in a pelagic longline fishery targeting swordfish, Xiphias gladius, and tunas. A total of 603 individuals (53% classified as bycatch) were caught on 17,000 hooks. Sharks constituted 45% of the bycatch. Bite-offs (i.e. missing hooks) corresponded to ∼33% of the shark catch and occurred mostly on nylon leaders (97%). Hook type had no significant effect on catchability or mortality of any species or groups. However, nylon leaders caught more bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus and all target species combined, while wire leaders caught more blue shark, Prionace glauca and all sharks combined. If bite-offs were assumed to be undetected sharks, differences in shark catchability between leader types disappear. Moreover, significant differences in blue shark catch rate between leader types was found in J-hook treatments only. Higher proportions of live sharks were found on wire leaders. The catch and mortality rates of sharks in longline fisheries may be underestimated when monofilament leaders are used. This study highlights the need for understanding the role of every longline component in gear performance analysis.

AB  - The Bering skate, Bathyraja interrupta, is commonly found in both the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, where skates are a regular bycatch in commercial long line and bottom trawl fisheries. This is the first study to examine the age and growth of B. interrupta, and one of the few studies to directly compare growth parameters of a skate species between management regions. Ages were estimated based on band counts using the standard gross-sectioning method of vertebral centra preparation. Additionally, a preliminary investigation was conducted into the utility of the histological method. Several growth models were compared and the best-fit model for both regions was identified as the logistic model using the Akaike's Information Criterion approach. No significant difference was detected between sexes for any model in either region; however, a slight but significant difference was found between regions. The parameters of the logistic growth model based on the gross-sectioned preparation were L∞=82.80cm TL and k−1yr=0.23 for the eastern Bering Sea and L∞=86.94cm TL and k−1yr=0.20 for the Gulf of Alaska. Age estimates from the gross sectioned vertebral centra provided a minimum longevity of 19 years and 21 years, respectively. Estimates based on the histologically prepared samples provide overall slightly higher age estimates, but the same maximum age of 21 years.

AB  - The blue shark has been subject to bycatch fishing mortality in the western North Atlantic for almost a half-century. Nevertheless, stock status is ambiguous and improved input data are needed for stock assessments. It is particularly important to obtain reliable indices of abundance because of the uncertainty in estimates of bycatch. An index of relative abundance (catch-per-unit effort, CPUE) is developed for western North Atlantic blue sharks, starting from the mid-1950s, when industrial pelagic longline tuna fisheries began. Longline catch and effort records from recent observer programs (1980–1990s) were linked with longline survey records from both historical archives and recent cruises (1950–1990s). Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to remove the effects of diverse fishing target practices, geographical and seasonal variability that affect blue shark catch rates. The analysis revealed a decline in blue shark CPUE of approximately 30% in the western North Atlantic from 1957 to 2000. The magnitude of this CPUE decline was less than other recently published estimates and seems reasonable in light of the high productivity of the blue shark revealed by life-history studies and preliminary stock assessments.

AB  - Large numbers of blue sharks are caught as bycatch, and have even become the target species in pelagic longline fisheries in the North Atlantic Ocean. The status of the stock is ambiguous due to the limitations of the fishery-dependent data. This study presents a spatially structured tagging model to estimate blue shark movement and fishing mortality rates in the North Atlantic Ocean. The model uses the blue shark tag-recovery data collected by the United States National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative Shark Tagging Program (1965–2004). Four major geographical regions (two on each side of the ocean) are assumed. The blue shark fishing mortality rates (F) were found to be heterogeneous across the four regions. While the estimates of F obtained for the western North Atlantic Ocean were historically lower than 0.1 year–1, the F estimates over the most recent decade (1990s) in the eastern side of the ocean are rapidly approaching 0.2 year–1. Because of the particular life-history of the blue shark, these results suggest careful monitoring of the fishery as the juvenile and pregnant female segments of the stock are highly vulnerable to exploitation in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean.

AB  -        The aim of this study  is to investigate the by catch from the Egyptian Mediterranean trawlers off Alexandria during the period from March 2018 and May 2019. The catch per unit effort (CPU) ranged from 4 Kg / hr in autumn to 9 Kg / hr in summer. Invasive species reached 44 in number; 43 species of Red Sea origin and one species of Atlantic Ocean origin.  The by catch was represented by one elasmobranch, 80 boney fishes and 14 invertebrates belonging to 4 phyla; 5 classes; 22 orders and 56 families. Eight families of fish were dominated and constituted the high rank of percentage during the period of investigation. 12 species were prevailing the by catch and constituted the high percentages namely: Spicara smaris (22.575%); Boops boops (12.922 %); Nemipterus randalli (8.943 %); Spicara maena (4.865 %); Synchiropus sechellensis (4.864 %); Diplodus vulgaris (4.504 %); Lepidotrigla cavillone (3. 313 %); Upeneus pori (3.225 %); Pagellus erythrinus (3.192 %); Mullus barbatus (1.804 %); Terapon puta (1.235 %) and Ariosoma balearicum (1.038 %).  Nine species occurred during the four seasons; 18 species were represented during three seasons; 17 species occurred in two seasons, while forty-nine species were represented in one season. The biological studies on the most economical by-catch species showed there were three species belonged to one year of life, eight species had two years of life and one species was found belonging to age group three.

AB  - In the absence of direct consumption importance and considering as low value bycatch, many vulnerable non-target species, especially slow growing deep water fauna, are overlooked in tropical fisheries research and management. The bramble shark Echinorhinus cf. brucus (Bonnaterre, 1788) is one such species, subjected to a significant non-targeted deep water fishery off southern India. A length frequency based stock assessment of bramble shark caught in trawl fisheries from the south-eastern Arabian Sea suggests that, E. cf. brucus is a moderately slow growing (K=0.12 year-1) and moderately long lived shark species (Tmax = 25 years, L¥= 333 at corresponding age of 55 years) which is overexploited (M=0.17, Z=0.39) in the region. In view of resilience capacity and vulnerability of deep sea fisheries, improved research and monitoring programmes are urgently required to ensure a sustainable future for India’s expanding deep-sea and distant water fisheries.

AB  - Conservation and management of chondrichthyans are becoming increasingly important, as many species are particularly vulnerable to fishing activities, primarily as bycatch, which leads to incomplete catch reporting, potentially hiding the impact on these organisms. Here, we aimed at implementing an eDNA metabarcoding approach to reconstruct shark and ray bycatch composition from 24 hauls of a bottom trawl fishing vessel in the central Mediterranean. eDNA samples were collected through the passive filtration of seawater by simple gauze rolls encapsulated in a probe (the “metaprobe”), which already showed great efficiency in detecting marine species from trace DNA in the environment. To improve molecular taxonomic detection, we enhanced the 12S target marker reference library by generating sequences for 14 Mediterranean chondrichthyans previously unrepresented in public repositories. DNA metabarcoding data correctly identifies almost all bycaught species and detected five additional species not present in the net, highlighting the potential of this method to detect rare species. Chondrichthyan diversity showed significant association with some key environmental variables (depth and distance from the coast) and the fishing effort, which are known to influence demersal communities. As DNA metabarcoding progressively positions itself as a staple tool for biodiversity monitoring, we expect that its melding with opportunistic, fishery-dependent surveys could reveal additional distribution features of threatened and elusive megafauna.

AB  - From 1985 to 1999, data were gathered opportunistically on the bycatch of 33 leatherback turtles in coastal Peru, and from 2000 to 2003, a dockside observer program provided data on an additional 133 leatherbacks caught in the coastal gillnet and longline fisheries targeting mahi mahi, sharks, and rays. These data stress the need for programs to monitor bycatch in artisanal fisheries, enforce regulations prohibiting sea turtle capture, and increase the environmental awareness of fishermen.

AB  - 1. Over the last few decades, evidence of marine vertebrate bycatch has been collected for a range of industrial fisheries. It has recently been acknowledged that large impacts may also result from similar interactions with small‐scale fisheries (SSF) due largely to their diffuse effort and large number of vessels in operation. Marine mammals, seabirds, turtles as well as some shark species have been reported as being impacted by SSF worldwide. 2. From 2000 to 2007, we used both shore‐based and onboard observer programmes from three SSF ports in Peru to assess the impact on marine turtles of small‐scale longline, bottom set nets and driftnet fisheries. 3. We reported a total of 807 sea turtles captured, 91·8% of which were released alive. For these three sites alone, we estimated c. 5900 turtles captured annually (3200 loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta, 2400 green turtles Chelonia mydas, 240 olive ridleys Lepidochelys olivacea and 70 leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea). 4. SSF in Peru are widespread and numerous (>100 ports, >9500 vessels, >37 000 fishers), and our observed effort constituted c. 1% of longline and net deployments. We suggest that the number of turtles captured per year is likely to be in the tens of thousands. Thus, the impacts of Peruvian SSF have the potential to severely impact sea turtles in the Pacific especially green, loggerhead and leatherback turtles. 5. Implications of the human use of turtle products as ‘marine bushmeat’ are also raised as an important issue. Although such utilization is illegal, it is difficult to foresee how it can be managed without addressing the constraints to the livelihoods of those depending almost entirely on coastal resources. 6. Syntheses and applications. Our analysis demonstrates that, despite logistical challenges, it is feasible to estimate the bycatch per unit of effort in SSF by combining methods that account for fishing effort and bycatch, such as using onboard and shore‐based observers. We highlight sea turtle bycatch in SSF in the southeast Pacific as a major conservation concern but also suggest possible paths for mitigation.

Biodiversitas 20: 1154-1159. The majority of sharks caught in Indonesian fisheries were bycatch products from the tuna longline fisheries, but some regions in Indonesia fish the sharks as their main target. One of these regions is located in Muncar, Banyuwangi, which fishes the endangered Scalloped Hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) as target species. This research aimed to study the genetic diversity of the endangered Scalloped Hammerhead sharks landed in Muncar Fishing Port, Banyuwangi. Genetic analysis was done through PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA COI (Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I) gene. Out of the 37 samples collected, 30 were successfully amplified and sequenced.The results showed moderate haplotype diversity (Hd: 0,582 ± 0,079) and low nucleotide diversity (π: 0,00392± 0,0024) with five haplotypes (h) and 26 polymorphic sites (S). Tajima’s D neutrality model values indicated a population expansion event. Two different clades were determined through phylogenetic analysis and by GenBank sequences comparison. These results provided basic information and present status of the Scalloped Hammerhead sharks population genetically within the fishing ground (Makassar Strait-Kangean Islands).

AB  - Bycatch of several groups of species and their characteristics are presented for the period 2003 to 2007 for the European purse seine tuna fishery operating in the Atlantic Ocean. Data were collected through French and Spanish observer programmes and represented a total of 27 trips corresponding to 2.9% coverage. Bycatch is defined as non-targeted species and small or damaged target species. Bycatch species composition, main species length, sex ratio and the fate of the most common species are presented first. Stratified ratios relative to landings of major commercial tunas were then used to estimate the total bycatch; these ratios were considered the most appropriate variable for extrapolation. Stratification was based on the fishing mode (free school vs. floating object), season (quarters) and spatial areas. The annual average bycatch was estimated at about 6400 t, corresponding to a mean annual value of 80.8 t per 1000 t of tuna landed or 7.5% of the total catch. Tunas represent 83% (67.2 t/1000 t) of the total bycatch, followed by other bony fishes (10%, 7.8 t/1000 t), billfishes (5%, 4.0 t/1000 t), sharks (1%, 0.9 t/1000 t) and rays (1%, 0.9 t/1000 t). Based on estimates of the annual bycatch, 16% was kept on board and sold in local markets.

AB  - Amandè, M. J., Chassot, E., Chavance, P., Murua, H., Delgado de Molina, A., and Bez, N. 2012. Precision in bycatch estimates: the case of tuna purse-seine fisheries in the Indian Ocean. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: . Estimating bycatch, i.e. the incidental catch of non-target marine animals and undersized individuals of target species, by raising observer data to the whole fishery is routine practice. The annual bycatch of the European tropical tuna purse-seine fishery over the period 2003–2009 was estimated at 11 590 t [95% confidence interval: (8165–15 818 t)], corresponding to 4.7% of the tuna landings. An analysis of the variability in the precision of this estimate, based on generalized linear models and Monte Carlo simulations, showed that the current sampling coverage of the tropical tuna fishery observer programme, which is 4.6% of the fishing trips, resulted in large uncertainties in bycatch estimates by species, i.e. none of the estimates have a relative root mean square error smaller than 50%. Although the overall magnitude of bycatch of the fishery appeared to be small, the current sampling coverage was insufficient to give any reliable estimate for low-occurring species, such as marine turtles, some oceanic pelagic sharks, and some billfishes. Increasing the sampling coverage would likely improve bycatch estimates. Simulation outputs were produced to help define (i) trade-offs between the priority species to be monitored, (ii) the estimation precision, (iii) expected accuracy, and (iv) the associated sampling costs.

AB  - Fishing activities conducted on seagrass bed to capture fishes and other seagrass associated fauna are very massive especially in the Pacific regions and undeveloped countries. This is due to the high abundance of economically important species associated to seagrasses, and additionally, seagrass area is the most accessible fishing ground throughout the year and with low capital. Seagrass meadows are importance habitat to support an abundance and diverse fish assemblages that form the basis for artisanal fisheries, which are vital in maintaining food security of coastal community in the regions. The seagrass fishery is considered a small-scale, multi-species and multi-gear fisheries. One of the fishing gear used in this fishery is traditional permanent fish trap called “sero”. Bycatch from some small-scale fisheries have been reported such as from trawls, traps, gill nets, and longline fisheries. This study aimed to identify bycatch species from “sero”, a type of seagrass fisheries which is in the form of fish fences with nets positioned on intertidal area of seagrass bed to the subtidal for approximately 200m. The result shown the bycatch from this fisheries was dominated by either low value fishes or invaluable and even toxic fishes for consumption, such as the puffers (Tetraodontidae and Diodontidae), juveniles of Apogonidae and Chaetodontidae. Additionally, sharks, turtles, and rays were also found in the bycatch. This result should be put into consideration as the bycatch would have an ecological consequences on the population, predator-prey relationship, and ecosystem resilience to stressor in general. Information from this study will be important for sustainable small-scale fisheries management and seagrass conservation, and therefore, further research into bycatch reduction in this fishery would be desirable.

AB  - Carcharhinus melanopterus in the southern waters of the Makassar Strait is caught with bottom longlines and bottom gill nets as bycatch, caught throughout the year without any management arrangements. The research objective was to obtain information about the size structure and sex ratio of C. melanopterus in the southern waters of the Makassar Strait. The method used is a survey method. Sample measurements were carried out at TPI Paotere Makassar City and TPI Beba Takalar Regency, South Sulawesi Province from July to September 2020. Measurement of total body length (TL:cm) and determining the sex ratio were carried out directly in the field. The results of the study on 144 sample fish showed that the total length range for C. melanopterus landed at the Paotere TPI was the same as those landed at the Beba TPI at sizes between 58 - 135 cm TL with an average length of 91.18 ± 3.32 cm TL and sizes between 51 - 139 cm TL with an average length of 91.1±2.21 cm TL for both male and female sex, respectively.The comparison of C. melanopterus landed in the two fish landing sites was in a balanced state but the male sex was smaller than the female sex.The sex ratio of male and female C. melanopterus is balanced. Most (69.44%) female C. melanopterus caught were relatively young.

AB  - This paper reports the results of using different hook style and bait type combinations on the catches of targeted, bycatch and discarded fishes in the Portuguese commercial longline fishery targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the South Atlantic Ocean. In total, 310 longline experimental sets (446 400 hooks) were deployed between October 2008 and February 2012. Three different hook styles were tested; the traditional J‐hook (9/0) 10o offset was compared with two 17/0 circle hooks (a non‐offset and a 10o offset), and squid (Illex spp.) bait was compared with mackerel (Scomber spp.). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated for each fish species per fishing set and compared between the different hook style and bait type combinations. Results indicated that the effects of hook style and bait on the CPUEs were species‐specific. For example, swordfish (target species, Xiphias gladius) CPUEs were higher with J‐hooks baited with squid, while for the blue shark (most important bycatch species, Prionace glauca) the highest CPUEs were obtained with circle hooks baited with mackerel. For tuna (Thunnus spp.) and marlin (blue, Makaira nigricans and white, Kajikia albida) only the bait effect was significant, with higher catches with squid. For the discarded species, the proportions of alive vs dead specimens at the time of fishing gear retrieval were also species‐specific. The total retained catch value per unit of effort (VPUE) did not changed between the different hook and bait combinations, but these VPUEs are highly dependent on market fluctuations.

Sampling was conducted from September 20 to October 23, in 2006. In this survey, we collected shark data to obtain the ratio of fin weight to body weight of sharks. Overall, 413 sharks belonging to 9 species were caught on 62,464 hooks. The total weight of the sharks caught was 11,093 kg. The ratio of wet fin weight to body round weight of sharks by species ranged from 3.7% to 7.7%, while the mean was 5.4%. The total ratio of wet fin weight to the dry fin weight of sharks ranged 0.38 to 0.70 and the mean value was 0.53. The ratio of dry fin weight to the body round weight of the sharks was estimated to be 2.86%.

AB  - Since 2004, governments and non-governmental organizations, together with the fishing communities from nine countries, from Mexico to Peru, have implemented joint efforts to reduce incidental mortality of sea turtles in artisanal longline fisheries of the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). These countries are involved in a Regional Sea Turtle Bycatch Program to achieve this goal. Circle hooks have been proposed as a way to mitigate incidental mortality of sea turtles. Thus, we analyze the performance of circle hooks in relation to J-style and tuna hooks on the hooking rates of target and non-target species in the artisanal surface longline fisheries of three of the participating countries with the largest sample sizes (Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica). These fisheries target mahi-mahi, Coryphaena hippurus, or a combination of tunas, billfishes and sharks (TBS), and use different techniques and gear configurations to catch their targets. For the TBS fishery we presented the results of comparisons between tuna hooks and 16/0 circle hooks from Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica, and between tuna hooks and 18/0 circle hooks in Costa Rica. For the mahi-mahi fishery, we analyzed the performance of 14/0 and 15/0 circle hooks in Ecuadorian vessels and 16/0 circle hooks in Costa Rican vessels vs. the traditional J-style hooks. A total of 730,362 hooks were observed in 3126 sets. Hooking rates for target and non-target species were not consistent for all fisheries and countries analyzed. However, circle hooks reduced sea turtle hooking rates in most of the comparisons.

AB  - The Falkland Islands conduct one of the few targeted skate fisheries in the world with total annual catches of several thousand tonnes.  This bottom trawl fishery is characterized by relatively low catch volumes and product yield that challenge commercial profitability. Recently, one Falkland Islands fishing company acquired a large proportion of the skate ITQ, and to optimise its fishing operations, proposed a research collaboration with the Falkland Islands Fisheries Department for assessing the performance of trawls equipped with either standard 110 mm codend mesh, or larger 300 and 400 mm meshes. The results of the trial confirmed the efficiency of larger mesh codends to decrease finfish bycatch by 97–98%. Additionally, trawls with 400 mm mesh significantly decreased the bycatch of commercially valueless small skates that would experience high discard mortality. As a result of the trial, the Falkland Islands Government implemented a regulatory licence condition of 400 mm codend mesh for targeted skate fishing. Besides greater production efficiency, vessel operators are incentivized by possible wider access throughout the fishing zone. Further initiatives are anticipated to develop management measures by individual species, continue improving conservation through bycatch mitigation in all fisheries, and diversify Falklands skate products in global markets.

AB  - We constructed a mass-balanced model of a benthic ecosystem exploited by shrimp trawlers in the Gulf of California, Mexico. The model is based on the software ecopath with ecosim Version 4a, which takes into account the contribution of functional groups to bycatch. The model represents the state of the ecosystem in 1978–79, and reflects the exploitation rate of shrimp at that time. We included 27 groups in the model: aquatic birds, marine mammals, shark/rays, 11 groups of teleost fish, five macrocrustaceans, two macromolluscs, polychaetes, meiobenthos, zooplankton, phytoplankton, detritus and dead fish. With respect to the bycatch, it was assumed that fish died on-board the trawlers while macroinvertebrates were returned to the sea alive. The macroinvertebrates would become more vulnerable to predation as a result of this practice but we assumed that this effect would be reflected in diets. The most important families of fish in the bycatch were Haemulidae, Serranidae, Paralichthydae, accounting for 75% of the total fish catch. These families include important shrimp predators, suggesting that fish mortality in the bycatch could have a positive impact on the shrimp stock. Total system throughput was up 4000 t km-2 year-1; total consumption 52%; flows to respiration 40%; and flows to detritus 7%. The total system production was almost equal to its consumption as was net primaty production to respiration. It is suggested that ecosystem efficiency was relatively low. Ecosystem overhead was 2.4 times the Ascendency, indicating that the shrimp-trawl ecosystem was in a develope stage, probably as a result of fishing. Because a decrease in biomass causes a loss of Ascendency, it is hypothesized that the previous state of the ecosystem (unexploited or with low exploitation rate) was more developed, and probably had a higher production.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment is a useful methodology for assisting the management of fisheries from an ecosystem perspective. Atlantic tuna fisheries, managed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), are economically important and interact with several bycatch species. In spite of these interactions, no comprehensive ecological risk assessment has been conducted for bycatch species caught in ICCAT fisheries. In this paper, we followed a two stage approach with the objective of assessing the relative risk of species being negatively impacted by Atlantic tuna fisheries. An analysis of the ICCAT bycatch species list (which includes all species reported to have interacted with different tuna fishing gears operating in the Atlantic) revealed that most of these species are caught in longline fisheries, followed by gillnets and purse seines. According to the IUCN red list, 7 species of the ICCAT bycatch list (3 coastal sharks, 3 sea turtles and one seabird) are categorized as critically endangered. In our study, and based on their life history characteristics, marine mammals and coastal sharks caught in ICCAT fisheries showed the highest intrinsic vulnerability values. A productivity susceptibility analysis for the European Union (EU) tropical tuna purse seine fleet and the United States (US) pelagic longline fleet revealed two groups with high relative risk scores. The first one included pelagic and coastal sharks, characterized by relatively low productivities, and the second one included teleosts, characterized by higher productivities but high susceptibility to purse seine and longline gears. Some alternative approaches to conduct productivity susceptibility analyses in the context of ecological risk assessments are discussed.

AB  - The mid-water multiday trawl fishery along the north-west coast of India generally targets adult largehead hairtail, Trichiurus lepturus. Bycatch landed by the commercial mid-water multiday trawlers operated from Veraval harbor during August 2017–December 2019 was investigated by analyzing catch composition with respect to its spatial and temporal patterns. A total of 834 bycatch sample observations from mid-water trawl fishery were examined. Bycatch comprises of 123 species and account for 53.36% of the total catch. Highest composition in bycatch comprises of teleosts (62.09%), cephalopods (35.88%), crustaceans (1.47%) and elasmobranchs (0.56%) respectively. Uroteuthis duvaucelii, Sepia elliptica, Nemipterus japonicus, Otolithes cuvieri, S. pharaonis, Priacanthus hamrur, Sepiella inermis and Saurida tumbil were the dominant species with high annual average catches; and together contributed 50.30% of total bycatch. Discards formed 6.32% of total catch and consisted of 62 species belonging to 29 families. The most common discards were juveniles of S. tumbil, N. japonicus, Platycephalus indicus, O. cuvieri, Johnius glaucus and T. lepturus. CPUE of bycatch differed significantly between the seasons with the lowest being in summer and highest in post-monsoon period. Minimum bycatch rates were observed in the offshore waters than inshore waters. Endangered, Threatened and Protected (ETP) species listed in CITES as well as IUCN were also observed. The present study revealed that quantities of bycatch landed off northwest coast of India in the Arabian Sea were relatively higher than that landed by mid-water trawlers operating in other parts of the world. Hence the mid-water trawl fishery operating in north-west coast of India and targeting largehead hairtail needs to be closely monitored to mitigate and reduce the quantity of bycatch landed by them.

AB  - The southern banded guitarfish, Zapteryx xyster, and the Velez ray, Raja velezi, are two endemic elasmobranchs in the eastern Tropical Pacific that are commonly caught by the bottom-trawl fishery. Reproductive cycles of these batoids were inferred from the hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indexes (males and females) and the oviductal gland width and the yolk follicle diameter (females) of mature specimens collected along the Pacific of Costa Rica between 2010 and 2011. Z. xyster females have a partially defined annual cycle with one reproductive peak in June and July, with most neonates and gravid females occurring during December and January (beginning of the dry season). The gestation period of Z. xyster can range between four and six months; males are probably capable of mating continuously throughout the year. Females and males of R. velezi have a continuous reproductive cycle with no clear peaks. Management and conservation measures of these batoids should consider their reproductive ecology, which may be linked to the degree of vulnerability to fishing. Based on our findings, we recommend reducing fishing pressure when mating (June-July) and pupping (December-January) of Z. xyster occur. In contrast, a reduction of fishing pressure on previously identified nursery grounds of R. velezi in the southern Pacific of Costa Rica may benefit their population.

AB  - Elasmobranchs are an important bycatch component in Portuguese artisanal fisheries, but there are no management or monitoring programs in place yet. This study analysed elasmobranch catches in a Portuguese west coast trammel net fishery. Thirty-seven sampling surveys were conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels on a seasonal basis between October 2004 and August 2005. A total of 11 elasmobranch species were caught (seven Rajiformes, two Torpediniformes and two Carchariniformes), representing 4% of total catches and 15% of total weight. Raja clavata was the most important species in number (7.4ind 10,000m−1 of net) and Raja undulata the most important in weight (8512.4g 10,000m−1 of net). Discards represented 7.8% of total catch in weight, but 24.8% in number of specimens caught. Seven elasmobranch species were commonly discarded. There was a marked seasonality in elasmobranch catches, with lowest species richness registered in spring (four species) and highest in autumn (11 species). For the most abundant species depth range preferences were assessed.

AB  - One‐third of all elasmobranch species currently known to occur in Papua New Guinea are taken as bycatch in the Gulf of Papua trawl fishery. An ecological risk assessment was conducted on the 16 species of sharks and 23 species of rays caught by the fishery. Eight species were classified to be at low risk, 28 species were at medium risk while three species – Rhynchobatus palpebratus (eyebrow wedgefish), Carcharhinus coatesi (Australian blackspot shark) and Maculabatis astra (blackspotted whipray), all endemic to New Guinea and northern Australia – faced the highest level of risk from the fishery at current fishing levels. There is potential for more vessels to enter the fishery in future, which is likely to elevate the risk for a greater proportion of elasmobranch species. Ongoing monitoring of bycatch levels, supported by biological and ecological studies on frequently caught species, is required to assess and manage risk in the future. The development and use of trawl excluder devices or bycatch reduction devices in this fishery have the potential to reduce bycatch levels and reduce risk levels.

AB  - Coastal sharks with small body sizes may be among the most productive species of chondrichthyans. The Australian sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon taylori) is one of the most productive members of this group based on work in northern and eastern Australia. However, life history information throughout the remainder of its range is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, the age, growth and maturity of R. taylori caught in the Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery in Papua New Guinea, were studied. One hundred and eighty six individuals, comprising 131 females (31-66 cm TL) and 55 males (31-53 cm TL) were aged using vertebral analysis and growth was modelled using a multi-model approach. The lack of small individuals close to the size at birth made fitting of growth curves more difficult, two methods (fixed length at birth and additional zero aged individuals) accounting for this were trialled. The von Bertalanffy growth model provided the best fit to the data when used with a fixed length-at-birth (L0 = 26 cm TL). Males (L∞ = 46 cm TL, k = 3.69 yr-1, L50 = 41.7 cm TL and A50 = 0.5 years) grew at a faster rate and matured at smaller sizes and younger ages than females (L∞ = 58 cm TL, k = 1.98 yr-1, L5o = 47.0 cm TL and A50 = 0.93 years). However, none of the methods to account for the lack of small individuals fully accounted for this phenomenon, and hence the results remain uncertain. Despite this, the results reaffirm the rapid growth of this species and suggest that the Gulf of Papua population may grow at a faster rate than Australian populations. Rhizoprionodon taylori is possibly well placed to withstand current fishing pressure despite being a common bycatch species in the Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery. However, further research needs to be undertaken to estimate other key life history parameters to fully assess the population status of this exploited shark species and its vulnerability to fishing in the Gulf of Papua.

AB  - Incidental catch or bycatch represents a significant threat for the conservation of seabird populations. The western Mediterranean is an important fishing area where the Spanish pelagic and semi-pelagic longline fleet targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius), bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and albacore (Thunnus alalunga) operates. Bycatch of these fisheries includes several seabird species. Given the importance of conservation of the bycatch species (marine mammals, turtles, sharks and seabirds), an on-board observer program was implemented by the Spanish Oceanographic Institute (IEO); this included collecting data on effort and catch, as well as weight and number of individuals of the main bycatch species. The aim of the present study is to report data on seabird bycatch collected by the on-board observer program of the IEO in the Western Mediterranean. Data on seabird bycatch were collected for the period 2000-2008, throughout the year. Six longline gears targeting large pelagic fish were identified operating in the area of study, but only three had an effect on seabird species. Differences in catch per unit effort (CPUE, birds per 1000 hooks) for each gear, as well as their effect on particular seabird species, are reported in this study. A total of 4 786 466 hooks were monitored, which yielded 182 seabirds belonging to 7 different species. The average CPUE for the studied period was 0.038 birds per 1000 hooks. Cory’s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) and yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) were the species the most highly represented in the catch. In contrast, Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) was only present in the longline fishery targeting albacore (CPUE = 0.005 birds per 1000 hooks). Our results suggest that Cory’s shearwater is the species the most affected by the longline fishery in the Western Mediterranean, probably due to its biological characteristics, and corroborate the well-established downward trend in its population.

AB  - Night sharks Carcharhinus signatus have suffered large declines in the western Atlantic Ocean, and while fishing mortality has slowed and populations stabilized in the northwestern Atlantic, they are still captured in high numbers as a targeted and bycatch species in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Considered one of the top five most vulnerable stocks in the Atlantic pelagic longline fishery, few records exist for this large-bodied species in the western Caribbean, and nothing is known about their movements or migration in the region. We found that mature night sharks occur in the western Caribbean from March through November and juveniles contribute to artisanal fisheries in the Guatemalan Caribbean. A seasonal aggregation of night sharks occurs at Glover’s Reef Atoll, Belize, in the summer months, possibly for mating purposes, making this a potentially important site for the species. We also document the first recapture of a tagged night shark in the western Caribbean, a subadult male that was tagged in northern Belize and recaptured after c. 60 days off Havana, Cuba. This recapture suggests that individuals undergo large scale movements, and coupled with known threats from fisheries, a regional approach for this species’ management is favored.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries can greatly impact threatened marine fauna. Peru's small-scale elasmobranch gillnet fishery captures thousands of sharks and rays each year, and incidentally captures sea turtles, marine mammals and seabirds. We assessed the ability of a dedicated fisheries remote electronic monitoring (REM) camera to identify and quantify captures in this fishery by comparing its performance to on-board observer reports. Cameras were installed across five boats with a total of 228 fishing sets monitored. Of these, 169 sets also had on-board fisheries observers present. The cameras were shown to be an effective tool for identifying catch, with >90% detection rates for 9 of 12 species of elasmobranchs caught. Detection rates of incidental catch were more variable (sea turtle=50%; cetacean=80%; pinniped=100%). The ability to quantify target catch from camera imagery degraded for fish quantities exceeding 15 individuals. Cameras were more effective at quantifying rays than sharks for small catch quantities (x≤15 fish), whereas size affected camera performance for large catches (x>15 fish). Our study showed REM to be effective in detecting and quantifying elasmobranch target catch and pinniped bycatch in Peru's small-scale fishery, but not, without modification, in detecting and quantifying sea turtle and cetacean bycatch. We showed REM can provide a time- and cost-effective method to monitor target catch in small-scale fisheries and can be used to overcome some deficiencies in observer reports. With modifications to the camera specifications, we expect performance to improve for all target catch and bycatch species.

AB  - Catch rates were compared between gillnets with and without bait in the Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides (Walbaum) fishery off Baffin Island, Canada. Two different types of baiting techniques were compared: bait bags where squid were placed into 2‐mm mesh bags, and tied bait where squid were tied into meshes. Both types of baited gillnets significantly increased the capture of the target species, Greenland halibut, with increases of 253.8% and 149.7% for the bait bag and tied bait, respectively. Common bycatch species showed mixed effects, with roughhead grenadier Macrourus berglax Lacépède showing no increase in catch per unit effort (CPUE) for either bait type (p > 0.05), and porcupine crab Neolithodes grimaldii (Milne‐Edwards and Bouvier) only had a higher CPUE with baited gillnets when bait bags were placed on the footrope. Less common bycatch species—but with threatened populations—showed an increase in CPUE, including Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus (Bloch and Schneider) and Northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus Krøyer. Baiting gillnets affected the CPUE of gillnets in the Greenland halibut fishery, and management should consider how the increased CPUE of both target and bycatch species are affected by this new fishery trend.

AB  - Underwater video recordings in the mouth of a squid trawl were used to evaluate the effectiveness of a trawl configured with drop-chain groundgear to catch longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii) and reduce bycatch of finfish in the Nantucket Sound squid fishery off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA. Entrance through the trawl mouth or escape underneath the fishing line and between drop chains was quantified for targeted squid, and two major bycatch species, summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) and skates (family Rajidae). Additionally, contact and impingement between animals and groundgear were also quantified. Fish and squid swimming behaviours, positions, orientations, and time in the trawl mouth were quantified and related to capture or escape at the trawl mouth. Squid entered the trawl singly and in schools, and no squid were observed escaping under the fishing line. Most squid entered the trawl in the upper portion of the trawl mouth; mantle orientated away from the trawl and swimming in the same direction, and were gradually overtaken, not actively attempting to escape. Summer flounder and skates were observed to remain on or near the seabed, orientated, and swimming in the same direction as the approaching trawl. The majority (60.5%) of summer flounder entered the trawl above the fishing line. Summer flounder that changed their orientation and turned 180° were significantly more likely to enter the trawl (p < 0.05). Most skates (89.7%) avoided trawl entrance and escaped under the fishing line. Neither squid nor summer flounder were observed to make contact or become impinged to the groundgear; however, 35.4% of skates had substantial contact with groundgear, with 12.3% becoming impinged. Video analysis results showed that the drop-chain trawl is effective at retaining targeted squid while allowing skates to escape. However, it is ineffective at avoiding the capture of summer flounder.

AB  - Many US states have recreational and commercial fisheries that occur in nursery areas occupied by subadult sharks and can potentially affect their survival. Georgia is one of few US states without a directed commercial shark fishery, but the state has a large, nearshore penaeid shrimp trawl fishery in which small sharks occur as bycatch. During our 1995–1998 investigation of bycatch in fishery‐dependent sampling events, 34% of 127 trawls contained sharks. This bycatch totalled 217 individuals from six species, with Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Richardson), the most common and finetooth shark, Carcharhinus isodon (Müller & Henle) and spinner shark, Carcharhinus brevipinna (Müller & Henle), the least common. The highest catch rates for sharks occurred during June and July and coincided with the peak months of the pupping season for many species. Trawl tow speed and tow time did not significantly influence catch rates for shark species. Gear configurations [net type, turtle excluder device (TED), bycatch reduction device] affected catch rates for shark species. Results of this study indicate gear restrictions, a delayed season opening, or reduced bar spacing on TEDs may reduce shark bycatch in this fishery.

AB  - The North-East Atlantic porbeagle (Lamna nasus) population has declined dramatically over the last few decades and is currently classified as 'Critically Endangered'. As long-lived, apex predators, they may be vulnerable to bioaccumulation of contaminants. In this study organohalogen compounds and trace elements were analysed in 12 specimens caught as incidental bycatch in commercial gillnet fisheries in the Celtic Sea in 2011. Levels of organohalogen contaminants were low or undetectable (summed CB and BDE concentrations 0.04-0.85 mg kg(-1)wet weight). A notably high Cd concentration (7.2 mg kg(-1)wet weight) was observed in one mature male, whereas the range observed in the other samples was much lower (0.04-0.26 mg kg(-1)wet weight). Hg and Pb concentrations were detected only in single animals, at 0.34 and 0.08 mg kg(-1)wet weight, respectively. These contaminant levels were low in comparison to other published studies for shark species.

AB  - Reliable estimates of mortality have been a major gap in our understanding of population ecology for marine animals. This is especially true for juveniles, which are often the most vulnerable age class and whose survival can strongly influence population growth. Thousands of pop‐up archival satellite tags (PAT) have been deployed on a variety of marine species, but analysis of these data has mainly been restricted to movement ecology and post‐handling survival following fisheries bycatch. We used PAT data to provide empirical estimates of annual survival and cause‐specific mortality for juveniles of a marine top predator. We tagged and tracked juvenile white sharks in the north eastern Pacific Ocean to (1) estimate survival rates and competing risks and (2) investigate intrinsic and environmental influences on mortality risk. We also evaluated the use of PAT data with respect to meeting assumptions of known‐fate survival models. Annual juvenile survival rate was 0.632 (SE = 0.15) and annual natural mortality rate (0.08, SE = 0.06) was lower than the rate of gillnet interactions (0.48, SE = 0.15). Mortality risk decreased with greater body length and was significantly greater (hazard ratio = 9.05, SE = 0.70) for juvenile sharks in Mexican waters, relative to California waters. The PAT data allowed for unambiguous determination of fate in most cases, aided by collaborative relationships with fishers and secondary tags deployed on a subset of sharks. Although caution must be exercised to establish whether assumptions are met, our work demonstrates that PAT data represent a widely available, untapped data source that could dramatically increase our understanding of marine population ecology. Synthesis and applications. Our research shows fisheries bycatch to be the main source of mortality for juvenile white sharks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, highlighting the need for best practices, such as releasing sharks quickly following incidental capture. Furthermore, mortality risk for juveniles was greater in Mexican waters, such that survival may be lower in colder years when juveniles are likely to move south seeking warmer water. This could increase stochasticity in juvenile survival and negatively influence population growth for this apex predator.

AB  - We investigated the performance of a large mesh faced (upper and lower wings, side panels, first bottom belly) bottom trawl designed to capture haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) while reducing the bycatch of cod (Gadus morhua) and other species. This experimental net, named the Eliminator Trawl™, was tested using two vessels, F/V Iron Horse and F/V Sea Breeze, in side-by-side catch comparison hauls with the currently regulated net. A total of 100 successful comparison tows were completed. All species captured were weighed for total weight. Haddock, cod, and the majority of the flounders were measured. The Eliminator Trawl™ significantly reduced the catch of stocks of concern including cod, yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). Other species such as monkfish (Lophius americanus) and skate (unclassified) also showed a significant decrease in catch in the Eliminator Trawl™. In addition, the catch of haddock, the target species, did not differ significantly between nets. The results of this study indicate that the Eliminator Trawl™ would be an efficient tool in gaining access to closed areas and used in recovery programs to exploit more abundant fish species. Examples in the Northeast USA include a B Days-at-Sea Program (DAS) as well as a Special Access Program (SAP) where the Eliminator Trawl™ appears to meet the minimum bycatch requirements to be considered for both these programs.

AB  - A longline experiment consisting of 45 paired sets (90 sets total) was carried out to evaluate a technique which maintains target catch rates while reducing non-target catch rates. Control sets were compared to experimental sets which eliminates the shallowest hooks (∼less than 100m depth). Researchers hypothesized that by eliminating shallow hooks, target catch of deeper dwelling species such as bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) would be maximized while incidental catch of many other non-target, but marketable epi-pelagic species (e.g. billfish), bycatch (discards) of other fishes and elasmobranchs, and protected sea turtles and marine mammals would be simultaneously reduced. To control for differences in fishing power, gear, and deployment techniques; a single vessel was contracted to perform all 90 paired longline sets (45 experimental sets using no-shallow-hooks and 45 control sets using standard methods). Control sets consisted of longlines that were suspended by floats on typical 30m long floatlines in catenary-type shapes that fished a range of depths, determined by temperature–depth recorders (TDRs) to be 44–211m (27.5–11.2°C). By contrast, elimination of shallow hooks in the upper 100m of the water column (hereinafter referred to as experimental sets) was achieved by suspending the fishing portion of the mainline on 75-m long, 3kg weighted vertical sections of mainline suspended by floats on 30m floatlines. As determined by TDRs, this arrangement ensured that all hooks fished at depths >100m (103–248m; 24.8–11.3°C). Thirty percent of hooks in control sets fished at depths less than 100m while all hooks on experimental gear fished greater than 100m. Because many factors influence catchability, longline sets are by nature multivariate, and statistical comparisons were made between the two set types using canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Except for the depth of shallow hooks, operational characteristics between experimental and control sets were the same. The catch rates of bigeye tuna were similar on the two sets types but the catch rate of sickle pomfret (Taractichthys steindachneri) was significantly higher (p=0.011) in the experimental sets as compared to control sets. However, statistically fewer wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri, p=0.019), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus, p=0.008), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans, p=0.001), striped marlin (Kajikia audax, p=0.018) and shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris, p=0.006) were captured on the experimental sets; thus longline interactions and impacts on these species were reduced with the experimental gear. The reason for the differences in catch rates between gear types is likely due to the vertical habitat preferences of the species involved; interactions with epi-pelagic species with shallow distributions in the uniform mixed layer were reduced by deploying hooks greater than 100m. By logical extension, the experimental gear will also likely reduce interactions with sea turtles. Except for additional lead weights, floats, and floatlines, only slight modification of existing longline fishing gear and methods were required to deploy the experimental gear. The main drawback of this method was the increase in time to both deploy (≈0.5h) and retrieve (≈2h) the gear. Knowledge of species vertical distribution patterns can play an important role in modifying fishing gear to reduce bycatch and can also assist managers in regulating fishing practices with a higher degree of likelihood of predicting catch rates and species captured in different gear types.

AB  - A subadult female loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) was caught in a trawl net off the west coast of Florida with a spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) spine lodged in the left stifle. Surgical removal of the spine was performed and antibiotic treatment was initiated. Four weeks later, endoscopy revealed a second spine entering an intestinal lumen. The fistulous tract of the left prefemoral fossa was surgically excised and the intestinal perforation was repaired. Dehiscence occurred and a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system was used on the wound for approximately 18 days to help reduce infection and increase the rate of healing. The left stifle wound was treated to heal by second intention. The turtle remained in rehabilitation for 19 mo before being released off the west coast of Florida. This case describes stingray envenomation injuries as a complex and potentially life-threatening bycatch effect to sea turtles caught in trawl nets.

AB  - Bycatch of trawl fishery is a global concern and batoid fishes, including skates, rays and guitar fishes, are caught frequently as non-targeted species in commercial trawl fishery of India. While the commercial batoid species are documented separately in fishery data, a large number of non-commercial species do not form part of fishery data, even though many such species are listed as ‘Data Deficient’ in IUCN red list. A survey was conducted from July 2018 to June 2019 in the major harbours and landing centresof the south coasts of India to monitor the non-commercial batoid species in the trawl bycatch. Massive landings of non-commercial batoid species such as Torpedo sinuspersici, Narcine cf maculata, Orbiraja powelli Acroteriobatus variegatus and the occasional occurrence of Dipturus johannisdavisi, Benthobatis moresbyi, Narcine timlei and Plesiobatis daviesi have been recorded, besides the juveniles, sub-adults and few adults of commercial species Rhinobatos annandalei, Brevitrygon imbricata and Neotrygon indica from south India. The non-commercial batoids mainly inhabit continental shelf and slope regions of Indian coast where fishing pressure and efforts are high. When these k-selected species live in fishing zones with intense fishing pressure, data deficient species of batoids should be considered as threatened, and this paper discuss challenges in the sector, and forwards strategies for conserving non-targeted batoids.

AB  - The biology of elasmobranchs makes them very vulnerable to fishing pressure and there is increasing international concern over their exploitation. In northern Australia the stocks of some species may be shared with those in southern Indonesia. Indonesia has the highest landings of elasmobranchs worldwide (>100,000 t p.a.) and millions of Indonesian artisanal fishers rely heavily on elasmobranchs taken in target fisheries. They are also taken by industrial trawlers and as bycatch in pelagic tuna fisheries. This paper, resulting from a collaborative project between Australia and Indonesia, summarises the elasmobranch fisheries; the characteristics of the fisheries are outlined, the status of the stocks are assessed, and management options described and discussed. The project focussed on representative markets and fish landing sites in southern Indonesia from 2001 to 2005. Data were from market surveys, the records of the Indonesian Directorate General of Capture Fisheries, and from research cruises. Data from the ongoing tuna monitoring programme showed that shark bycatch from the tuna fleets forms about 11% of shark landings in Indonesia. Yield per recruit and related analyses were used to integrate biological information to indicate the productivity of each species to allow for management policy options and constraints. Research cruise data show that catch rates of elasmobranchs in the Java Sea declined by at least one order of magnitude between 1976 and 1997. The results indicate strongly that many of the shark and ray species in Indonesia are overfished and that the most effective management strategy may need to involve capacity control, such as licencing, gear restrictions and catch limits, together with controls on the fin trade.

AB  - Nursery areas are essential habitats for sharks, offering protection and increasing the survival of newborns. We conducted interviews with local fishers and collected data from artisanal fishery landings between January 2013 and December 2019 to investigate Chetumal Bay as a nursery area for the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) in the Mesoamerican Reef region. The bull shark is a coastal euryhaline shark that inhabits temperate and tropical waters worldwide. In the Mexican Caribbean, bull sharks are caught mainly as bycatch in a multi-specific artisanal fishery using nylon bottomset gillnets, longlines, and hand lines. We record 63 bull sharks in the catches ranging from 67 to 125 cm TL corresponding to immature individuals, 23 neonates with either open or healing umbilical scars (67 and 78 cm TL), and 40 YOY with present but healed umbilical scars (79 to 125 cm TL), with a notable absence of large size juveniles and adults in the catches. Bull sharks were present in landings between May and November; the highest abundance was during July. Our data provide evidence to recognize Chetumal Bay as a nursery area for bull sharks, meeting all the criteria proposed to identify nursery areas. These findings constitute the first documented evidence of a bull shark nursery area in an estuary within the Mexican Caribbean as well as within the entire region of the Mesoamerican Reef System. Moreover, we discuss the importance of this nursery in light of a newly described distinct lineage of bull sharks in Chetumal Bay.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is recognised as a global threat to vulnerable marine megafauna and historical data can contribute to quantify the magnitude of the impact. Here, we present a collection of three datasets generated between 2006 and 2019 by a monitoring programme on marine megafauna bycatch in one of the main Italian fisheries, the northern central Adriatic midwater pair trawl fishery. The three datasets consist of: (i) monitored fishing effort; (ii) bycatch and biological data of dolphins, sea turtles and elasmobranchs; (iii) and dolphin sightings. Some information included in these datasets has already proved to provide a unique opportunity to estimate total incidental capture of species of conservation concern and trends of their relative abundance over time in the northern - central Adriatic Sea. These datasets are expected to be considered by different end users to improve the conservation of species and fishery management approaches to assess the impact of a fishery on species of conservation concern.

AB  - Elasmobranchs are among the most threatened long-lived marine species worldwide, and incidental capture is a major source of mortality. The northern central Adriatic Sea, though one of the most overfished basins of the Mediterranean Sea, supports a very valuable marine biodiversity, including elasmobranchs. This study assesses the impact of the northern central Adriatic pelagic trawl fishery on common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), common eagle ray (Myliobatis aquila), and pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2015. The distribution of bycatch events was evaluated using geo-referenced data. Generalized Linear Models were computed to standardize the catch of the four species and to predict the relative abundance of bycatch events. Data analysis shows that most bycatch events involving all four species occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The models predicted significant, distinct temporal patterns of standardized catches in line with previous investigations. Water depth, season, and fishing region were the best predictors to explain bycatch events. The present data suggest that the northern Adriatic may be an important nursery area for several elasmobranchs. They also highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the interactions between elasmobranchs and fisheries to develop and apply suitable, ad hoc management measures.

AB  - Sea turtle bycatch in commercial fisheries is a serious global problem. An estimated 250,000 loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) sea turtles are taken each year as incidental catch by the pelagic longline fishing industry. Studies have examined various deterrents for their potential to repel sea turtles from the vicinity of fishing operations; visual deterrents such as shark models/silhouettes and gillnet illumination have shown the most promise. However, given the difficulty of directly observing sea turtle behavior in the wild, laboratory trials are crucial for characterizing the sea turtle response to shark models. The present study examined the response of 42 captive-reared juvenile loggerhead sea turtles to a shark model in a controlled laboratory setting. Loggerheads exhibited defensive behavior toward the shark model, taking significantly more time to bite squid bait beneath the shark model than that for squid beneath a control object (sphere) and bare squid. Also, the turtles approached the shark model less often and exhibited more defensive carapace turns toward the shark model. Although the shark model in this study elicited avoidance behavior in loggerhead sea turtles, further research is needed to identify plausible applications, which would reduce sea turtle bycatch while maintaining target fish catch rates. It may be possible to develop a Children's Day Koinobori kite (a three-dimensional kite) in the shape of a shark that would unfurl and fly underwater and could possibly clip to main or float lines in commercial fisheries.

AB  - Commercial fisheries bycatch is a considerable threat to elasmobranch population recovery, and techniques to mitigate sub-lethal consequences can be improved with data on the energetic, physiological, and behavioral response of individuals to capture. This study sought to estimate the effects of simulated longline capture on the behavior, energy use, and physiological stress of juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Captive sharks equipped with acceleration biologgers were subjected to 1h of simulated longline capture. Swimming behaviors were identified from acceleration data using a machine-learning algorithm, energetic costs were estimated using accelerometer-calibrated relationships and respirometry, and physiological stress was quantified with point-of-care blood analyzers. During capture, sharks exhibited nine-fold increases in the frequency of burst swimming, 98% reductions in resting, and swam as often as unrestrained sharks. Aerobic metabolic rates during capture were 8% higher than for unrestrained sharks, and accounted for a 57.7% increase in activity costs when excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was included. Lastly, sharks exhibited significant increases in blood lactate and glucose, but no change in blood pH after 1h of capture. Therefore, these results provide preliminary insight into the behavioral and energetic responses of sharks to capture, and have implications for mitigating sub-lethal consequences of capture for sharks as commercial longline bycatch.

AB  - Psammobatis extenta es un miembro comn de la fauna de rayas de las costas de Sudamrica y su biologa ha sido poco estudiada. Se investigaron aspectos de la biologa de P. extenta a partir de datos obtenidos del descarte de arrastres comerciales de la flota pesquera de Puerto Quequn, Argentina, en febrero de 2000. La talla mxima alcanzada por las hembras fue 313 mm L T y 295 mm L T, por los machos. Las proporciones que presentaron menor variacin y relacin isomtrica fueron: distancia narina-boca, distancia interorbital, longitud ojo+espirculo, largo de disco y ancho de disco. La relacin L T-Peso total present diferencias significativas (P < 0,05) entre hembras y machos, las primeras alcanzando un mayor peso para el mismo L T. Los machos alcanzan la madurez a un L T de 260-266 mm, o al 89 % de su talla mxima. Las hembras alcanzan la madurez a un L T de 236-255 mm, o al 79 % de su talla mxima. Las hembras grvidas (13 % de las hembras maduras) presentaron un huevo por oviducto (oviparidad simple). Psammobatis extenta presenta dimorfismo sexual en la denticin y espinas alares: los machos maduros tienen cspides cnicas y agudas y poseen espinas alares en los mrgenes exteriores del disco, mientras que las hembras y los machos inmaduros tienen dientes redondeados y romos Psammobatis extenta is a common off-shore member of the South American skate fauna and its biology is poorly known. Aspects of the biology of P. extenta were investigated using data collected from bycatch of commercial trawls in February 2000 off the coast of Puerto Quequn, Argentina. The maximum size attained by females was 313 mm T L and 295 mm T L, by males. Measurements that presented less variation and isometric relation were: nare to mouth length, distance between orbits, orbit and spiracle length, disc length and disc width. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the T L -Total weight relation between females and males, the former attaining a greater weight for the same T L. Males reach maturity between 260 and 266 mm in length, about 89 % of their maximum size. Females reach maturity at a length of 236-255 mm, about 79 % of their maximum size. Gravid females (13 % of the mature females) presented one egg case per oviduct (single oviparity). There is sexual dimorphism in dentition and alar spines: mature males have pointed conical cusps and possess alar spines along the outer margins of the upper disc, whereas female and immature males have grinding blunt teeth

AB  - Shark nets were established along the KwaZulu-Natal coast in 1952 to protect bathers against shark encounters. Sea turtle bycatch data for the period 1981–2008 in these shark nets indicated that loggerheads Caretta caretta were caught most frequently at 40.9 y–1 or 1.11 km-net–1 y–1, followed by green turtles Chelonia mydas at 0.32 km-net–1 y–1 and leatherbacks Dermochelys coriacea at 0.14 km-net–1 y–1. Catch rate of loggerheads increased throughout the study period, and was positively correlated with the increase in the number of nesting females from the recovering population in Maputaland, South Africa (r = 0.52, p < 0.05, n = 28). This increase is ascribed to successful nest conservation. Leatherback bycatch remained stable, following their nesting trends, although they receive similar conservation efforts on nesting beaches as loggerheads. Bycatch of green turtles, although not a nesting species in South Africa, was stable over time. Mortality varied between species (from 53.2% to 70.6%) with loggerheads being the most hardy, followed by leatherbacks and green turtles. Few hawksbills Eretmochelys imbricata and olive ridleys Lepidochelys olivacea were caught in the shark nets. Fewer sea turtles are caught by shark nets than by longlines and because the nesting populations of loggerheads, green turtles and leatherbacks are either stable or increasing in the South-West Indian Ocean, shark net bycatch was considered negligible and sustainable.

AB  - Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark) is often caught as bycatch in demersal trawls in the Mediterranean. In order to reduce bycatches of shark we tested an excluder grid with 90mm bar spacing during experimental fishing in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Data collected made it possible to simultaneously evaluate catch losses of two commercial species: Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) and Phycis blennoides (greater forkbeard). The escape outlet ahead of the grid and the codend were both mounted with a cover in order to collect escaped fish ahead of the grid and through the codend meshes. We used a structural model to estimate the contribution of the individual selective processes consisting of the excluder grid and the size selective codend. The 90mm excluder grid did not prove to be efficient in excluding G. melastomus, while it excuded more of P. blennoides. Catches of N. norvegicus were also affected by the presence of the grid, but not as much as the catches of other two species. The results obtained for the experimental grid+codend setup were then compared with the estimated selectivity for the “codend alone” setup. Furthermore, by way of explorative simulation with other grid bar spacing, we concluded that reducing the grid bar spacing to 70mm would provide better compromise between the reduction of G. melastomus as bycatch and the catch rate of P. blennoides and N. norvegicus.

AB  - In 2001, paired-trawl comparisons were made during prawn trawl operations to assess the effect of turtle excluder devices and bycatch reduction devices on a range of species groups caught in tropical Australia. This study is one of the first to evaluate the commercial use of these devices in a tropical fishery. Nets with a combination of a turtle excluder device and bycatch reduction device reduced the catches of turtles by 99%, seasnakes by 5%, sharks by 17.7%, rays by 36.3%, large sponges by 85.3%, and small bycatch by 8%, however, these results were largely attributable to the influence of the turtle excluder devices. Nets with both devices also reduced the catch of commercially important prawns by 6%, but the proportion of soft and damaged prawns was reduced by 41%. The combination of these devices had no measurable impact on catches of any of the three byproduct species groups: Thenus spp. (Moreton Bay bugs), Teuthoidea spp. (squid) and Amusium pleuronectes (scallops). Turtles excluder devices reduced the numbers of larger sharks and rays (>1m) by 86% and 94%, respectively. They did not reduce the total number of sawfish caught, but did reduce the number of the most commonly caught species – the narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) – by 73.3%. Upward- and downward-excluding turtle excluder devices performed about equally for most species groups, although upward excluders were more effective for sharks and less effective for large sponges. The performance of BRDs was poor for most groups and could be improved by using them in more effective positions such as closer to the codend catch. The use of these devices is a major step towards ensuring the long-term conservation of many species, especially endangered sea turtles and vulnerable elasmobranchs. As fishers become more experienced in their use, we are optimistic that the fishery's impact on bycatch will reduce even further.

AB  - Our study assessed 16 different Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) for use in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), during three cruises in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The study was a response to pressure from conservation and community groups to make harvesting of the sea more selective and less damaging to the non-target communities. The approach was to incrementally improve the performance of BRDs after each stage: underwater observations in a flume tank and engineering trials at sea; rigorous and controlled scientific trials on the RV Southern Surveyor; testing under normal commercial fishing conditions. Bycatch Reduction Devices were improved throughout these procedures; only the best-performing devices were tested in the next stage.All four inclined grids (Super Shooter, Nordmøre grid, AusTED and NAFTED) were extremely effective at excluding large sharks, stingrays and sea turtles. They were also effective at excluding some of the unwanted small-fish catch, especially when used in combination with other BRDs, such as a fisheye or square-mesh window. Fish exclusion ranged between 0 and 39%. Exclusion of sea snakes was substantially increased by using BRDs, such as the AusTED or square-mesh windows.The ability of BRDs to maintain the catch of the target species was part of the assessment. The Super Shooter had the best prawn retention rate, losing only between 2 and 12% of prawns in scientific trials and gaining 3.4% during the commercial trials. The Super Shooter also performs well in areas where the other inclined grids tend to clog with sponges or other large objects. The NAFTED, which was used only during the commercial trials, lost only 3.3% of the prawn catch of a standard trawl. There is evidence that the fisheye may increase prawn catches. Other devices lost substantial numbers of prawns, but modifications could greatly improve their performance. Some of these devices could be used successfully in their present form. The performance of most BRDs were also strongly affected by the weather and fishing procedures, such as delay in haulback of the trawl.This study has shown that there are BRDs that can be of major benefit to prawn trawl fishers in the NPF, by excluding much of the unwanted bycatch while maintaining catches of commercially valuable prawns. The main benefits to the NPF fishery of using BRDs are:•fewer or no sea turtles caught or killed;•fewer small fish to be sorted from catches;•fewer large animals (stingrays, sharks and sea turtles) that can damage valuable prawns, resulting in a higher catch value; and•decreased fishing impacts on bycatch species, which helps to maintain ecological biodiversity and resilience of these demersal communities.Failure of the NPF and other Australian prawn trawl fisheries to voluntarily adopt BRDs may result in an involuntary adoption brought on by pressures from community, conservation and trade bodies.

AB  - An experiment was done to quantify species-specific variation in temporal hooking rates from demersal longlines targeting various carcharhinids off south eastern Australia, with a view to reducing the incidental catches of protected species, including the scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini, great hammerhead Sphyrna mokarran and grey nurse Carcharias taurus. The longline comprised a 9600 m mainline, separated into four sections (termed lines) each with 120 gangions (20 m apart) rigged with hook timers and 16/0 circle hooks baited with either sea mullet Mugil cephalus or eastern Australian salmon Arripis trutta. The mainline was deployed on each of 17 nights (between 19:30 and 23:30 h), with two lines retrieved after 7 and 14 h respectively. From a total of 8160 hooks, 246 timers were activated without hooking fish. Twenty-two species comprising 684 individuals were caught, including 52 S. lewini, 12 C. taurus, 11 S. mokarran and 1 loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta. Several environmental factors, including water temperature, moon phase and depth had mostly homogeneous, positive effects on catches. The only identified variables that might be used to considerably reduce the catches of Sphyrna were soak time and/or diurnal gear retrieval, with most individuals hooked during daylight. Simply mandating shorter deployments and within nocturnal retrieval might limit exploitation, especially among juveniles (<150cm total length). For the studied fishery to approach sustainability, future research is required to investigate other gear modifications for improving size and species selectivity, and/or operational procedures for mitigating discard and escape mortalities.

AB  - Globally, many gillnet fisheries have excessive discards which can comprise charismatic megafauna threatened with extinction, including numerous elasmobranchs. Very few discarded elasmobranch species have been assessed for their associated fates. Here we describe the immediate mortality of several threatened species discarded from gillnets deployed off eastern Australia to target key carcharhinids and white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias (within an objective of protecting bathers) and causal factors for abundant elasmobranchs. In total, 420 animals comprising at least 22 species were gillnetted with a total immediate mortality of 49 % and group-specific estimates of 100 % for dolphins (n = 8), 100 % for teleosts (n = 16), 86 % for sharks (n = 75), 45 % for turtles (n = 20) and 36 % for rays (n = 301). Among elasmobranchs, species that were obligate ram-ventilating (e.g. great hammerhead, Sphyrna mokarran and common blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus) had greater mortality (>95 %) than those species with spiracles, and likely capable of some stationary respiration (e.g. whitespotted guitar fish, Rhynchobatus australiae, whitespotted eagle ray, Aetobatus ocellatus, Australian cownose ray, Rhinoptera neglecta and to a lesser extent, pygmy devilray, Mobula kuhlii cf. eregoodootenkee) (16–74 % mortality). Mortalities among Australian cownose rays increased across longer soaks. The effect of soak time was further assessed to determine an optimal to maintain gillnet efficiency for target sharks, but minimise the absolute mortality of abundant rays and was estimated at up to three or four fishing nights (72–96 h). Other potential operational modifications, including using light and better retroactive deterrents to reduce turtle and dolphin bycatches and mortality, warrant investigation.

AB  - An industry-modified Nordmøre-grid was tested on its own and with a composite square-mesh panel as a secondary bycatch reduction device (BRD) at two different positions (aft and forward) in codends. Compared to the control codend (which had no BRDs), all three combinations (Nordmøre-grid only, Nordmøre-grid and aft composite square-mesh panel and Nordmøre-grid and forward composite square-mesh panel) reduced catches of prawns (mostly western king prawns, Penaeus latisulcatus). However, prawns were found to escape out of the Nordmøre-grid—not through the composite square-mesh panels. The Nordmøre-grid with the aft composite square-mesh panel significantly reduced the weight of bycatch (by 49%) and the numbers and weights of several commercially and non-commercially important bycatch species (by up to 75.7%). No other significant differences were detected. The results are discussed in terms of the likely factors influencing the performance of the various designs, including the behaviour of fish in codends, influences of hydrodynamics on their escape and the importance of the positioning of BRDs in codends.

AB  - The increase in population size of the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) off eastern Canada over the past 20 yr may be attributed to a decrease in shark stocks, their supposed predators. Reduction of the shark population is presumed to have resulted from a directed longline fishery and, of greater significance, from a change in the fishery for swordfish (Xiphias gladius) from selective harpooning to pelagic longlining, which has produced a large bycatch of sharks. The resulting enhanced survival of grey seals is reflected in greater infestation of commercially important fish species by the codworm (Phocanema decipiens).Key words: grey seals, harbour seals, sharks, swordfish, codworm, predation, fisheries

AB  - One key issue for standardizing catch per unit effort (CPUE) of bycatch species is how to model observations of zero catch per fishing operation. Typically, the fraction of zero catches is high, and catch counts may be overdispersed. In this study, we develop a model selection and multimodel inference approach to standardize CPUE in a case study of oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) bycatch in the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery. Alternative hypotheses for shark catch per longline set were characterized by the variance to mean ratio of the count distribution. Zero-inflated and non-inflated Poisson, negative binomial, and delta-gamma models were fit to fishery observer data using stepwise variable selection. Alternative hypotheses were compared using multimodel inference. Results from the best-fitting zero-inflated negative binomial model showed that standardized CPUE of oceanic whitetip sharks decreased by about 90% during 1995–2010 because of increased zero catch sets and decreased CPUE on sets with positive catch. Our model selection approach provides an objective way to address the question of how to treat zero catches when analyzing bycatch CPUE.

AB  - A 16‐year time series of research trawl catches, commercial landings, and effort data were used to evaluate two areas protected from mobile gear fishing off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and assess effects of the spring otter trawl fishery for longfin squid Loligo pealeii on local abundance of finfish frequently caught as bycatch. Catch rates were compared between a seasonal closure, a permanent closure, and adjacent waters open to mobile gear fishing. Winter flounder Pleuronecles americanus and scup Stenotomus chrysops were more abundant in the two protected areas. Black sea bass Centropristis striata and windowpane Scophthalmus aquosus were more abundant in the seasonal closure but not in the permanent closure. Abundance indices of summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and longfin squid were not significantly different between the seasonal closure and the exploited area but both species were less abundant in the permanent closure. Little skate Raja erinacea were more abundant in areas open to trawling. Significantly lower catch rates of the latter four species in the permanent closure indicated that habitat differences were important in determining local abundance. Decreased local density of finfish in open areas was not related to inshore spring squid trawling effort or landings. Regional trawl effort on Georges Bank and in southern New England did have significantly negative effects on local finfish density. Inferences of causal relationships between the inshore squid fishery and decreased local abundance of finfish were not supported. These results suggest that inshore abundance of these species is more related to total regional trawl effort.

AB  - Shortfin mako sharks are a high-value bycatch of pelagic longline fisheries off the eastern coast of Canada. Tagging studies indicate that they are highly migratory, seasonal residents of Canadian waters, representing the northern extension of a North Atlantic-wide population centred at more southerly latitudes. Annual catches in Canadian waters average 60–80mt per year, which represents but a small part of that estimated for the population as a whole. New ageing results indicate that the species grows more slowly than was reported previously, thus making the population less productive and more susceptible to overexploitation than has been reported. Two indices of population abundance did not provide a definitive view of mako shark population status. A standardized catch rate index from the commercial large pelagic fishery suggested stable abundance since 1988. However, the analysis did not have the statistical power to detect anything less than a severe decline. In contrast, the median size of mako sharks in the commercial catch has declined since 1998, suggesting a loss of larger sharks. These results are broadly consistent with a previous report of population decline, although it appears unlikely that current exploitation rates in Canada are having an appreciable impact on the population.

AB  - The use of small cetaceans as bait is a practice that has been reported worldwide, affecting the conservation status of vulnerable species. In Peru specifically, it has been documented since at least the late 1990s. Here we document the various contemporary uses of small cetaceans, including targeted capture for subsequent use as fishing bait. We designed a survey addressing fishery characteristics, bycatch and the use as bait of small cetaceans, and the history of these practice. We surveyed 147 fishers based in the four Peruvian ports of Paita, Salaverry, Pucusana, and Ilo and held in-depth interviews with 12 fishers from Salaverry and Pucusana. Results from our surveys show that the majority of fishers have had small cetacean bycatch while fishing and that bycaught individuals in gillnets are commonly found dead (Salaverry: 100% of fishers, Pucusana: 58%) whereas in longlines small cetaceans are found alive (Paita: 74%, Ilo: 53%). We found that the use of dolphins as bait is still common in both gillnet and longline shark fisheries along the coast of Peru and that it is more frequent in northern ports. Gillnet fishers reported using one to four dolphins as bait per trip (10–15 sets) from bycatch events and discarding the rest if they have excessive bycatch, while longline fishers reported using 10–20 dolphins per fishing trip from either direct take by harpooning or the exchange of carcasses from gillnet vessels. Bycatch and use as bait mainly affects four species, the dusky, bottlenose and common dolphins and the Burmeister’s porpoise. We identified three drivers of the use of dolphins as bait: effectiveness, availability and cost. These factors will have to be addressed in parallel if this practice is to be reduced. We recommend combining legislative and community-led strategies to reduce bait use and thus further the conservation of small cetacean populations in the southeastern Pacific Ocean.

AB  - The long-term effectiveness of acoustic pingers in reducing marine mammal bycatch was assessed for the swordfish and thresher shark drift gillnet fishery in California. Between 1990 and 2009, data on fishing gear, environmental variables, and bycatch were recorded for over 8,000 fishing sets by at-sea fishery observers, including over 4,000 sets outfitted with acoustic pingers between 1996 and 2009. Bycatch rates of cetaceans in sets with ≥30 pingers were nearly 50% lower compared to sets without pingers ( p = 1.2 × 10 −6 ), though this result is driven largely by common dolphin ( Delphinus delphis ) bycatch. Beaked whales have not been observed entangled in this fishery since 1995, the last full year of fishing without acoustic pingers. Pinger failure (≥1 nonfunctioning pingers in a net) was noted in 3.7% of observed sets. In sets where the number of failed pingers was recorded, approximately 18% of deployed pingers had failed. Cetacean bycatch rates were 10 times higher in sets where ≥1 pingers failed versus sets without pinger failure ( p = 0.002), though sample sizes for sets with pinger failure were small. No evidence of habituation to pingers by cetaceans was apparent over a 14-year period of use. Bycatch rates of California sea lions in sets with ≥30 pingers were nearly double that of sets without pingers, which prompted us to examine the potential “dinner bell” effects of pingers. Depredation of swordfish catch by California sea lions was not linked to pinger use—the best predictors of depredation were total swordfish catch, month fished, area fished, and nighttime use of deck lights on vessels.

AB  - Bycatch mitigation approaches aim to either reduce the incidence of unwanted catch or reduce bycatch mortalities. In pelagic longline fisheries incidence of unwanted catch can be reduced by limiting the availability of baited hooks (e.g., within bycatch species’ preferred depths and water temperatures), whereas bycatch mortalities can be decreased by gear modifications and changes to fishing practices, e.g., by limiting soak time. To evaluate the effects of temperature, depth, and soak time on catch of target and bycatch species, temperature recorders were set along the length of the longline to characterize the environment at which hooks were fishing. Although few instrumented sets were fished, observations at the within set scale – specifically, that swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catch did not increase with longer soak times – led us to reexamine assumptions made in fleet-wide catch models. Swordfish catch did not increase with soak time in generalized linear models based on fisheries observer data collected from swordfish-targeted sets fished by the Canadian pelagic longline fleet in 2008 and 2009 (n=42 and n=78, respectively). Minimum soak time, from end of setting to start of hauling, was used in swordfish catch models. Total soak time is inappropriate for catch models because it includes haulback time, which increases as a function of catch. If landed catch does not increase as a function of soak time, then limiting longline soak time to reduce bycatch mortalities would not cause decreased swordfish catch nor result in economic losses for fishers. While minimum soak time limits would likely decrease bycatch mortality rates in swordfish longline fisheries, impacts on other aspects of the fishing process would need to be considered, such as negative impacts on fisher safety.

AB  - Bycatch from pelagic longline fisheries has contributed to widespread population declines of turtles, sharks and other pelagic fishes. While large-scale estimates are needed to understand cumulative impacts on these highly migratory species, detailed information on targeting, setting, and discarding practices is needed to develop bycatch mitigation approaches. Data from qualitative fishers’ knowledge interviews with Canadian Atlantic pelagic longline captains was used to evaluate current bycatch estimation methods and to identify bycatch mitigation opportunities. Interviewed longline captains reported blue sharks (Prionace glauca) were common bycatch during swordfish-targeted sets, but were sometimes absent from tuna-targeted sets. Discrepancies between longline captains’ observations and bycatch assessment methods identified needed improvements to data collection methods. Longline captains reported innovative uses of turtle dehooking gear, which two-thirds of interviewed captains had used to release other bycatch species in addition to turtles. Longline captains reported techniques for discarding pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea), a common bycatch species in Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean pelagic longline fisheries. Therefore, such techniques could decrease fisheries impacts globally. While there can be major conservation benefits from fishers’ knowledge research, one-quarter of the active longline captains that we contacted declined interviews because they did not trust the larger research process. We urge conservation biologists to carefully design fishers’ knowledge research taking into account the often politicized context. Failure to do so may jeopardize future research and conservation efforts.

AB  - To evaluate how fishing practices affect bycatch survival and to identify opportunities to reduce bycatch mortality, we estimated the odds of hooking survival for common bycatch species in the Canadian longline fishery for swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and tunas (Thunnus spp.) fishing in the North Atlantic. Generalized linear models, with binomial response, were based on 859 sets observed between 2001 and 2004 and were tested using data from 2005 and 2006. Bycatch included targeted species in poor condition or below regulatory size limits. Odds of survival were two to five times higher for swordfish, yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea), porbeagle (Lamna nasus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) caught on circle hooks compared to J-hooks during the 2001–2004 period. Further, odds of severe hooking injuries decreased for three shark species caught on circle hooks. We found no conservation benefit for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from circle hook use. Increased circle hook use coincided with increased targeting and higher landings of tunas. Hooking survival rates and, therefore opportunities to reduce bycatch mortalities differed among the 10 species commonly discarded or released. Where the odds of survival to the time of release are high (e.g., loggerhead turtles, pelagic stingray, blue shark), methods to reduce post-release mortality can be considered. Where the odds of hooking survival are low (e.g., swordfish and longnose lancetfish, Alepisaurus ferox), methods to reduce encounter rates would have greater conservation impact.

AB  - BackgroundAccessing folk knowledge from small-scale fishers is an affordable and reliable approach to understand the dynamic and diversity of shark species worldwide, especially of those eventually caught. In this context, ethnotaxonomy (folk identification and classification) may represent an alternative to support sharks fisheries management, especially in data-poor places. This study aimed to investigate fishing and ethnotaxonomy of the main shark species caught by small-scale fisheries from the coastal waters of the Brazilian Northeast.MethodsSemi-structured and structured interviews were conducted with fishers targeting general aspects of fishing activities and specific topics regarding ethnotaxonomy, capture, and commercialization of sharks. For species identification, an ethnobiological systematic perspective was used to analyze the folk nomenclature and classification criteria. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to verify associations between species caught, fishing gear, and harvest period.ResultsFishers mentioned 73 binomial names, 21 main folk species, and eight synonymies. Some species belonging to the same scientific genus are often named and grouped by the same folk name, with no distinction between species by fishers. Sharks are most landed as bycatch and correspond to less than 5% of the total commercial fisheries in the communities, with socioeconomic value for subsistence consumption and local commercialization. Sharks were said to be mainly caught with hand line and surface long line during the rainy season, while gillnet captures were associated to the dry season. At least three of the species most mentioned by fishers are currently classified as vulnerable and endangered worldwide.ConclusionsEven though landed sharks account for a small proportion of the fishing catches, their biological and life history features place sharks among the most vulnerable organisms globally. Such an ethnobiological approach towards shark identification may contribute to generate basic information on species caught, their frequency in the landings, and how different species belonging to the same genus can be landed and sold together. This type of information can generate subsidies to the development of conservation and management plans for these fishing resources, where knowledge is scarce.

AB  - Scarce bycatches of Cookiecutter Shark (Isistius brasiliensis) is the reason why this species is easier studied through the marks they leave on their prey rather than by direct observation of the shark itself. However, scientific studies that have used ichnology to remedy this lack of knowledge have been probably based on mistaken assumptions transmitted among previous authors without due verification. Despite identifying the problem almost twenty years ago, the authors of this paper were unable to obtain a sufficient number of Cookiecutter Shark specimens until now in order to confirm their hypothesis. This work provides a set of biometrics of Cookiecutter Shark specimens among which worth highlighting is the measure of the lower jaw width (LJW), which was absent in the relevant literature. This parameter is crucial for correcting the linear regression between total length and mouth width on which earlier biogeographical works were based. The new linear regression obtained using LJW was later applied to the bites observed on Swordfish caught in the Gulf of Guinea in 1996. The results show a probability of 0.50 for Cookiecutter Shark attack on Swordfish in the study area (29.4% of Swordfish bitten), and a positive correlation between predator and prey sizes. The lengths of Cookiecutter Shark inferred from bite size on sampled Swordfish revealed a certain geographical disaggregation in the area, with older individuals, probably females, concentrating in waters near the mouth of the Congo River.

AB  - The Mediterranean starry ray (Raja asterias) populations within the Mediterranean Sea are susceptible to high rates of bycatch in the multispecies trawl fisheries. Understanding its population structure and identifying critical habitats are crucial for assessing species vulnerability and setting the groundwork for specific management measures to prevent population decline. To assess the population structure of R. asterias in the Mediterranean, the genetic variation in nine population samples at one mitochondrial marker and eight nuclear microsatellite loci was analysed. Moreover, 172 egg cases collected in the Strait of Sicily were identified at species level using integrated molecular and morphological approaches. Genetic analyses revealed that the Mediterranean starry ray comprises three distinct units inhabiting the western, the central‐western, and the central‐eastern areas of the Mediterranean. An admixture zone occurs in the Strait of Sicily and the Ionian Sea, where individuals of the central‐western and central‐eastern population units intermingle. The joint morphometric–genetic analyses of rajid egg cases confirmed the presence of more than one species in the admixture area, with a predominance of egg cases laid by R. asterias. DNA barcoding revealed that egg cases and embryos of R. asterias shared several haplotypes with adult individuals from the central‐western and central‐eastern Mediterranean Sea, revealing that females of both populations laid numerous eggs in this area. According to these findings, detailed taxonomic determination of egg cases, when combined with seasonal migration studies, could improve the capability to identify important spawning or nursery areas for the Mediterranean starry ray, particularly in those admixture zones relevant to maintaining genetic diversity. Finally, these new insights should be considered to update the Action Plan for the Conservation of Cartilaginous Fishes in the Mediterranean Sea with effective measures to reduce the impact of skate bycatch in trawling and safeguard egg cases in nursery areas.

AB  - Landings of batoids (rays and skates) have been rising in Argentina, reaching 14856mt in 1998. These species are poorly known, and their low fecundity, late maturity and slow growth rates make them vulnerable to stock collapse even when subjected to low levels of fishing pressure. Skates are commonly present as bycatch of commercial fisheries. Bycatch is of great concern both ecologically and in terms of fishery management, particularly in shrimp fisheries. The Patagonian red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) is the main crustacean fishery of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The skate bycatch in 313 tows of the double-beam trawl fishery was surveyed from September 2001 to September 2002. Seven species were recorded: Bathyraja albomaculata (n = 1), Dipturus flavirostris (n = 1008), Dipturus trachydermus (n = 138), Psammobatis normani (n = 1137), Psammobatis bergi (n = 9), Psammobatis rudis (n = 25), and Sympterygia bonapartei (n = 1081). Length–weight relationships, length-frequency by sex, and estimation of density and bycatch per unit of effort are given for each species. While shrimp catches for the double-beam trawl fleet were up to 55000mt, overall estimation of skate bycatch for the period under consideration was nearly 1000mt. Although rajids are released alive at sea, post-catch mortality is unknown.

AB  - Marine megafauna (elasmobranchs, marine mammals, turtles, and seabirds) are important ecologically and economically because many species often occupy upper trophic levels as adults and are essential for marine-based tourism in many areas of the world. This group of species is also heavily impacted by fishing because most have late sexual maturity, longevity, and low reproductive output, which affects their ability to recover from depletion. In Galapagos, marine megafauna species are protected from fishing throughout the marine reserve and are the main attraction for marine-based tourism, helping generate millions of dollars in revenue annually. Despite their importance in the archipelago, these species are being caught as bycatch in the multiple artisanal longlining projects that have been carried out since the implementation of the reserve in 1998. Longlining was originally proposed as a way of redirecting fishing effort from the severely depleted coastal-demersal species to pelagic fish such as yellowfin tuna and swordfish. Although all these projects have resulted in high bycatch of megafauna, longline fishing projects have continued without independent scientific studies to evaluate their impact, largely due to poor objective definition, data collection, and enforcement. To fill in this knowledge gap, we analyzed data of the fifth experimental longline fishing project undertaken in 2012–2013 to describe the fishery, identify variables affecting the composition and quantity of bycatch, and suggest mitigation strategies. This experimental project had twelve vessels, which deployed 42,007 hooks catching 4893 individuals of 33 species, mostly yellowfin tuna and swordfish. Of those, 16 species were protected megafauna, particularly blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) and oceanic manta (Mobula birostris). These species were regularly captured during the two seasons and in the three bioregions that occur in the archipelago, suggesting little potential to mitigate their catch. As an alternative, we identified 14 hotspots where yellowfin tuna and swordfish could be harvested in large numbers sustainably through more selective fishing techniques such as pole fishing, a method that is also more economical for artisanal fishers. In an archipelago where the main economic activity is marine wildlife tourism, the implementation of an extractive and unselective activity such as pelagic longing fishing should be avoided to ensure the sustainability of the Galapagos marine ecosystem and its booming tourism industry.

AB  - The scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, have a circumglobally distribution in tropical and warm-temperate waters. Generally, in Indian ocean this species is a bycatch of the tuna longline, however, in Tanjung Luar, this species is a target species. The life history from this species is still limited. The study aimed to assess the biology aspect and growth of the scalloped hammerhead in the period February 2013 to December 2016. The result showed that 2449 individuals were caught with size between 43-395 cm TL (average 198,03 cm) for females and males ranged between 47-340 cm TL (average 161.61 cmTL). The sex ratio that was dominated by female sharks was 2.69: 1. The clasper length and total length relationship were positive with a linear regression equation of CL = 0.0902*TL-4.4402 (R2=0.6837). It showed that the length of the claspers increases proportionally with the length of the body. Application of age at length data for produced von Bertalanffy growth model parameter estimates of female L∞ = 397 cm TL, K = 0.27 year−1, for male S. lewini was L∞ = 381 cm TL, K = 0.17/ year. The total mortality rate (Z) the scalloped hammerhead was 1.15/ years, natural mortality (M) is 037/ years and the fishing mortality (F) was 0.78/ years with exploitation rate (E) = 0.68

AB  - Recreational fishing is a vital component of the tourism economy in Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico, although several artisanal and industrial fisheries continue to operate in the region. The commercial long-liner fleet in particular is widely held to be responsible both for diminishing shark populations and declines in billfish through bycatch. Using available fisheries and ecosystem data, we develop an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model to represent current ecosystem and fishing dynamics in BCS and explore the ecological and economic effects of specific fisheries policy measures. Results suggest that currently mandated bycatch limits for the longlining fleet will have little effect on marlin abundance in the area. In an overfished ecosystem, decreasing fishing effort can result in higher overall catches through population rebuilding. While perhaps ecologically justified, increases in the abundance of sharks, a top predator, can have negative effects on other valued species in the ecosystem. The effects of these trophic dynamics must not be overlooked, as they can negate or even reverse desired outcomes from fisheries management.

AB  - The deep sea is the world's largest ecosystem, with high levels of biodiversity and many species that exhibit life-history characteristics that make them vulnerable to high levels of exploitation. Many fisheries in the deep sea have a track record of being unsustainable. In the northeast Atlantic, there has been a decline in the abundance of commercial fish species since deep-sea fishing commenced in the 1970s. Current management is by effort restrictions and total allowable catch (TAC), but there remain problems with compliance and high levels of bycatch of vulnerable species such as sharks. The European Union is currently considering new legislation to manage deep-sea fisheries, including the introduction of a depth limit to bottom trawling. However, there is little evidence to suggest an appropriate depth limit. Here we use survey data to show that biodiversity of the demersal fish community, the ratio of discarded to commercial biomass, and the ratio of Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) to commercial biomass significantly increases between 600 and 800 m depth while commercial value decreases. These results suggest that limiting bottom trawling to a maximum depth of 600 m could be an effective management strategy that would fit the needs of European legislations such as the Common Fisheries Policy (EC no. 1380/2013) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC).

AB  - The impact of shrimp trawl fisheries on slow-growing demersal sharks, skates and rays has been widely documented. Yet, a lack of catch records and biological information has hindered improvements in elasmobranch bycatch management, particularly in tropical regions. When information is scarce, data–poor methods can be valuable tools to guide the management and conservation of vulnerable marine taxa. Here we combined an Ecological Risk Assessment commonly used in data-deficient fisheries (Productivity Susceptibility Analysis or PSA) with a spatial analysis (Hotspot Analysis) to (i) identify which elasmobranch species are most vulnerable to the Costa Rican shrimp trawl fishery, and (ii) locate areas and seasons with high concentrations of vulnerable elasmobranchs. According to the results of our PSA, the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), prickly shark (Echinorhinus cookei), and long–tail stingray (Hypanus longus) were the most vulnerable species, while the least vulnerable species were small batoids of the Urotrygonidae family. We identified large information gaps, namely demographic parameter estimates and long–term bycatch trends. Spatial aggregations of vulnerable elasmobranchs occurred near highly productive estuaries and coastal habitats, especially at depths of 50–100m. Based on our findings, PSA and Hotspot analyses can be powerful tools to identify spatial areas where trawl fishing grounds overlap with the habitat of vulnerable bycatch species, and thus can be used to design spatial trawling closures that protect species at risk. We therefore conclude that our methodological approach may aid in the implementation of ecosystem–based fisheries management in data–poor situations.

AB  - The elasmobranch bycatch associated with the Costa Rican deepwater shrimp fishery is mainly comprised of four species: Raja velezi, Mustelus henlei, Zapteryx xyster and Torpedo peruana. In data-deficient fisheries such as this one, knowledge of the reproductive ecology of a species may serve as a valuable management tool to determine its vulnerability and apply precautionary measures to ensure its long-term conservation. This study examined the reproductive ecology of R. velezi, M. henlei, Z. xyster and T. peruana based on data collected during demersal trawling along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, Central America. A total of 290 trawls was analyzed at depths of 18–350m (March 2010–August 2012). While R. velezi, M. henlei and Z. xyster matured at similar sizes (range: 37–60cm TL), T. peruana matured at a larger size (70cm TL in females). The four elasmobranch species exhibited strong sex and size segregation patterns, which were mainly influenced by depth. Adults were more common at depths >50m, whereas neonates and gravid females were more abundant in shallow estuarine waters (<50m). Moreover, large aggregations of immature R. velezi and M. henlei occurred near coastal wetlands, bays and estuaries of the central Pacific region. These results suggest that shallow estuarine habitats may be important for early life stages of demersal elasmobranchs caught in the Costa Rican trawling fishery. However, our knowledge of critical habitats for elasmobranch along the entire Pacific of Costa Rica is still limited, and thus future studies are needed to identify and understand the role of these habitats in the early life-history of sharks, skates and rays.

AB  - Despite bycatch of elasmobranch (sharks and rays) being a major concern in most fisheries worldwide, there is a lack of knowledge on their spatio-temporal species distribution, biology (life stage and sex-ratios), as well as their at-haulback mortality rate. Observer data from the French and Spanish tropical purse-seine tuna fisheries operating in the eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans between 2005 and 2017 were analysed to investigate elasmobranch bycatch. Data included 24 elasmobranchs species and distribution patterns of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) by species and sex-ratio were found to vary with life stages, areas, seasons and fishing modes. In general, higher catches were found in FAD-associated sets (>40%) than free tuna school sets (<17%) although this can vary depending on the species. For the large majority of species, a high proportion of juveniles were caught (30.7–100%), apparent at-haulback mortality rates was high (24.3–63.9%) and finally sex ratios was unbalanced (13.3–66.7% of females). Areas and seasons identified from these different components should be of interest for the monitoring and management of elasmobranch bycatches.

AB  - The deep-sea lantern shark Etmopterus spinax occurs in the northeast Atlantic on or near the bottoms of the outer continental shelves and slopes, and is regularly captured as bycatch in deep-water commercial fisheries. Given the lack of knowledge on the impacts of fisheries on this species, a demographic analysis using age-based Leslie matrices was carried out. Given the uncertainties in the mortality estimates and in the available life history parameters, several different scenarios, some incorporating stochasticity in the life history parameters (using Monte Carlo simulation), were analyzed. If only natural mortality were considered, even after introducing uncertainties in all parameters, the estimated population growth rate (λ) suggested an increasing population. However, if fishing mortality from trawl fisheries is considered, the estimates of λ either indicated increasing or declining populations. In these latter cases, the uncertainties in the species reproductive cycle seemed to be particularly relevant, as a 2-year reproductive cycle indicated a stable population, while a longer (3-year cycle) indicated a declining population. The estimated matrix elasticities were in general higher for the survivorship parameters of the younger age classes and tended to decrease for the older ages. This highlights the susceptibility of this deep-sea squaloid to increasing fishing mortality, emphasizing that even though this is a small-sized species, it shows population dynamics patterns more typical of the larger-sized and in general more vulnerable species.

AB  - The smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena (Sphyrnidae) is regularly caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, but is one of the least studied of all pelagic sharks. Recently, ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) issued recommendations underlining the need for more studies on the life history parameters of this and other pelagic shark species. To this end, the age and growth of S. zygaena were studied in the Eastern Equatorial Atlantic Ocean, in an area where growth parameters were not yet available for this species. Data from 139 specimens, caught between June and September 2009, ranging in size from 136 to 233 cm fork length (FL), were analysed. Preliminary trials were carried out to assess the most efficient growth band enhancement technique. These indicated that sectioning the vertebrae into 500 μm sections followed by staining with crystal violet produced the best results. Growth models were fitted using the traditional von Bertalanffy growth equation and a modification of this equation using a known size at birth. Growth models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The von Bertalanffy growth equation seemed to be the most adequate model to describe growth in this species, with resulting growth parameters of Linf = 272 cm FL, k = 0.06 year for males and Linf = 285 cm FL, k = 0.07 year for females. In the first four years of life, S. zygaena grows 25 cm per year on average, but its growth slows down in later life. Future stock assessment models should incorporate these age and growth parameters for species management and conservation.

AB  - Pelagic longliners targeting swordfish and tunas in oceanic waters regularly capture sharks as bycatch, including currently protected species as the bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus. Fifteen bigeye threshers were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) in 2012-2014 in the tropical northeast Atlantic, with successful transmissions received from 12 tags for a total of 907 tracking days. Marked diel vertical movements were recorded on all specimens, with most of the daytime spent in deeper colder water (mean depth = 353 m, SD = 73; mean temperature = 10.7 °C, SD = 1.8) and nighttime spent in warmer water closer to the surface (mean depth = 72 m, SD = 54; mean temperature = 21.9 °C, SD = 3.7). The operating depth of the pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth Recorders (TDRs), and the overlap with habitat utilization was calculated. Overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is higher for juveniles. The results presented herein can be used as inputs for Ecological Risk Assessments for bigeye threshers captured in oceanic tuna fisheries, and serve as a basis for efficient management and conservation of this vulnerable shark species.

AB  - Modeling and understanding the catch rate dynamics of marine species is extremely important for fisheries management and conservation. For oceanic highly migratory species in particular, usually only fishery‐dependent data are available which have limitations in the assumption of independence and if often zero‐inflated and/or overdispersed. We tested different modeling approaches applied to the case study of blue shark in the South Atlantic, by using generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), and generalized estimating equations (GEEs), as well as different error distributions to deal with the presence of zeros in the data. We used fractional polynomials to deal with non‐linearity in some of the explanatory variables. Operational (set level) data collected by onboard fishery observers, covering 762 longline sets (1,014,527 hooks) over a 9‐year period (2008–2016), were used. One of the most important variables affecting catch rates is leader material, with increasing catches when wire leaders are used. Spatial and seasonal variables are also important, with higher catch rates expected toward temperate southern waters and eastern longitudes, particularly between July and September. Environmental variables, especially SST, also affect catches. There were no major differences in the parameters estimated with GLMs, GLMMs, or GEEs; however, the use of GLMMs or GEEs should be more appropriate due to fishery dependence in the data. Comparing those two approaches, GLMMs seem to perform better in terms of goodness‐of‐fit and model validation.

AB  - Pelagic sharks are an important bycatch in pelagic fisheries, especially for drifting longlines targeting swordfish. In the Cabo Verde Archipelago (tropical NE Atlantic), pelagic shark catches can reach a significant proportion of the total catches. Due to the increased concern on the status of pelagic shark species, this study was developed to enhance the current knowledge of those sharks in the Cabo Verde region in comparison to the adjacent areas, especially associated with European Union (EU) pelagic longline fishing activity. Stock status indicators for the two main species, blue shark (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), were developed, based on fisheries data from logbooks and onboard scientific observers, including analysis of size frequency distributions and standardized catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) indexes over time. The standardized CPUEs have been stable or increasing for both species in the past 10 years, indicating no signs of local depletion. In terms of sizes, the blue shark catch is composed mainly of adults, which can be a sign of a stable population. On the contrary, the catch of shortfin mako is composed mainly of juveniles, which in conjunction of a decrease of mean size might be a cause of concern, highlighting possible overfishing on the species in the region. Thirty satellite tags, 25 archival miniPATs and 5 SPOT GPS, were deployed in the Cabo Verde Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), showing that those species are highly mobile. The biomass and size distributions were modeled with spatial and seasonal models (GAMs) identifying locations where juveniles are predominantly concentrated and that should be prioritized for conservation. This work presents new information on the status of pelagic sharks in the Cabo Verde region in the context of those highly migratory species, and can now be used to promote more sustainable fisheries in the region.

AB  - We examined the effects of different hook style and bait type combinations on the catches of targeted, bycatch, and discarded fishes in equatorial atlantic waters. in total, 221 longline sets (>305,000 hooks) were deployed from portuguese pelagic longline vessels (sElEct-pal project) during the february–october fishing season. Three different hook styles and two bait types were tested: the traditional J-hook was compared to two circle hooks (one non-offset and one with 10° offset), and squid bait was compared to mackerel. catch per unit effort (cpuEs) were calculated and compared between the different hook style and bait type combinations, which indicated that the effects of hook style and bait on the cpuEs were species-specific. for example, swordfish cpuEs were higher with J-hooks baited with squid, while for targeted tunas and blue shark only the bait effect was significant, but with opposite effect (i.e., higher catches of tuna with squid bait and higher catches of blue shark with mackerel bait). for the discarded species, at-haulback mortality was also species-specific. proportions of alive vs dead specimens at time of fishing gear retrieval did not vary significantly by hook style or bait type combinations. The total retained catch was analyzed in value per unit effort (VpuE), and indicated losses in fishery revenue when mackerel was used instead of squid, but not when circle hooks were used instead of J-hooks.

AB  - Length–weight relationships were observed for six elasmobranch species from the Adriatic Sea. Between 2006 and 2019, data on weight and total length were collected for three shark species Alopias vulpinus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus; and data on weight and disk width were collected for three batoid species Aetomylaeus bovinus, Myliobatis aquila, Pteroplatytrygon violacea. Data collection comes from monthly observations as part of a monitoring program targeting specifically bycatch on pelagic pair trawlers involved in anchovy and sardine fishing. This fishery operates using pelagic trawls with a minimum mesh size opening of 20 mm. All elasmobranchs were measured to the nearest cm using a measuring board and weighed to the nearest gram using an electronic scale or a dynamometer for the largest specimens. A linear regression analysis performed on log‐transformed data was used to estimate intercept and slope, and to describe the length–weight relationship for each species.

AB  - This work aimed to characterize the nursery habitat use patterns of the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini (SPL), in coastal areas of Jalisco and Colima, through the birth pattern, space-time distribution and relationship with environmental conditions. Information was combined from three sources: monitoring bycatch from the artisanal fishery, fishery-independent samplings, and acoustic tracking and monitoring. From September 2013 to May 2017, 408 juvenile SPL (41.6-100.1 cm total length) were recorded. Births occurred between May and December (rainy-warmer season), within a radius of 2 km from river mouths in Marabasco, Navidad Bay, Rebalsito-Tecuan and Cuitzmala mainly in shallow (&lt;20 m), turbid and soft-bottom areas. Some tagged SPL moved from Marabasco and Rebalsito to Navidad Bay. The peak of catch and births occurred in June-August. Tagged SPL remained near the river mouth in Rebalsito for up to 27 days, showing a mean residency index of 0.29, a home range of 5.55 km<sup>2</sup> with a core area of 1.23 km<sup>2</sup> located within a 1.5 km radius from the river mouth. In December-January SPL left the river mouth areas and the catch was scarce until the following May-June, except in January 2016, when the catch was high due to El Niño 2015. SPL bycatch was significantly associated with temperature, precipitation and the Oceanic Niño Index.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch can severely affect the population status of species with low resilience such as sharks. Bycatch monitoring is an important issue for the development of conservation and management plans for these species. The main objectives of this study were to quantify and model the spatiotemporal trend of bycatch for porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) in the Argentinean surimi trawl fleet to identify hotspots in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Using onboard observer data, we have demonstrated that L. nasus was usually caught as bycatch by the surimi trawl fleet operating in the southern limits of the southwestern Atlantic (51°S–57°S), representing an important part of the reported catch for the Atlantic Ocean. Delta and Tweedie models indicated that bycatch had a relatively stable trend, was concentrated in a limited region of the study area, and was associated with spatiotemporal, operational, environmental, and prey availability variables. The model with the best predictive capability used for the spatial delineation of hotspots for L. nasus bycatch showed that the areas located south of 54°12′S and over the continental shelf-break were critical for the porbeagle conservation and management strategies in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - Understanding and reducing the incidence of accidental bycatch, particularly for vulnerable species such as sharks, is a major challenge for contemporary fisheries management. Here we establish integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) as two powerful tools for modelling patterns of bycatch through time and space. These novel, computationally fast approaches are applied to fit zero-inflated hierarchical spatiotemporal models to Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) bycatch data from the Baffin Bay Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) gillnet fishery. Results indicate that Greenland shark bycatch is clustered in space and time, varies significantly from year to year, and there are both tractable factors (number of gillnet panels, total Greenland halibut catch) and physical features (bathymetry) leading to the high incidence of Greenland shark bycatch. Bycatch risk could be reduced by limiting access to spatiotemporal hotspots or by establishing a maximum number of panels per haul. Our method explicitly models the spatiotemporal correlation structure inherent in bycatch data at a very reasonable computational cost, such that the forecasting of bycatch patterns and simulating conservation strategies becomes more accessible.

AB  - Spatial management for highly migratory species (HMS) is difficult due to many species’ mobile habits and the dynamic nature of oceanic habitats. Current static spatial management areas for fisheries in the United States have been in place for extended periods of time with limited data collection inside the areas, making any analysis of their efficacy challenging. Spatial modeling approaches can be specifically designed to integrate species data from outside of closed areas to project species distributions inside and outside closed areas relative to the fishery. We developed HMS-PRedictive Spatial Modeling (PRiSM), which uses fishery-dependent observer data of species’ presence–absence, oceanographic covariates, and gear covariates in a generalized additive model (GAM) framework to produce fishery interaction spatial models. Species fishery interaction distributions were generated monthly within the domain of two HMS longline fisheries and used to produce a series of performance metrics for HMS closed areas. PRiSM was tested on bycatch species, including shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), billfish (Istiophoridae), and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) in a pelagic longline fishery, and sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), dusky shark (C. obscurus), and scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) in a bottom longline fishery. Model validation procedures suggest PRiSM performed well for these species. The closed area performance metrics provided an objective and flexible framework to compare distributions between closed and open areas under recent environmental conditions. Fisheries managers can use the metrics generated by PRiSM to supplement other streams of information and guide spatial management decisions to support sustainable fisheries.

AB  - Manta and devil rays of the subfamily Mobulinae (mobulids) are rarely studied, large, pelagic elasmobranchs, with all eight of well‐evaluated species listed on the IUCN Red List as threatened or near threatened. Mobulids have life history characteristics (matrotrophic reproduction, extremely low fecundity, and delayed age of first reproduction) that make them exceptionally susceptible to overexploitation. Targeted and bycatch mortality from fisheries is a globally important and increasing threat, and targeted fisheries are incentivized by the high value of the global trade in mobulid gill plates. Fisheries bycatch of mobulids is substantial in tuna purse seine fisheries. Thirteen fisheries in 12 countries specifically targeting mobulids, and 30 fisheries in 23 countries with mobulid bycatch were identified. Aside from a few recently enacted national restrictions on capture, there is no comprehensive monitoring, assessment or control of mobulid fisheries or bycatch. Recent listing through the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) may benefit mobulids of the genus Manta (manta rays), but none of the mobulids in the genus Mobula (devil rays) are protected. The relative economic costs of catch mitigation are minimal, particularly compared with a broad range of other, more complicated, marine conservation issues. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Manta and devil rays (Mobulids) face several immediate threats, including incidental capture in industrial tropical tuna fisheries. As a result, efforts have emerged to avoid or mitigate Mobulid bycatch in these fisheries. However, many mitigation efforts fail to incorporate fisher expertise from the outset, potentially leading to interventions that are not viable. Here, we combine survey and focus group data to synthesize knowledge of Mobulid bycatch and mitigation ideas in Eastern Pacific Ocean purse seine fisheries. Primary obstacles for mitigating Mobulid bycatch, according to respondents, are: (1) an inability to sight Mobulids before capture, (2) the lack of specific equipment on board, and (3) the difficulty of releasing large individuals; we suggest that the latter two can be addressed by simple operational modifications. We also find that Mobulids are most likely to be sighted by fishers after capture, suggesting that this is an important time in the fishing operation for bycatch mitigation interventions that ensure Mobulids survive capture. To address this, we share creative ideas brought by fishers for avoidance of Mobulids. This study provides a model of how to incorporate stakeholder input in the design of bycatch technology in large-scale fisheries and could inform similar efforts around the world.

AB  - Silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) represent a major component of global shark catch, both directly and as bycatch, and populations are declining as a result. An improved understanding of their movement ecology is needed to support conservation efforts. We deployed satellite and acoustic tags (2013–2018) and analyzed historical fisheries records (1997–2009), to investigate the spatial ecology of silky sharks in the central Indian Ocean and a large Marine Protected Area (MPA; 640,000 km2) around the Chagos Archipelago. We observed high fidelity to the MPA, and a sustained diurnal association with a seamount complex, with individuals moving off at night and returning at sunrise. Yet, we also observed large-scale divergent movements in two satellite tagged individuals and documented the furthest recorded displacement distance for a satellite tagged silky shark to date, with one individual moving from the MPA to the Kenyan coast—a displacement distance of 3,549 km (track distance ∼4,782 km). Silky sharks undertook diel vertical migrations and oscillatory diving behavior, spending > 99% of their time in the top 100 m, and diving to depths of greater than 300 m, overlapping directly with typical deployments of purse seine and longline sets in the Indian Ocean. One individual was recorded to a depth of 1,112 m, the deepest recorded silky shark dive to date. Individuals spent 96% of their time at liberty within water temperatures between 24 and 30°C. Historic fisheries data revealed that silky sharks were a major component of the shark community around the archipelago, representing 13.69% of all sharks caught by longlines before the fishery closed in 2010. Over half (55.88%) of all individuals caught by longlines and purse seiners were juveniles. The large proportion of juveniles, coupled with the high site fidelity and residence observed in some individuals, suggests that the MPA could provide considerable conservation benefits for silky sharks, particularly during early life-history stages. However, their high mobility potential necessitates that large MPAs need to be considered in conjunction with fisheries regulations and conservation measures in adjacent EEZs and in areas beyond national jurisdiction.

AB  - Chondrichthyans (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras) are captured in many marine fisheries. Management and research efforts directed at chondrichthyan fishing are often neglected because of low product value, taxonomic uncertainty, low capture rates, and harvesting by multiple fisheries. In South Africa's diverse fishery sectors, which include artisanal as well as highly industrialised fisheries, 99 (49%) of 204 chondrichthyan species that occur in southern Africa are targeted regularly or taken as bycatch. Total reported dressed catch for 2010, 2011 and 2012 was estimated to be 3 375 t, 3 241 t and 2 527 t, respectively. Two‑thirds of the reported catch was bycatch. Regulations aimed at limiting chondrichthyan catches, coupled with species‑specific permit conditions, currently exist in the following fisheries: demersal shark longline, pelagic longline, recreational line, and beach‑seine and gillnet. Limited management measures are currently in place for chondrichthyans captured in other South African fisheries. Catch and effort dataseries suitable for stock assessments exist for fewer than 10 species. Stock assessments have been attempted for five shark species: soupfin Galeorhinus galeus, smoothhound Mustelus mustelus, white Carcharodon carcharias, spotted ragged‑tooth Carcharias taurus, and spotted gully Triakis megalopterus. Fishery‑independent surveys and fishery observer data, which can be used as a measure of relative abundance, exist for 67 species. Compared with most developing countries, South African shark fishing is relatively well controlled and managed. As elsewhere, incidental capture and bycatch remain challenges to the appropriate management of shark species. In 2013, South Africa's National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (NPOA‑Sharks) was published. Implementation of the NPOA‑Sharks should help to improve chondrichthyan management in the near future.

AB  - Today, elasmobranchs are one the most threatened vertebrate groups worldwide. In fact, at least 90% of elasmobranch species are listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, while more than 40% are data-deficient. Although these vertebrates are mainly affected by unsustainable fishery activities, bycatch is also one of the major threats to sharks and batoids worldwide, and represents a challenge for both sustainable fishery management and for biodiversity and conservational efforts. Thus, in this study, DNA barcode methodology was used to identify the bycatch composition of batoid species from small-scale industrial fisheries in the southwest Atlantic and artisanal fisheries from southeast Brazil. A total of 228 individuals belonging to four Chondrichthyes orders, seven families, and at least 17 distinct batoid species were sequenced; among these individuals, 131 belonged to species protected in Brazil, 101 to globally threatened species, and some to species with trade restrictions provided by Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). These results highlight the impacts on marine biodiversity of bycatch by small-scale industrial and unmanaged artisanal fisheries from the southwest Atlantic, and support the implementation of DNA-based methodologies for species-specific identification in data-poor fisheries as a powerful tool for improving the quality of fisheries' catch statistics and for keeping precise bycatch records.

AB  - Among the various shark species that are captured as bycatch in commercial fishing operations, the group of pelagic sharks is still one of the least studied and known. Within those, the crocodile shark, Pseudocarcharias kamoharai, a small-sized lamnid shark, is occasionally caught by longline vessels in certain regions of the tropical oceans worldwide. However, the population dynamics of this species, as well as the impact of fishing mortality on its stocks, are still unknown, with the crocodile shark currently one of the least studied of all pelagic sharks. Given this, the present study aimed to assess the population structure of P. kamoharai in several regions of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans using genetic molecular markers. The nucleotide composition of the mitochondrial DNA control region of 255 individuals was analyzed, and 31 haplotypes were found, with an estimated diversity Hd = 0.627, and a nucleotide diversity π = 0.00167. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a fixation index ΦST = -0.01118, representing an absence of population structure among the sampled regions of the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. These results show a high degree of gene flow between the studied areas, with a single genetic stock and reduced population variability. In panmictic populations, conservation efforts can be concentrated in more restricted areas, being these representative of the total biodiversity of the species. When necessary, this strategy could be applied to the genetic maintenance of P. kamoharai.

AB  - Sustainability of living resource exploitation relies on an ecosystem management approach. Within tropical tuna purse seine fisheries using fish aggregating devices (FADs), such an approach incorporates the reduction of bycatch, in particular vulnerable species such as elasmobranchs. The levels of total bycatch (in mass) from fishing operations using FADs is known to be five times higher than when tuna are caught in free-swimming schools. We intend to find practical solutions to reduce bycatch in FAD sets through the investigation of the relationships between the ratio of bycatch to target catch across different set size classes in all oceans. Ratios were always highest when catches were small, with the smallest class of catches responsible for the highest total portion of bycatch (23%–43%) while only contributing negligibly to the total target catch (3%–10%). Reducing the number of fishing sets (a part of the total effort) while maintaining the same total yield could contribute to a substantial reduction in the impacts of human activities.

AB  - We used data collected by an observer program to assess the impact of the Costa Rican longline fishery on numbers, capture locations, seasonality and body sizes of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), pelagic thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus), olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) and other bycatch species in the Central American Pacific. The longline fishery caught a large number of mahi-mahi (Coryphaena sp.) and silky sharks, but also caught a large number of olive ridley turtles and pelagic stingrays (Pteroplatytrygon violacea). We estimated that longline fisheries caught 699,600 olive ridleys, including 92,300 adult females, from 1999 to 2010. These captures were associated with a decline of nesting populations at nearby arribada beaches. There were statistically significant size decreases from 1999 to 2010 in mature olive ridley turtles and from 2003 to 2010 in silky sharks. Average fork length of silky sharks in 2010 was 97.3cm, which was far below observed fork length at maturity, 144cm. Pelagic thresher sharks were small and fluctuated in size over the study period. Capture of large numbers of juvenile blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) indicated a nursery area near the Osa Peninsula. Geospatial analysis indicated shifts in mahi-mahi abundance on a temporal scale but fishing efforts did not shift with the shift in mahi-mahi abundance. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), Indo-Pacific blue marlin (Makaira mazara) and Indo-Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) catches varied seasonally and were most abundant out to sea and south of Panama. Marine protected areas and/or time area closures are needed to reduce the impact of the Costa Rican longline fishery on sea turtles and sharks.

AB  - Incidental fisheries capture has been identified as having a major effect on shark populations throughout the world. However, factors that contribute to the mortality of shark bycatch during fisheries capture are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the effects of capture duration, sea surface temperature, and shark total length (snout to the tip of the upper caudal lobe) on the physiology and condition of longline-caught bronze whalers, Carcharhinus brachyurus. Plasma lactate and potassium concentration had a positive linear relationship with capture duration, indicating that this species experiences increasing physiological challenges while on fishing gear. Additionally, we used stereotype logistic regression models to determine variables that could predict the capture condition of sharks (categorized as “healthy,” “sluggish,” or “moribund or dead”). In these models, elevated plasma lactate concentration, plasma potassium concentration, and capture duration increased the likelihood of C. brachyurus being captured in a “sluggish” condition or in a “moribund or dead” condition. After plasma lactate concentration exceeded 27.4 mmol/L, plasma potassium concentration exceeded 8.3 mmol/L, or capture durations exceeded 293 min, the majority of captured sharks (>50%) were predicted to be “moribund or dead.” We recommend that a reduction in the amount of time longlines are left fishing (soak time) will reduce immediate and post-release mortality in C. brachyurus bycatch and that our methods could be applied to identify causes of fisheries-induced mortality in future studies. The identification of operational, environmental, and biological variables contributing to poor condition will be necessary to implement conservation strategies that reduce mortality during capture.

AB  - In Ecuador, one of the main hazards for threatened marine species, such as sea turtles, is small-scale fisheries bycatch. At a global scale, currently, bycatch reduction technologies (BRTs) are being tested in many coastal nations to mitigate this issue. Despite some advances in Ecuadorian efforts for wildlife protection, BRTs to reduce bycatch have yet to be assessed. The purpose of this study was to test the BRT of net illumination using violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a mitigation measure to reduce sea turtle interactions in the small-scale driftnet fishery operating from the ports of Santa Rosa, Puerto Lopez and Jaramijo. A total of 146 pairs of experimental sets (control and illuminated panes) were deployed in all ports. A generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLMM) was employed to analyze the bycatch per unit of effort (BPUE) for sea turtles, and the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for target species; for both control and illuminated panes. Thirty-two sea turtles from three species were observed captured: olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (n=18), green Chelonia mydas (n=13) and leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea (n=1). Turtle species-specific modeling showed bycatch of green turtles declined by 93% in illuminated nets compared with control, non-illuminated nets, whereas no significant difference between control and illuminated nets was observed for olive ridley turtles. The catch per unit effort of the target pelagic fish species including skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, mahi-mahi, thresher shark and smooth hammerhead shark was not affected by net illumination. Our results represent the first evaluation of the effects of net illumination using LEDs on reducing marine turtle bycatch in Ecuadorian small-scale driftnet fisheries. Despite its relatively small sample size, these results could be used by fisheries managers to support the implementation or further testing of this BRT in gillnet fisheries along the Ecuadorian coast.

AB  - Elasmobranchs inhabiting depths beyond 200 m are extremely susceptible to overexploitation but are extracted by fisheries around the world either as target species or as bycatch. There is little information available to formulate management strategies to reduce elasmobranch-fishery interactions in the deep sea. In European Union waters, prohibiting the catches of deep-sea elasmobranchs has provided the necessary impetus to study by-catch avoidance of these threatened species. We used over 20 years of fisheries-independent and fisheries-dependent data to model the spatial distribution of 15 species of deep-sea elasmobranchs (12 sharks and 3 rays) captured frequently in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Azores Archipelago (Mid-Atlantic Ridge) to explore spatial management to reduce unwanted catches of these species. We applied Generalised Additive Models to predict the probability of presence of 15 species, as well as the abundance of 6 of those species, within the Azores EEZ and neighbouring seamounts (up to 2000 m depth), using environmental and operational variables as predictors. Our results identified that depth is most influential in determining the distribution of these sharks and rays, in addition to seafloor topography. Distinctive bathymetric features such as seamounts and ridges were highlighted as areas where the probability of presence of the greatest number of species overlapped. Although not related to habitat, gear type influenced the capture probability of certain species, with the artisanal handline, gorazeira, having lower captures than bottom longline. Our results support using depth-based, area-based, and gear-based tactics to design management measures to reduce elasmobranch bycatch, for more sustainable deep-sea fisheries.

AB  - The impact of industrial fisheries on marine biodiversity is conspicuous in large pelagic vertebrate's fisheries bycatch. In seabirds, this led to the decline of many populations since the 1980s following the rise of global fishing effort. Bycatch mitigation measures were implemented since the 2000s, but their effects on the concerned seabird populations remain poorly quantified and understood. We studied the effects of bycatch mitigation measures on the demography of the white‐chinned petrel, one of the most bycatch impacted seabirds whose populations suffered dramatic declines before the implementation of mitigation measures. To do so we (a) built multi‐event capture–recapture models to estimate the demographic parameters of a population from Possession Island (southern Indian Ocean) over 30 years, (b) assessed the effect of climate and fishery covariates on demographic parameters, (c) built a population matrix model to estimate stochastic growth rate according to the management in fisheries bycatch and (d) estimated changes in breeding population density using distance sampling data. The population declined from the 1980s to the mid‐2000s, while trawl and longline fisheries occurred with no bycatch mitigation measures. The negative effects of fishery bycatch through additive mortality and of rat predation on breeding success were likely the main drivers of this decline. Both modelled population growth rate and observed breeding densities showed an increase since the mid‐2000s. We explained this trend by the improvement in survival probability following implementation of fishery bycatch mitigation measures and in breeding success probability with the local control of the rat population and changes in sea ice conditions on foraging grounds. Synthesis and applications. We provide a holistic approach to assess the effects of management measures by analysing datasets from sampling methods commonly employed in seabird studies. Our conclusions should encourage the eradication of invasive predatory species in seabird breeding areas and the strengthening of bycatch mitigation measures for the vulnerable seabird species, especially in international waters, but also the development of such measures considering the other marine large pelagic species threatened by fisheries bycatch (sharks, rays, turtles and marine mammals) since it could be crucial to avoid populations' extinction.

AB  - Large estuaries are often highly productive and biodiverse areas of ecological and economical significance. Assessing the movement behavior and space use patterns of mobile organisms in these highly dynamic areas is critical for understanding ecological dynamics within systems. Fine-scale movement data, which is useful for successful species management and conservation, is lacking for ecologically relevant species in many estuarine systems, due to the demands for fine-scale data collection methods and increased use of more passive tracking methods. Six bonnetheads (Sphyrna tiburo) and four bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) were tracked within the Apalachicola Bay system using active acoustic telemetry for periods up to 52 h to compare space use patterns and rates of movement across tidal and diel cycles. Tidal and diel periods had significant effects on the rate of movement (ROM) of both species, with increased ROM during crepuscular periods. Movement behavior was likely driven by a combination of optimal foraging strategies, predator avoidance, and abiotic factors. Unique movement behaviors exhibited by mature bonnetheads provide clarity for their high bycatch rates in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl and should be considered during the formulation of conservation and management measures for the species. By comparing simultaneous active and passive acoustic telemetry data from bonnetheads, we determined that ROM has a negative effect on passive acoustic detection success. More investigation into the effects of environmental conditions and movement on detection efficiency is needed as passive telemetry becomes more widely used to study aquatic animal movement.

AB  - Increasing fishing effort, including bycatch and discard practices, are impacting marine biodiversity, particularly among slow-to-reproduce taxa such as elasmobranchs, and specifically sharks. While some fisheries involving sharks are sustainably managed, collateral mortalities continue, contributing towards > 35% of species being threatened with extinction. To effectively manage shark stocks, life-history information, including resource use and feeding ecologies is pivotal, especially among those species with wide-ranging distributions. Two cosmopolitan sharks bycaught off eastern Australia are the common blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus; globally classified as Near Threatened) and great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran; Critically Endangered). We opportunistically sampled the digestive tracts of these two species (and also any whole prey; termed the ‘Russian-doll’ approach), caught in bather-protection gillnets off northern New South Wales, to investigate the capacity for DNA metabarcoding to simultaneously determine predator and prey regional feeding ecologies. While sample sizes were small, S. mokkaran fed predominantly on stingrays and skates (Myliobatiformes and Rajiformes), but also teleosts, while C. limbatus mostly consumed teleosts. Metabarcoding assays showed extensive intermixing of taxa from the digestive tracts of predators and their whole prey, likely via the predator’s stomach chyme, negating the opportunity to distinguish between primary and secondary predation. This Russian-doll effect requires further investigation in DNA metabarcoding studies focussing on dietary preferences and implies that any outcomes will need to be interpreted concomitant with traditional visual approaches.

Hierarchical analysis of a remote, Arctic, artisanal longline fishery. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 41–51. This is the first paper to explore trends in catch per unit effort (cpue) through time of a Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides stock targeted by an artisanal, winter fishery in Cumberland Sound on southern Baffin Island, Canada. We modelled cpue data from 1987 to 2003, looking at two questions: what factors have driven cpue trends, and is cpue an accurate index of a stock's abundance? In the context of limited data availability, we used generalized linear models (GLMs) and hierarchical models to assess important predictors of cpue. Hierarchical models with multiple fixed environmental effects contained fishing location or individual fisher as random effects. A month effect showed greatest catch rates during February and March; the monthly North Atlantic Oscillation index was positively associated with catch rates; and a change from decreasing to increasing cpue after 1996 was linked to reduced fishery participation following a large storm. The best Akaike's information criterion-ranked GLM identified a negative relationship of cpue with shark bycatch. Although data limitations precluded conventional stock assessment, our models implicated the environment and fisher behaviour as drivers of cpue trends. Additionally, using multiple hierarchical models to predict cpue provided a more informative analysis for understanding trends in cpue than a GLM alone.

AB  - Indonesian waters have a high diversity of sharks and rays, with at least 118 species belonging to 25 families found throughout the vast archipelago. Indonesia also has the highest shark landings globally and nearly all high‑value shark species are overexploited and could be considered threatened. This situation is of international concern, especially among conservationists and elasmobranch scientists. Most of the shark catch in Indonesian waters is taken as bycatch of fisheries deploying various types of gear, including longlines, driftnets, handlines and purse‑seines. However, sharks are also targeted in several regions of eastern and southern Indonesia, where they are often the main source of livelihood for many artisanal fishers. Shark fishing, whether targeted or bycatch, occurs throughout most of Indonesia's waters, and the large size of the EEZ, which encompasses nearly 6 million km2, is a primary constraint regarding the effective management of shark fisheries. In 2009, 11 fisheries management zones were established through the gazetting of a regulation on regional fisheries, facilitating management by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. Here, we discuss how the implementation of a number of regulations gazetted by the Indonesian government to ensure sustainable utilisation of fisheries resources should take into account shark resources. We also examine recent elasmobranch conservation efforts by the government, including the recent designation of whale sharks Rhincodon typus and manta rays Manta alfredi and M. birostris as fully protected species, and a prohibition on exports of products of hammerhead Sphyrna spp. and oceanic whitetip sharks Carcharhinus longimanus.

AB  - The longhorned pygmy devil ray Mobula eregoodoo (Cantor, 1849), formerly known as Mobula eregoodootenkee (Bleeker, 1859), is a small mobulid with a disc reaching a maximum width of 1.3 m, widely ranging in tropical and subtropical latitudes across the Indian Ocean, the Indo‐Pacific region, and the western Pacific Ocean. A recently emerged opportunity to examine several (n = 47) M. eregoodoo specimens bycaught in bather protection gillnets off New South Wales, Australia, together with new information assembled from other areas of its range, now allows for a redescription of the species, which was incompletely described in the past because of a paucity of specimens. Based on the morphometric, morphological, ecological, and behavioural elements presented here, corroborated by recent genetic investigations, we argue that M. eregoodoo (Cantor, 1849) is a valid species, distinct from shorthorned pygmy devil ray Mobula kuhlii (Müller & Henle, 1841). These findings are contrary to a recent revision of Mobula, where it was assessed as a synonym of M. kuhlii. The accuracy of taxonomic assessments underpins the effectiveness of species conservation, particularly when direct exploitation or bycatch in various fisheries needs to be managed for sustainability. Failing to recognize that two similar‐looking species are distinct, such as M. eregoodoo and M. kuhlii, creates uncertainties that could result in mismanagement and underestimating local and global threats of extinction.

AB  - Sharks play important ecological roles in marine ecosystems. However, due to their life-history traits and low resilience, their vulnerability increases with overexploitation. The Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) purse-seine fishery catches several pelagic sharks as bycatch. Therefore, describing the environmental preferences of bycaught sharks is crucial to improve fisheries management. This study aims to describe the environmental preferences and spatiotemporal distribution of most bycaught shark species within the EPO through Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Results show that the silky shark (C. falciformis) is bycaught in oceanic waters on floating objects, and close to the coast in unassociated and dolphin sets. This species inhabits warm waters with low or high productivity. Oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus) is bycaught in warm and oceanic waters with low productivity. Meanwhile, scalloped and smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini & S. zygaena) are bycaught in temperate and productive waters offshore of Peru. The obtained results allowed us to identify hotspots where fisheries management can be implemented, improved, or modified (e.g., temporal closures) for reducing shark bycatch.

AB  - Shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) are a relevant bycatch in the Spanish surface longline fisheries that operate in the Atlantic Ocean. Concern has been raised after the 2017 and 2019 shortfin mako evaluations for the Northern Atlantic stock. It stated the population being overfished and suffering from overfishing. Also blue shark is subject to high extraction rates in the Atlantic Ocean. Few data and uncertainty in assessment results suggest that further management strategies could be taken into account for both species. This study evaluated different fisheries management strategies for shortfin mako and blue shark in the Atlantic Ocean from the stakeholders' perspective. Personal interviews were conducted with Spanish fishermen and surveys were sent to scientists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Local Ecological Knowledge was considered to be useful as fishermen possess unique expertise based on their continued interaction with the species and environment. Interviews allowed understanding the fishermen's perception on variations of stock abundance, distribution patterns, size of capture and seasonal fluctuations for both species. SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)-analysis was used to study the different management measures. Main management strategies proposed by all stakeholders to reduce the bycatch of both species were spatial-temporal closure, minimum size and quotas. The Sole Bank was suggested as a temporarily closed area to protect blue shark juveniles during the summer months. The participation of stakeholders enriched the knowledge available and provided a broader data set now available for decision makers in the corresponding regional fisheries management organization (RFMOs).

AB  - Elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and skates) are caught throughout fisheries globally, leading to over one-third of species being threatened with extinction<sup>1</sup>. Oceanic shark populations have undergone an average 71% decline over the last half century, owing to an 18-fold increase in relative fishing pressure<sup>2</sup>. Incidental capture or 'bycatch' is a primary driver of population declines, and poses an important challenge for species conservation<sup>3</sup>. This threat necessitates mitigation strategies that exist for sharks but are often focussed on haul-back and post-capture effects for longline fishing. We trialled a novel shark bycatch mitigation device ("SharkGuard") in a commercial longline fishery targeting bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), where bycatch consists largely of blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and pelagic stingrays (Pteroplatytrygon violacea).

AB  - Circle hooks have been promoted as an alternative to traditional J-hooks in pelagic longline fisheries to minimize bycatch mortality and injury to sea turtles and other marine wildlife. We evaluated the effect of hook type (circle hook vs J-hook) on the catch and length composition of target and non-target species in the Uruguayan pelagic longline fishery, for both American- and Spanish-style longlines. The sample unit used for comparing catches was two consecutive sections of the longline, each with a different hook type. For the American-style longline 39,822 hooks were deployed in 108 paired sections, and for the Spanish-style 45,142 hooks were deployed in 238 paired sections. The catch of albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga (Bonnaterre, 1788), was higher with circle hooks with both gears. The catch of shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus (Rafinesque, 1810), also increased with the use of circle hooks, but only with the American-style longline. A decrease was observed in the catch of pelagic stingray, Pteroplatytrygon violacea (Bonaparte, 1832), with both gears, though it was significant only with the Spanish-style longline. The performance of circle hooks for other target species, such as swordfish, Xiphias gladius (Linnaeus, 1758), and sharks, and for bycatch species including sea turtles and seabirds remains unclear and requires further research.

AB  - Sharks of the genus Carcharhinus are captured as bycatch in longline fisheries and through different fishing gears. Due to the common practice of head and fin removal of sharks, the lack of morphometric data and weight on landings by species hinders the implementation of management measures, since they are needed to perform a stock assessment. Here, we present the length–length (LLR) and length–weight (LWR) relationships of the silky shark (n=145) and night shark (n=90) caught by the commercial pelagic longline fisheries in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (22°S–33°S; 25°W–50°W) between April 2009 and August 2010. All length–length and length–weight relationships were extremely significant with the coefficient of determination (r2) ranging around 0.99. There were no significant differences in the regression parameters of the length–length and length–weight relationships between males and females to both species. These results represent the first reference on the LLRs and LWRs to silky shark and night shark, using the carcass length (CL—distance between the origin of the pectoral fin to the origin of the caudal fin, in cm) as the basis for all conversion factors.

AB  - We currently face a unique phase in the global biodiversity crisis because of massive introductions of non-native species into greatly altered ecosystems. These introductions frequently occur as a consequence of human constructions and structures such as dams that allow species to overcome historic established biogeographic barriers. There is a pressing need for study the socio-economic influence of invasive populations. Here we assessed the effects of one of the largest invasion events of elasmobranchs in the world. We investigated socio-economic impacts caused by invasive populations of freshwater stingrays in the upper Paraná River ecoregion (Brazil) using questionnaires to survey 125 artisanal fishers. The two study species are not tradable, may damage gear and cause accidents directly linked with their presence in the ecosystem, so are associated with economic losses for fishers. Thus, the local population perceives stingrays as a bycatch with strong negative socio-economic outcomes. Our results indicate that large-scale invasions triggered by enterprises (e.g. dams) can misguide conservation policies and management and cause multilevel damages to human well-being, especially if local information and local perception are not taken into account. The assessment of social perception demonstrated that invasive stingrays are not welcome or beneficial for the traditional resident human population.

AB  - The present study sought to study the reproductive biology of the oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus, in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean. A total of 234 specimens were collected as bycatch during pelagic longline fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish, between December 2003 and December 2010. The fishing area was located between latitudes 10N and 35S and longitudes 3E and 40W. Of the 234 individuals sampled, 118 were females (with sizes ranging from 81 to 227 cm TL, total length) and 116 males (ranging from 80 to 242 cm TL). The reproductive stages of the females were classed as immature, mature, preovulatory and pregnant, while males were divided into immature, maturing and mature. The size at maturity for females was estimated at 170.0 cm TL, while that for males was between 170.0 and 190.0 cm TL. Ovarian fecundity ranged from 1 to 10 follicles and uterine fecundity from 1 to 10 embryos. The reproductive cycle of this species is most likely biennial, with parturition occurring once every two years.

AB  - The incidental capture and mortality of endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) marine species remains a global problem. Among the most problematic fishing methods is penaeid trawling, which is responsible for one quarter of the world's discarded bycatch and remains a key threatening process to ETP species (turtles and some elasmobranchs). So-called ‘turtle excluder devices’ (TEDs) legislated among USA penaeid trawlers and subsequently fleets in other countries during the 1990s alleviated some concerns over impacts to ETP species, but adoption has not been global. One country characterised by resistance to TEDs is Brazil—despite federal legislation mandating usage for almost 25 years. The reasons for this deficit, reiterated here via interviews with 64 southern penaeid-trawler captains, are threefold. First, are perceived issues with mandated designs and minimal third-party expertise, leading to a sustained misconception that TEDs simply do not work in Brazilian penaeid trawls. Second, is the perpetuated belief of minimum negative impacts to ETP species; exacerbated by few quantitative data. Third, is jurisdictional failure to promote the concept that slight economic loss associated with not catching ETP species (elasmobranchs) is necessary for broader ecological sustainability. We propose TED use among Brazilian penaeid-trawl fisheries might be promoted via a co-management strategy facilitated by sustained education and technical expertise from research providers encouraging fishers to develop fishery-specific solutions. If industries can be encouraged to accept the concept of TEDs, they might then be expected to refine and develop ownership of the most appropriate configurations.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment (ERA), including Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis (PSA), is becoming increasingly used to assess the relative vulnerability of data-limited non-target species to the impacts by fishing. PSA was developed for the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) tuna purse-seine fishery to assess the vulnerability of incidentally-caught species for three set types, “dolphin sets”, “unassociated sets” and “floating-object sets”, during 2005–2013. Because of operational differences between these set types, susceptibility values were combined for each species across the three set types to produce an overall fleet-wide susceptibility estimate. Vulnerability was highest for elasmobranchs, namely the giant manta ray, bigeye and pelagic thresher sharks, smooth and scalloped hammerhead sharks, and silky shark. Billfishes, dolphins, other rays, ocean sunfish, and yellowfin and bigeye tunas were classified as moderately vulnerable while the remaining species, all teleosts, had the lowest vulnerability scores. This purse-seine fleet-wide PSA identified potentially vulnerable species that can be compared with PSAs for other fisheries operating in the EPO, once detailed catch information becomes available for those fisheries. Such information can assist managers with prioritising fishery- and species-specific research programs and/or mitigation measures.

AB  - Diet studies are an essential component of ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management. In the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), the silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) is the most common species of shark in the bycatch of the tuna purse-seine fishery. A rare, comprehensive dataset of stomach contents of 786 silky sharks sampled in mostly tropical regions of the EPO (25°N–15°S; 79°W–162°W) during 1992–1994 and 2003–2005 was analyzed via classification tree and quantile regression methodologies to gain insight into its ecosystem role. Results suggest that the silky shark is an opportunistic predator that forages on a variety of prey. Broad-scale spatial and shark size covariates explained the feeding habits of silky sharks captured in sets on floating objects, primarily drifting fish-aggregating devices (FADs). A strong spatial shift in diet was identified by the tree analysis, with different foraging patterns in the eastern (inshore) and western (offshore) regions. Greater proportions of FAD-associated prey than non-FAD-associated prey were observed in the diet throughout the EPO, with the greatest proportion in the offshore region. Thus, silky sharks appear to take advantage of the associative behavior of prey fishes to increase their probability of encountering and capturing prey. Evaluation of prey–predator size relationships showed that maximum prey size increased with increasing silky shark size, but minimum prey size remained relatively constant across the range of shark sizes. Results such as these from spatially oriented analyses of predator feeding habits are essential for populating ecosystem models with space-based food webs, which otherwise suffer from generic representations of food webs.

AB  - Squaliforme sharks are a common but relatively vulnerable bycatch in many deep water fisheries. Eleven species of squaliforme shark are commonly caught at depths of 200-1200 m on Chatham Rise, New Zealand, and their diversity suggests they might occupy different niches. The diets of 133 Deania calcea and 295 Squalus acanthias were determined from examination of stomach contents. The diet of D. calcea was characterised by mesopelagic fishes, and S. acanthias by benthic to pelagic fishes, but was more adaptive and included likely scavenging. Multivariate analyses found the most important predictors of diet variability in S. acanthias were year, bottom temperature, longitude, and fish weight. The diet of the nine other commonly caught squaliforme sharks was reviewed, and the spatial and depth distribution of all species on Chatham Rise described from research bottom trawl survey catches. The eleven species had a variety of different diets, and depth and location preferences, consistent with niche separation to reduce interspecific competition. Four trophic groups were identified, characterised by: mesopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroselachus crepidater, D. calcea, and Etmopterus lucifer); mesopelagic and benthopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroscymnus owstoni, Etmopterus baxteri); demersal and benthic fishes (Centrophorus squamosus, Dalatias licha, Proscymnodon plunketi); and a generalist diet of fishes and invertebrates (S. acanthias). The trophic levels of the species in each of the four groups were estimated as 4.18-4.24, 4.20-4.23, 4.24-4.48, and 3.84 respectively. The diet of Oxynotus bruniensis and Squalus griffini are unknown. The different niches occupied by different species are likely to influence their vulnerability to bottom trawl fisheries. Some species may benefit from fisheries through an increased availability of scavenged prey.

AB  - In Tunisia, elasmobranch landings have decreased substantially in recent years. Generally, species-specific information is largely unavailable for artisanal fisheries, but it is essential to increase knowledge and to ensure proper management of these species. This study analysed elasmobranch catches with longline fishery in the Gulf of Gabès. In total, 21 and 20 pelagic and bottom longline fishing trips were conducted, respectively, from July to September in 2007 and 2008. A total of eight elasmobranch species were caught: four batoids and four sharks. Pelagic longline captures were hooked externally while a high number of individuals captured with bottom longline were hooked internally. Discards due essentially to low commercial value and size represented 7.6% of total number of elasmobranch specimens caught. Longline landings in the Gulf of Gabès were principally composed of sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus , representing, respectively, 94.14% and 21.17% in number of pelagic and bottom longline captures. The importance of rhinobatids and Mustelus capture with bottom longline reflect their abundance in this area compared to other Mediterranean zones. Juveniles, including neonates with umbilical scars, dominated carcharhnids specimens, while smoothhound and guitarfish captures were dominated by mature individuals. Mitigation measures based on gear modifications, size limits and delineated nursery areas in the Gulf of Gabès should be developed to protect these vulnerable species.

AB  - Pelagic fishes are well known to aggregate in large numbers under floating objects and this behavior is frequently exploited by purse seine fisheries targeting tunas. Non-target species (e.g., sharks) are often caught as well, but they are typically discarded as they do not have sufficient commercial value. To investigate the total mortality of pelagic sharks in the equatorial Eastern Pacific Ocean associated with the tuna purse seine fishery deploying drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs), we measured rates of at-vessel mortality and deployed pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) to monitor post-release survival and behavior. Between 2011 and 2012, at-vessel mortality rate ranged from 15% to 70%, and total mortality rate (i.e. the combination of at-vessel and post-release mortalities) ranged from 80% to 95%. Taken together, our findings document the high mortality of sharks incidentally captured in the tuna purse seine fishery that employs drifting FADs, indicate a correlation to set size, and suggest the need to develop methods that minimize shark bycatch in this fishery.

AB  - Electronic monitoring (EM) has the capacity to collect fisheries-dependent data to support fisheries management decision-making. Following successful pilot studies, EM was introduced into several Australian Commonwealth fisheries in 2015, including the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) and the Gillnet, Hook and Trap (GHAT) sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). We compared two years of EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook data from the ETBF and GHAT sector to examine the level of congruence in reporting of both retained and discarded catch and protected species interactions. In general, congruence between EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook data in both the ETBF and GHAT sector was higher for retained than for discarded catch, and the ETBF had a higher level of data equivalency than the GHAT sector. Fishery-wide estimates of congruence, however, concealed a large amount of variation among individual and groups of species. EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook data were highly congruent for some species (e.g. tunas, swordfish and gummy shark), but for others there were clear taxonomic (e.g. escolar and rudderfish), identification (e.g. sharks, marlins) and reporting (e.g. draughtboard shark and elephantfish) issues, which reduced overall congruence. There was evidence of increased congruence through time, particularly for discarded bycatch species in the GHAT sector, due presumably to increased manager feedback and communication with fishers on their logbook reporting. While EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook interactions with protected species in the GHAT sector were equivalent, this was not the case for species other than seabirds in the ETBF. In the ETBF, a greater number of interactions were reported by fishers in their logbooks, suggesting a need to modify existing or install additional EM technology to improve on-board vision for the EM analyst. It is important to review the performance of any integrated EM system through time to ensure it is fulfilling the data requirements for the fishery and meeting the overall objectives of the program.

AB  - Technological advancement has allowed for consideration of electronic monitoring (EM) as a tool for improving the accuracy of logbook data and/or increasing the quantity of fishery-dependent data collected. In Australia, an integrated EM system was implemented in several managed fisheries, including the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) and the Gillnet Hook and Trap (GHAT) sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) from 1 July 2015. We compare logbook data from the first two years of EM operation to the previous six years, to measure changes in reported nominal catch and discard per unit effort (CPUE and DPUE) and interactions with protected species per-unit-effort (IPUE). We observed no significant increase in CPUE between non-EM (2009–2014) and EM (2015 and 2016) years for any species group in both the ETBF and GHAT. In contrast, DPUE increased significantly during the EM years for target, byproduct and bycatch species in the ETBF and for target species in the GHAT sector. There was a significant increase in the IPUE for seabirds, marine mammals and turtles in the ETBF and for dolphins and pinnipeds in the GHAT sector. While not discounting possible environmentally-driven shifts in availability and abundance, as well as individual vessel effects, the weight of evidence suggests the use of an integrated EM system has led to significant changes in logbook reporting of discarded catch and protected species interactions, particularly in the ETBF. Assuming this supposition is valid, we identify fishery-specific factors that might have influenced reporting behaviour.

AB  - Sharks are one of the most threatened groups of marine animals because of high exploitation rates coupled with low resilience to fishing pressure. We provide information on the current status of the young sharks caught in fishing nets in Iskenderun and Mersin Bays in the eastern Mediterranean, based on fishery-dependent surveys conducted between 2010 and 2021. Sharks were found in bycatches in trawling nets, trammel nets, bottom longlines and fishing lines. Incidental captures of young-of-the-year or juvenile specimens (n=269) included 15 species and the data indicate that İskenderun and Mersin Bays may serve as a nursery ground for the new-born and young individuals especially for the Blackmouth Catshark (Galeus melastomus), the Lesser Spotted Dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula), and the Velvet Belly (Etmopterus spinax). If necessary measures are taken, bycatch can be reduced to a certain limit, or even eliminated for shark species in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Given the increasingly extensive use of drifting fish aggregation devices (FADs) by the purse-seine fisheries targeting tropical tunas, fishing effort restrictions have been introduced to manage tropical tuna stocks. However, these measures are focused on the protection of juvenile tunas and do not take account of the potential impact on bycatch or associated megafauna (whales and whale sharks). An iterative “fishing-day” Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to investigate the consequences on tropical tunas and bycatch of introducing extensive area 6-month moratoria on FAD activities. The model allowed for variability in a range of plausible values of the parameters characterizing the fishing operations conducted by European purse-seiners in the eastern tropical Atlantic and western Indian Oceans for the period 2005–2014. Monte Carlo simulations, using probabilities based on these fishery data, were carried out for the French and Spanish fishing fleets separately to account for differences in fishing strategies. The models predicted a decrease in FAD sets and an increase in free school sets. As a consequence, the catch of small tuna (<10 kg) decreased while the catch of large tuna (≥10 kg) increased, leading to an overall increase in tuna catch of 100–200 tons/year/vessel in the Atlantic Ocean, and a decrease of 400–1500 tons/year/vessel in the Indian Ocean. The bycatch decreased in the Indian Ocean, while in the Atlantic Ocean billfishes, turtles and chondrichthyans bycatch increased slightly and other bony fishes decreased. Because fishing practices were modified, whale and whale shark associated sets increased slightly in the Indian Ocean.

AB  - Time–area regulations have been introduced to manage stocks of tropical tuna, given the increased use of drifting fish aggregation devices (FADs). However, the consequences in terms of changes in fishing strategies and effort reallocation may not always be as expected. For instance, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, previous studies have highlighted that the increase use of FAD-fishing following the demand for tuna caught without dolphin mortality has raised concerns about the bycatch and the capture of juvenile tuna. In the tropical eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, this study aimed to (1) assess, using before–after analysis, the consequences of previous time–area regulations on FAD sets on the fishing effort allocated to megafauna associated sets, and (2) evaluate through Monte Carlo simulations the potential effect of new regulations banning whale or/and whale shark associated sets. Firstly, we showed that previous time–area regulations, which were mainly implemented during seasons with few whale and whale shark associated sets, generally had thus little effect on the number of megafauna associated sets. Secondly, some simulations, particularly when both whale and whale shark associated sets were banned, predicted consequences of changes in fishing strategy. Indeed, these types of ban could lead to an increase in the number of FAD and free school sets but no change in the tuna catch, as well as a slight decrease in bycatch. These results indicate that an ecosystem approach to fisheries, by taking into account megafauna associated sets and bycatch, should thus be adopted when implementing management or conservation measures.

AB  - In an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) framework of the tuna purse-seine fishery, the assessment of target species, but also that of bycatch species, is essential. In the Atlantic and Indian oceans, purse-seine nets are sometimes set around tuna schools associated with whale sharks and baleen whales, although less frequently than around free-swimming tuna schools or those associated with fish aggregating devices (FAD). However, knowledge on the targeted catch and bycatch in these megafauna associated fishing sets is still relatively limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess species and size composition of the target tuna species, as well as the diversity of bycatch species in whale and whale shark associated sets. Whale associated sets were found to be very similar to free school sets in terms of tuna catch (large yellowfin tuna), bycatch occurrence (presence in half the sets) and species assemblage (alpha and beta diversity). Whale shark associated sets were intermediate between FAD and free school sets, with tuna catch (skipjack and juvenile yellowfin) closer to FAD than to free school sets. However, the presence of large yellowfin, the bycatch composition (with almost no finfish, abundantly captured in FAD sets) and the species assemblage showed similarity with free school sets. This study highlights the need for an EAFM in the tuna purse-seine fishery by providing knowledge on pelagic multi-specific catches and bycatches.

AB  - Argentina is one of the countries with the largest overall landings of skates and rays (24 000 t/year). As a consequence of high levels of exploitation and deficient management tools, many of these species are threatened with extinction. In the bottom trawl fishery of San Matías Gulf, northern Patagonia, skates and rays are caught as bycatch and all have historically been recorded in the fishery logbook under the category “rays”. Therefore, species composition and their characteristics were unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the commercial exploitation of batoid species in this fishery. Our results indicate that commercial landings include nine species of skate, six of which are common. Among these, Atlantoraja platana, Sympterygia bonapartii and Dipturus chilensis were considered the main species of this fishery. Their combined relative abundance and weight made up about 90% of the batoid catch throughout the year. Sexual segregation was detected in four species in which individuals of one sex dominated commercial landings. The commercial fraction was composed of individuals with a wide range of sizes. Immature individuals could represent 90% of the individuals landed for some species. At present, lack of data prevents us from quantifying the impact that this fishery is having on these species, but our findings highlight the importance of conducting research surveys to assess the abundance and geographic extent of these populations. The information presented here provided the basis for the proposal of a new logbook format incorporating species-level identification. The new logbook was implemented on 1 January 2010.

AB  - Expanding coastal fisheries into deeper waters is frequently tabled as an option to increase harvests from the sea in the Southwest Indian Ocean. In this region, only Mozambique and South Africa have established deep-water trawl fisheries for mixed crustaceans. To investigate the fishery potential of deep shelf waters over a broader geographical extent, four bottom trawl surveys were undertaken, in Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya, respectively, in 2011–2012. Teleosts dominated catches in all surveys (59–74% of total catches) and depths. Crustaceans made up 15% of the catch in Mozambique and Madagascar, but only 6% in Kenya and Tanzania, where elasmobranchs (18%) and other invertebrates (11–15%) were more abundant. A generalized linear model was constructed to quantify the effects of country, depth and day/night on the abundance of four common crustacean species. Abundance of Haliporoides triarthrus and Metanephrops mozambicus declined from south (Madagascar, Mozambique) to north (Kenya, Tanzania), but Heterocarpus woodmasoni was more abundant in Madagascar, Tanzania and Kenya. Chaceon macphersoni and H. triarthrus abundance increased up to 600 m depth, whereas M. mozambicus and H. woodmasoni peaked shallower, at 350–500 m. Crustacean catch composition in Mozambique was strikingly similar to commercial landings in eastern South Africa, supporting a distinct sub-region for fisheries management, but differed markedly across the Mozambique Channel. Deep-water crustaceans were less abundant in Kenya and Tanzania, with limited commercial appeal. New deep-water trawl fisheries will have to contend with significant teleost bycatch.

AB  - Sharks are commonly caught in Indonesian waters both by target fisheries and as bycatch. Fishers targeting sharks mostly employ drift longlines, whereas tuna longlines and gillnets are the gear mostly responsible for shark bycatch. Our studies on shark fisheries have been conducted since 2006 and have focused on the eastern Indian Ocean region, the most exploited area in Indonesian waters. Sharks are mostly landed as bycatch in the tuna fishery (using longlines and gillnets) in Cilacap, Central Java province, and as targeted catch by the pelagic shark fishery at Tanjung Luar (Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara province), one of the largest targeted shark fisheries in Indonesia. Eight years (2006–2013) of monthly shark bycatch data from the fishing port at Cilacap and one year (February 2012–January 2013) of daily catch data from Tanjung Luar were analysed to determine their respective contributions to shark landings in Indonesia's Eastern Indian Ocean Fisheries Management Region. A total catch of 1 364 t of sharks was recorded at Cilacap, with an average monthly catch of 14.2 t (SD 18.5). A total of 1 426 sharks were recorded at Tanjung Luar, with an average daily catch of five individuals. Whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae) were the most commonly caught in both fisheries, consisting primarily of silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis in the targeted fishery and blue sharks Prionace glauca in the tuna fishery. Overall, the Cilacap bycatch contributed 4.7% of the annual shark landings in the region. In 2012, the fishery at Tanjung Luar contributed 5.2% of the regional shark landings. The relatively low recorded contributions of these two fisheries may be inaccurate and may reflect double‑counting at the provincial level. Given the different shark species composition, the two fisheries require different management and conservation strategies to be included in Indonesia's National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (NPOA‑Sharks).

AB  - Bycatch of rays and skates in towed fishing gears represents one of the major threats to these relatively slow-growing marine species. The objective of this study was to modify ground gear in a bottom trawl fishery to increase the escape of these species during towing without associated loss of target catch. Sea trials were carried out with a research vessel in Mersin Bay, North-eastern Mediterranean. Experimental ground gear was modified by cutting the rigging twine between the fishing line and the footrope in the central part of the ground gear. Capture of three unwanted bycatch species were estimated. The probability of capture of guitarfish (Rhinobatos sp.) and common stingray (Dasyatis pastinaca) was significantly reduced to 8% and 20% for guitarfish and stingray, respectively compared to standard ground gear. The results for spiny butterfly ray (Gymnura altavela) were inconclusive due to the wide confidence intervals. Further, the catch comparison results for five out of six target species investigated did not show significant reduction in catch efficiency when using experimental gear compared to the standard trawl. Only for common sole (Solea solea) the modified trawl had significantly lower catch efficiency than the standard trawl. We believe that this technical measure for reducing unwanted bycatch in bottom trawls has a potential to be adopted by the fishery due to being an efficient, low-cost measure which does not create additional challenges during handling of the gear.

AB  - Deep-water sharks are highly diverse, vulnerable, and understudied as a group, despite the increasing pressures on their populations. Twenty-five species of deep-water sharks have been recorded in the Azores, an oceanic archipelago in the mid-North Atlantic, that are regularly caught as bycatch in hook-and-line fisheries. Avoiding the bycatch of deep-water sharks presents multiple challenges due to their high catchability, difficulties in correctly identifying species, and the general lack of data on these species. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies from the region, providing an up-to-date science-based framework for mitigating bycatch effects of Azorean hook-and-line fisheries. Several depth-based, area-based, and gear-based measures have been studied that demonstrate the potential to either avoid or increase the survival of deep-water shark bycatch. However, these measures may have limited efficacy for some species (e.g. highly mobile species) and thus, limited widespread applicability. Convincing fishers to avoid deep-water shark bycatch is also a challenge given the antagonistic interactions with sharks damaging the catch and fishing gear, while simultaneously a market incentive for shark liver oil remains. It highlights the need to proactively engage fishers and incentivize the mitigation of bycatch of deep-water sharks in Azorean waters.

AB  - In contrast to the vast majority of European maritime territories, the Azores is an isolated oceanic archipelago in the North East Atlantic characterised by small-scale hooks-and-lines fisheries. Yet, in spite of the low environmental impact of such fishing gears, there is no solid integrative information on the discard practices. This study bridges this gap by providing a comprehensive, historic overview of catch and associated discarding from major Azorean fisheries. An estimated catch of 1.02 million tonnes was taken in the Azores EEZ during the 1950–2014 period, of which only 5.0% were discarded (avg. 784 t/year). In recent years, discards were mostly attributable to the bottom longline (447 t/year, 10.3% of total catch) and artisanal purse-seine (270 t/year, 13.0%) fisheries. Discarding in the Azorean pelagic longlining fleet was also high (246.3 t/year, 43.6%) due to low retention of sharks on board, as opposed to that of the foreign and mainland fleets. The overall low amount of discards in the Azorean fisheries is the result of a high fishing selectivity combined with wide catch utilization. However, the upcoming European Landing Obligation could still have detrimental impacts on these fisheries. Further, some bycatch of protected/prohibited species occasionally occurs and could become a conservation issue if not carefully monitored.

AB  - Elasmobranchs, and particularly skates (Rajiforms), are commonly caught in fisheries worldwide as targeted catch or bycatch. Their life history traits make them particularly sensitive to elevated fishing mortality, especially in slow-growing deep-sea species. Knowledge of their ecology is key to ensure effective conservation and mitigation measures, especially dietary references to understand trophic relationships within the ecosystem. This study presents the first comprehensive description of diet composition and trophic position of two skate species (Bathyraja eatonii and B. irrasa) caught as bycatch in the French Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (Kerguelen waters). Stomach content and stable isotopic analyses were performed on both species according to sex and maturity stage. DNA barcoding analysis was performed on prey tissue samples to identify or confirm identification of prey items found in stomachs. Overall, both skate species were generalist feeders with high δ15N values. The higher δ15N values of B. irrasa result in a higher estimated trophic position than B. eatonii. The diet of B. eatonii mainly consisted of fish, pelagic crustaceans and squids, while B. irrasa preyed more on benthic crustaceans, fish and annelids. While sex had no effect on diet and trophic position for both species, maturity stage influenced the prey composition of B. irrasa. Annelids and isopods were prevalent in the stomachs of immature individuals of B. irrasa, while mature individuals fed more on decapods and fish. Our results revealed a wide range of prey items for these two generalist predators (>57 species). Understanding the diet, trophic position and trophic relationships of B. eatonii and B. irrasa is critical to a better comprehension of the impact of the exploitation of top predators on the subantarctic demersal ecosystem.

AB  - This study identified the discard species generated by the crab gillnet for targeting the blue swimming crab Portunus pelagicus (Linnaeus 1758) in the Banyuasin estuarine of South Sumatra, Indonesia. The fishing gear yielded the discarded catch about 12% (25.68 kg) of the total catch in weight (212.68 kg). For the discarded catch, 703 individuals represented 18 species from 3 phyla (Arthropoda, Chordata, and Mollusca). The crustaceans Charybdis helleri (Milne-Edwards 1867), Clibanarius spp., Matuta planipes(Fabricius 1798), and Libinia dubia(Milne Edwards 1834) were the majority components of these discards accounted for 90% of the total discards. Results of ecological classification rare, i.e., Chiloscyllium indicum(Gmelin 1789), and occasional, i.e., Chiloscyllium punctatum(Müller & Henle 1838), and Maculabatis macrura(Bleeker 1852) included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list as Vulnerable (C. indicum), Near Threatened (C. punctatum), and Endangered (M. macrura) category. Based on the IUCN status, two species of crustaceans i.e., Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda (Latreille 1802) and Tachypleus gigas (Müller 1785) listed as ‘Data Deficient’. Discarded on crab gillnet fishing in Banyuasin waters is a challenge for species that need to be conserved (shark, ray, and horseshoe crabs). Species with IUCN red list status ranging from Data Deficient to Endangered were found dead, except for horseshoe crabs. Mitigation options offered include captive breeding of horseshoe crabs, the release of protected species when caught, and fishing gear modification. These findings can help design suitable mitigations for discarding crab gill nets.

AB  - Bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) are increasingly being used in prawn trawl fisheries worldwide. This paper describes an experiment with a Nordmøre grid and a square-mesh panel on a prawn trawler off Moçambique. Although numbers of hauls that caught elasmobranchs were low, 75% of hauls with grids caught fewer large rays than those without grids; hauls using grids caught no large sharks at all. In its final configuration, the grid respectively reduced prawn, discard and retained fish catches by 5%, 25% and 32% relative to control hauls; the square-mesh panel increased prawn catches by 3% and respectively reduced discard and retained fish catches by 23% and 18% relative to control hauls. Changes in prawn catches were not statistically significant; however, when the grid and the square-mesh panel were used together, they reduced prawn, discard and retained fish catches by 25%, 47% and 26% respectively relative to control hauls (all significant except for retained fish catches). Overall, the Nordmøre grid successfully released large elasmobranchs, and the grid and the square-mesh panel individually reduced bycatch without reducing prawn catches. In combination, the two BRDs also reduced bycatch, but at the cost of substantially reduced prawn catches. The results indicate that there is scope for the wider use of BRDs on prawn trawlers in the Western Indian Ocean region, although this would require increased support from management agencies and industry.

AB  - The bigeye thresher, Alopias supercilious, is commonly caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries targeting swordfish. Little information is yet available on the biology of this species, however. As part of an ongoing study, observers sent aboard fishing vessels have been collecting set of information that includes samples of vertebrae, with the aim of investigating age and growth of A. supercilious. A total of 117 specimens were sampled between September 2008 and October 2009 in the tropical northeastern Atlantic, with specimens ranging from 101 to 242 cm fork length (FL) (176 to 407 cm total length). The A. supercilious vertebrae were generally difficult to read, mainly because they were poorly calcified, which is typical of Lamniformes sharks. Preliminary trials were carried out to determine the most efficient band enhancement technique for this species, in which crystal violet section staining was found to be the best methodology. Estimated ages in this sample ranged from 2 to 22 years for females and 1 to 17 years for males. A version of the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGF) re-parameterised to estimate L0, and a modified VBGF using a fixed L0 were fitted to the data. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare these models. The VBGF produced the best results, with the following parameters: Linf = 293 cm FL, k = 0.06 y–1 and L0 = 111 cm FL for females Linf = 206 cm FL, k = 0.18 y–1 and L0 = 93 cm FL for males. The estimated growth coefficients confirm that A. supercilious is a slow-growing species, highlighting its vulnerability to fishing pressure. It is therefore urgent to carry out more biological research to inform fishery managers more adequately and address conservation issues.

AB  - The bigeye thresher (Alopias supercilious) is occasionally caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish. Still, it is one of the least known and studied of all pelagic sharks, which hinders assessment of the status of its populations. As part of an ongoing cooperative program for fisheries and biological data collection, information collected by fishery observers and through scientific projects from several nations that undertake fishing activities in the Atlantic (Japan, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, Uruguay and US) was compiled and analyzed. Datasets include information on location, size, sex and, in some cases, maturity stage. A total of 5590 bigeye thresher records collected between 1992 and 2013 were compiled, with sizes ranging from 70 to 305 cm fork length (FL). Considerable variability was observed in size, with tropical regions recording a smaller mean size compared to other regions. The distribution of juvenile and adult specimens also showed considerable variability, and the sex ratios varied between regions and size classes. Median sizes at maturity were estimated at 208.6 cm FL for females and 159.2 cm FL for males. Pregnant females were recorded in the tropical northeast and southwest Atlantic, with these regions possibly serving as nursery areas. The biological and distributional patterns presented in this study provide a better understanding of different aspects of this species in the Atlantic, which can help managers adopt more informed and efficient conservation measures.

AB  - The incidental bycatch of sea turtle in tuna and swordfish fisheries is currently recognized as one of the major threats to the populations of these species. Therefore a number of mitigation measures have been tested, particularly for longline fisheries targeting swordfish. As mitigation measures may also affect the fish catches, it is important to quantify these impacts both at the ecological and socio-economic levels. Between August 2008 and December 2011, a total of 202 experimental pelagic longline sets were carried out in the Tropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean. The combination J-hook baited with squid (traditionally used by the fishery) was compared against two circle hooks (one non-offset and one with 10° offset) and mackerel bait. Catches per unit effort (CPUE) were calculated and compared between the different hook style and bait combinations for all target, bycatch and discarded fish species. In addition, a GLM (generalized linear model) was applied for swordfish Xiphias gladius and blue shark Prionace glauca (two main target species) and bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus (most discarded species). The swordfish catches were negatively affected when changing from the traditional gear (J-style hooks baited with squid) to one of the experimental combinations, with the bait type having a stronger influence than the hook style on this reduction. However, the overall target species CPUE and the value of the retained catch (VPUE, value per unit of effort) were not significantly affected, due to an increase on the blue shark CPUE. Furthermore, the hook style and the bait type did not seem to influence the at-haulback mortality rates of most discarded species, which were highly species-specific. Given the apparent lack of impact on the overall value of the retained catch, the use of circle hooks baited with mackerel on this particular fishery and region would be highly beneficial for sea turtle conservation, without affecting the economic viability of the fishery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Expanding fisheries in developing nations like Sri Lanka have a significant impact on threatened marine species such as elasmobranchs. Manta and devil (mobulid) rays have some of the most conservative life history strategies of any elasmobranch, and even low to moderate levels of bycatch from gillnet fisheries may lead to significant population declines. A lack of information on life history, demographics, population trends, and fisheries impacts hinders effective management measures for these species. METHOD: We report on mobulid fishery landings over nine years between 2011 and 2020 across 38 landing sites in Sri Lanka. We collected data on catch numbers, body sizes, sex, and maturity status for five mobulid species. We used a Bayesian state-space model to estimate monthly country-wide catch rates and total annual landings of mobulid rays. We used catch curve analyses to estimate total mortality for <i>Mobula mobular</i>, and evaluated trends in recorded body sizes across the study period for <i>M. mobular, M. birostris, M. tarapacana</i> and <i>M. thurstoni</i>. RESULTS: We find that catch rates have declined an order of magnitude for all species across the study period, and that total annual captures of mobulid rays by the Sri Lankan artisanal fishing fleet exceed the estimated annual captures of mobulids in all global, industrial purse seine fisheries combined. Catch curve analyses suggest that <i>M. mobular</i> is being fished at rates far above the species' intrinsic population growth rate, and the average sizes of all mobulids in the fishery except for <i>M. birostris</i> are declining. Collectively, these findings suggest overfishing of mobulid ray populations in the northern Indian Ocean by Sri Lankan artisanal fisheries. We recommend strengthening the management of these species through improved implementation of CITES, CMS, and regional fisheries management actions. In addition, we report on the demographic characteristics of mobulids landed in Sri Lanka and provide the first record of <i>M. eregoodoo</i> in the country.

AB  - Oceanic juvenile loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta , foraging in Azorean waters, are incidentally caught in drifting longlines that target swordfish, Xiphias gladius , and blue shark, Prionace glauca . Data were recorded during a longline gear modification experiment conducted in 2000. The results show that the captures are not uniformly distributed in relation to fishing effort, with 81% of the loggerheads (N = 232) caught in one-third of the sets (N = 93). The highest turtle catch rates were around the eastern group of islands, an area characterized by the presence of mesoscale eddies induced by bathymetric features. High catch rates coincided with the presence of the thermohaline front, between August and October, and when targeting blue shark. To investigate the causes of these differences we fitted a general linear model to evaluate the influence of mean depth, minimum depth, sea surface temperature (SST), soak area, soak time, moon phase and wind force on turtle and target species catch rates. These results revealed that mean depth and SST were most important for loggerhead catch rates, while minimum depth was the only significant variable for swordfish and mean depth, SST, wind force, moon phase and soak time influenced blue shark catches. The distribution of loggerhead sea turtles can be predicted by monitoring fishing areas in relation to bathymetry and SST. The impact of longline fishing could be greatly and quickly reduced by regulating the blue shark fishery and by increasing fishermen awareness for sea turtle conservation.

AB  - Fisheries are recognised as a major threat to sea turtles worldwide. Oceanic driftnets are considered the main cause of the steep decline in Pacific Ocean populations of the leatherback sea turtle Dermochelys coriacea. The world’s largest leatherback population nests in West Africa and migrates across the Atlantic Ocean to feed off the South American coast. There, the turtles encounter a range of fisheries, including the Brazilian driftnet fishery targeting hammerhead sharks. From 2002 to 2008, 351 sea turtles were incidentally caught in 41 fishing trips and 371 sets. Leatherbacks accounted for 77.3% of the take (n = 252 turtles, capture rate = 0.1405 turtles/km of net), followed by loggerheads Caretta caretta (47 individuals, capture rate = 0.0262 turtles/km of net), green turtles Chelonia mydas (27 individuals, capture rate = 0.0151 turtles/km of net) and unidentified hard-shelled turtles (25 individual, capture rate = 0.0139 turtles/km of net) that fell off the net during hauling. Immediate mortality (i.e., turtles that were dead upon reaching the vessel, excluding post-release mortality) was similar among the species and accounted for 22.2 to 29.4% of turtles hauled onboard. The annual catch by this fishery ranged from 1,212 to 6,160 leatherback turtles, as estimated based on bootstrap procedures under different fishing effort scenarios in the 1990s. The present inertia in law and enforcement regarding gillnet regulations in Brazil could result in the reestablishment of the driftnet fishery, driving rates of leatherback mortality to levels similar to those observed in previous decades. This development could potentially lead to the collapse of the South Atlantic leatherback population, mirroring the decline of the species in the Pacific. In light of these potential impacts and similar threats to other pelagic mega fauna, we recommend banning this type of fishery in the region.

AB  - The silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis regularly associates with floating objects in the open ocean, resulting in relatively high levels of bycatch in industrial tuna purse seine fisheries using drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs). This bycatch has contributed to concerns regarding the sustainability of this fishery and its impact on silky shark populations. To investigate fishery interactions, movements of 28 silky sharks (86–235 cm TL, mean = 118 cm) fitted with pop-up and archival tags in the western Indian Ocean, between 2010 and 2012, were examined. Monthly overlap between probability surfaces of sharks and two fishery metrics (FAD-tuna catches and FAD positions) were calculated. Vertical habitat use overlapped almost entirely with operational gear depth. Horizontal movements were extensive (3–5024 km) and covered large areas of the western Indian Ocean. Monthly overlap with FAD distributions was consistently high (64.03–100%) highlighting the need for compliance with FAD design regulations to avoid entanglement. Monthly overlap with tuna catches was more variable (8.43–51.83%). The observed movement patterns suggest static spatial management measures would be have limited conservation impact, however dynamic approaches could be appropriate. Limiting fishery activities directly will likely have the greatest conservation outcomes for silky sharks in the purse seine fishery.

AB  - Increasing catch rates are considered the main impact of dynamic fisheries practices on marine ecosystems, but other effects can be equally important and are often ignored. Here we quantify a major, previously unknown source of shark mortality: entanglement in drifting fish aggregating devices, now widely used in the global tropical tuna purse‐seine fishery. Using satellite tagging and underwater observational data, we developed two novel, independent, and complementary approaches, which quantify and highlight the scale of this problem. Entanglement mortality of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) in the Indian Ocean was 5–10 times that of the known bycatch of this imperiled species from the region's purse‐seine fleet. More importantly, these estimates from a single ocean (480 000–960 000 silky sharks) mirror those from all world fisheries combined (400 000–2 million silky sharks), a situation that clearly requires immediate management intervention and extensive monitoring.

AB  - Silky sharks, Carcharhinus falciformis (Müller and Henle, 1839), are the primary elasmobranch bycatch species in tuna purse seine fisheries throughout the world's major oceans. Juveniles of this species commonly associate with drifting fish aggregating devices (Fads) deployed to enhance tuna catches in these fisheries. Here we present results from the first investigation into the behavior of juvenile silky sharks associated with drifting Fads in the western indian ocean. A total of 10 silky sharks were tagged with coded acoustic transmitters around drifting Fads equipped with acoustic receivers. Following release, all sharks undertook an excursion away from the Fad with which they were associated. Two individuals were subsequently never detected, while the initial absence period of the eight detected sharks ranged between 0.1 and 3.5 d. After returning, total association times averaged 5.19 d (sd = 3.15 d) and related horizontal movement rates ranged from 8 to 50 km d–1. Short excursions away from the Fad were undertaken by some individuals, all of which lasted a few hours and were made at night. During periods of association, silky sharks typically occupied the upper 35 m of the water column for the majority of the observation period. These results provide new insights into our understanding of associative behaviors. Further studies are needed to improve assessment of the impacts of Fads on the ecology of this species, a major concern considering the large number of Fads deployed.

AB  - For animals discarded after fishing capture (unwanted bycatch), the effects of fishing-capture stress can extend beyond immediate or delayed death, causing long-term, sub-lethal effects such as injuries and physiological, behavioral, immune, energetic, and reproductive consequences. Given the importance of successful reproduction for population recruitment, investigating reproductive impairment is essential, even more so for animals with low reproductive rates such as chondrichthyans. However, data for these species are lacking, even though the poor conservation status of many chondrichthyan populations and the threats from overexploitation and discard require a better understanding of fishing-capture stress consequences. In this study, we investigated the reproductive consequences of trawling and air exposure stress when experienced by southern fiddler rays (Trygonorrhina dumerilii) during late pregnancy, with a focus on neonatal traits. Compared with neonates from unstressed mothers, neonates born from mothers subjected to capture simulation had significantly lower body mass and yolk sac volume at birth, showed a granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio indicative of a stressed condition, reduced growth, altered burying behavior, reduced boldness, and swam for shorter distances after a simulated predator attack. Smaller size and lower growth rate might expose neonates to a higher rate of predation, and similarly, the altered burying and swimming behaviors may reduce their ability to escape from predators. Decreased boldness could impact neonate survival by reducing their ability to compete and obtain food and resources. Further investigations are needed, but these initial results suggest that capture stress suffered by pregnant rays may alter traits and survival of their offspring with consequences for recruitment and population abundance.

AB  - Longline fishing utilizes monofilament lines that can be as much as 62 miles long. The line itself is buoyed by Styrofoam or plastic floats. Usually, at about every 100ft, a secondary line is attached and hangs down from the mainline. The lines are baited with mackerel, squid, or shark meat and have as many as 10,000 hooks. Every 12-24 hours, the line is hauled in, mechanically rebaited, and set back into the water behind the vessel. The baited hooks can be seen by albatross and other seabirds as they are placed in the water or being hauled out. When the birds dive for the bait, they are hooked, dragged behind the fishing boat, and drown. Spectacularly nonselective, longline fishing techniques also hook many other forms of marine life-"bycatch" (sea turtles, seals, dolphins, penguins, sharks, and many other nontarget finfish). It is estimated that 300,000 seabirds (including 100,000 albatross) die on longlines each year. Albatross are among the longest-lived birds. They can live up to 60 years and some species do not start breeding until they are 10 years old. They have a low reproductive rate and many species only breed every other year. In addition, a species like the Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) rears its chicks for an average of more than 270 days. Albatross pair for life and may take years to find a new partner if their mate is killed. Owing to their incredibly low reproductive rate, albatross are particularly vulnerable to longline fishing. Currently, it is believed that 4 albatross drown per 100,000 hooks set. This is more than 400 birds a week. The current mortality rate for adult birds is not sustainable and for some species, the birds are dying faster that they can repopulate. Currently, 19 of the world's 22 albatross species are threatened with extinction. This year longline fishing ships will set 10 billion hooks worldwide. Various mitigation measures (bird-scaring lines, weighted, faster-sinking line, setting lines deeper out of the bird's sight, reduction in the amount of offal discarded from fishing boats, night fishing, and restriction of longline operations from areas where nesting and foraging birds are congregated during the breeding season, among others) have been proposed and attempted. There is no one panacea for the effects of longlining and mitigation efforts are most successful when used in combination. Some of these mitigation measures have shown very promising results. Some experts feel that government legislation, regulation, and enforcement in conjunction with incentives for the fishing industry to incorporate and implement mitigating techniques have the best chance in ameliorating the problem. The public is surprisingly unaware of this wanton and wasteful exploitation of the ocean's resources, and the worldwide demand for seafood continues to rise. Meanwhile, globally, fishermen voice the same complaints: fewer fish, smaller fish, shorter fishing seasons, bizarre developments in their seasonal appearance and dispersal, and fewer overall species seen. These are all the classic signs of overfishing. Each year it is estimated that some 90 million tons of wild fish are harvested from our planet's oceans. Nearly 30 million tons of this is discarded as the incidental bycatch of nontarget species. If international curbs are not placed upon wasteful fishing practices, we are doomed to learn a painful maxim. "The ocean is not infinite." Veterinarians must become involved in worldwide conservation efforts, acting locally, while thinking globally.

AB  - High incidental catches of Greenland shark (<i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>) in Nunavut's Greenland halibut (<i>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</i>) fishery has led to studies on the feasibility of capturing Greenland halibut with baited pots. In this study, catch rates among six experimental pots are compared. In addition to this, underwater video observations of Greenland halibut interacting with two of these experimental pot types are quantified in order to help provide recommendations on future pot designs. Catch rates of Greenland halibut differed among pots with different entrance mesh types, and none of the pots produced substantial amounts of bycatch. Strings of pots were deployed within a narrow corridor between baited gillnets targeting Greenland halibut, which may have affected catch results. Video observations revealed Greenland halibut entangled by their teeth significantly more often in entrance funnels constructed with 50 mm than with 19 mm clear monofilament netting and the entrance rate was 45% higher with the 19 mm netting. Greenland halibut that successfully entered a pot repeatedly became entangled by their teeth in 58 mm netting used in the side and end panels and in a horizontal panel used to separate the pot into a lower and upper chamber. The majority (80%) of Greenland halibut were observed to approach a pot against the current. The downstream entrance was aligned with the current in 52% of the observed Greenland halibut approaches. Seventy percent of entry attempts and 67% of successful entries occurred when fish approached against the current and when the entrance was aligned with the current. These observations lead to recommendations that future studies consider developing a four entrance pot to ensure an entrance is always aligned with bottom currents. Based on these observations of entanglements, it is recommended to use 19 mm clear monofilament netting in the entrance funnel, 100 mm polyethylene netting in the exterior panels, and 19 mm polypropylene netting in the horizontal panel when targeting Greenland halibut. Three Greenland sharks were observed interacting with the pots in the video sets, but none were captured or damaged the pots during the potting experiments, providing validity to the use of pots to mitigate the capture of Greenland shark in Nunavut territorial waters.

AB  - This study provides a historical overview of the use of drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs) in purse seine fisheries since the early 1990s, using global tuna fisheries datasets from the four tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Tropical tuna purse seine fisheries typically target large yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tunas on free-swimming schools and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and juveniles of yellowfin and bigeye associated with drifting objects. DFADs have enabled global skipjack catches to markedly increase, and have also introduced major scientific issues for all tuna-RFMOs. In particular, they have strongly modified the fishing strategies of purse seiners that fish on a combination of free-swimming and DFAD-associated schools. Consequently, the cumulated search time traditionally used to quantify nominal fishing effort to assess the status of tuna stocks is inconsistent and cannot be used to derive time series of abundance indices from catch-per-unit of-effort (CPUE). In addition, the lack of information available on the construction, deployment, and use of DFADs has prevented effective monitoring of the fishing pressure over the last two decades exerted by purse seine fleets using this fishing mode. Juveniles of tropical tunas represent a substantial proportion of purse seine catch on DFADs in the three oceans, which has raised particular concern for some bigeye stocks that have been subject to overfishing in the past. Catches of juvenile tunas by DFAD fishing may also result in a decrease in recruitment for fisheries that target adult tunas such as longliners. In addition, some demographic parameters of tunas and other species associated with DFADs may be affected by the resultant habitat modification arising from the widespread deployment of DFADs. Evidence in the literature and provided by the ratio-estimator method suggest that fishing DFAD-associated schools may result in about 100 000 t of bycatch and discards annually. In addition, there is further potential for ghost fishing related mortality of sensitive species such as marine turtles and pelagic sharks. In this context and following a precautionary approach, we finally discuss the increasing need for all tuna-RFMOs to reduce, or at least monitor and control, the use of DFADs to mitigate their adverse effects not only on yellowfin and bigeye stocks but also on open-ocean ecosystems.

AB  - Estimating bycatch is essential for monitoring the ecological impacts of a fishery in order to set management and mitigation priorities. Purse seine vessels targeting tropical tunas incidentally catch pelagic sharks (mainly silky and oceanic whitetip sharks), which are brought onboard and can be observed on the upper and lower decks. Currently, single onboard observers can only be efficiently stationed on one of the two decks, and thus often rely on information provided by the crew to complement their bycatch estimations. In this study, we used dedicated scientists strategically positioned during fishing sets in order to establish a reference count of captured sharks during conventional commercial fishing trips. We then assessed the accuracy of the counts made by (i) single observers onboard during the same fishing trips in the Pacific Ocean (where observers' main duty is to estimate catch of target species and bycatch estimation is of a lower priority) and the Atlantic Ocean (where observers’ focus is on bycatch) and (ii) Electronic Monitoring System (EMS) in the Indian Ocean. A total of 74 fishing sets conducted during four purse seine fishing trips revealed that shark counts were underestimated for 50%–100% of the sets, with the mean shark count underestimation, at the fishing trip level, ranging from 9% to 40% (onboard observers) and 65% for EMS. Given the importance of monitoring populations of vulnerable species, we strongly encourage specific studies during which the complementary counts of two onboard observers are used simultaneously to assess the accuracy of various EMS configurations, bearing in mind that single onboard observers appear to underestimate the number of captured sharks.

AB  - Characterizing the vulnerability of both target and non-target (bycatch) species to a fishing gear is a key step towards an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach. This study addresses this issue for the tropical tuna purse seine fishery that uses fish aggregating devices (FADs). We used passive acoustic telemetry to characterize, on a 24 h scale, the associative patterns and the vertical distribution of skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) (target species), as well as silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), oceanic triggerfish (Canthidermis maculata), and rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) (major non-target species). Distinct diel associative patterns were observed; the tunas and the silky sharks were more closely associated with FADs during daytime, while the rainbow runner and the oceanic triggerfish were more closely associated during the night. Minor changes in bycatch to catch ratio of rainbow runner and oceanic triggerfish could possibly be achieved by fishing at FADs after sunrise. However, as silky sharks display a similar associative pattern as tunas, no specific change in fishing time could mitigate the vulnerability of this more sensitive species. For the vertical distribution, there was no particular time of the day when any species occurred beyond the depth of a typical purse seine net. While this study does not provide an immediate solution to reduce the bycatch to catch ratios of the FAD-based fishery in the western Indian Ocean, the method described here could be applied to other regions where similar fisheries exist so as to evaluate potential solutions to reducing fishing mortality of non-target species.

AB  - Research was conducted in 2002 and 2003 by noaa's national Marine fisheries service, southeast fisheries science center, to investigate changes in hook design and bait type to reduce the bycatch of sea turtles on pelagic longlines in the western north atlantic ocean. The effectiveness of 18/0–20/0 circle hooks and 10/0 Japanese tuna hooks with squid (Illex spp.) and mackerel bait (Scomber scombrus linnaeus, 1758) was evaluated against the industry standard 9/0 J-hooks with squid bait with respect to reducing sea turtle and shark interactions while maintaining swordfish (Xiphias gladius linnaeus, 1758) and tuna (Thunnus spp.) catch rates. In total, 973,734 hooks were deployed during the study. Individually, circle hooks and mackerel bait significantly reduced both loggerhead [Caretta caretta (linnaeus, 1758)] and leatherback [Dermochelys coriacea (vandelli, 1761)] sea turtle bycatch. The combination of 18/0 circle hooks with mackerel bait was even more effective for loggerhead sea turtles and had a significant increase in swordfish catch by weight. The combination 18/0 circle hooks with squid bait resulted in a significant decrease in the swordfish catch and a significant increase in the catch rate of blue shark [Prionace glauca (linnaeus, 1758)] , bluefin tuna [Thunnus thynnus (linnaeus, 1758)], and albacore tuna [Thunnus alalunga (bonnaterre, 1788)]. With all hook types, mackerel bait resulted in a significant decrease in blue shark, bigeye tuna [Thunnus obesus (lowe, 1839)], and albacore tuna, but significantly increased the catch of porbeagle [Lamna nasus (bonnaterre, 1788)] and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus rafinesque, 1810).

AB  - We investigated the effects of hook soak time on targeted reef species and shark bycatch in the reef fish bottom longline fishery in the Gulf of Mexico. Beginning in 2010, capture time and catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the primary target species red grouper (Epinephelus morio) in the fishery were evaluated using hook timers. Findings indicated that typical duration of hook soak times is longer than necessary to efficiently harvest red grouper and a reduction in gear soak times to less than one hour would result in minimal or no reduction in red grouper CPUE. The mean capture time of sharks and red grouper differed significantly, suggesting that a reduction in soak time would likely reduce the bycatch of sharks in the fishery. The study also revealed barometric pressure, lunar phase, and fish size were significant covariates with red grouper capture times and that different bait types significantly affected CPUE. Implementing shorter hook soak times would likely improve fishery profitability and potentially reduce discards of unwanted species in the fishery.

AB  - Abstract. Basking sharks occur throughout New Zealand, but are most common in cool temperate latitudes of 39–51°S. Inshore records from miscellaneous sources peaked in spring–summer, with few winter records. Two records were of sharks observed in a large brackish water lake. About 203 basking sharks were observed caught by commercial trawlers between 1986 and 1999. Multiple captures were common, including 14 in one tow. Most trawl-caught sharks were taken near or outside the 250 m depth contour, and 91% came from three small regions – East Coast (EC) and West Coast (WC) of South Island and Snares–Auckland Islands (SA). The highest catch (93 sharks) and catch rate (58 sharks per 1,000 tows) were from EC, where sharks were caught only in spring–summer. In SA, sharks were caught mainly in summer, and in WC all were caught in winter. The modal seabed depths for shark tows were 300–400 m at EC, 700–800 m at WC and 150–250 m at SA. Sharks were therefore caught in the deepest water in winter at WC. It was impossible to determine the actual depths of capture, but circumstantial evidence indicates that most sharks were caught on or near the bottom. The capture of some sharks in midwater in winter argues against hibernation, because hibernating sharks are unlikely to hover in midwater. Males dominated catches in all regions, particularly in WC and SA. In WC and SA, most sharks (94%) were 7–8 m long, whereas in EC most sharks (73%) were <7 m. Based on their lengths, many of the WC and SA males could have been mature, but most EC males were probably immature. Few of the females would have been mature. This study provides support for the hypothesis that basking sharks over-winter in deep water on the continental slope.

AB  - Tuna longline effort declined from 23—26 million hooks per year in 1979mdash;82 to 2mdash;4 million hooks per year in 1995mdash;98. Scientific observer coverage averaged 7.5%since 1988mdash;89, but increased in 1992mdash;93 (mean 23%). Observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the numbers of hooks set were used to estimate shark catches. Between 1988mdash;89 and 1997mdash;98,about 450 000 blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 65 000 porbeagles (Lamna nasus ) and 25 000 shortfin makos (Isurus oxyrinchus) were caught. In 1997mdash;98,about 45 000 blue sharks, 4000 porbeagles and 3000 makos were caught. Corresponding weight estimates were 1400 t, 150 t and 200 t. CPUE varied between foreign and domestic vessels, between north and south regions and among years, but there were no consistent temporal trends. Most males and females were immature, and most sharks were alive when recovered. Most sharks were processed, but usually only the fins were retained. The New Zealand tuna longline fishery is probably not seriously affecting pelagic shark stocks, but adequate assessment is not currently feasible. Accurate monitoring of Pacific Ocean catches is an important first step towards ensuring sustainability of their populations.

AB  - A wide range of pelagic predators survive in the open ocean, yet little is known about how they use that environment. Much of the current information on these species comes from studies in shelf waters, and it is not clear how representative the results are of their oceanic lifestyle. We used pop-up satellite tags to explore the horizontal and vertical use of the open ocean by porbeagle sharks (Lamna nasus) in the south-west Pacific Ocean and to identify possible mitigation measures to reduce their bycatch in tuna longline fisheries. Ten porbeagle sharks were tracked in waters around New Zealand for 72–300 days (median 221 days). Sharks made horizontal movements of hundreds to thousands of kilometres, with a maximum estimated track length of almost 10,000 km. Mature females made seasonal latitudinal migrations from ~46–48°S in summer to ~35–38°S during winter–spring, where they are hypothesised to give birth to pups. Porbeagle sharks exhibited diel vertical migration, diving deeper during the day than at night. Dives generally began at dawn and finished at dusk and lasted 11–15 h depending on day length. Porbeagles feed mainly on mesopelagic fish and squid and appear to forage in the vertically migrating deep scattering layer. All sharks dived to at least 600 m with a maximum recorded depth of 1024 m. During the day, most of their time was spent at depths of 200–600 m in the open ocean. Porbeagle shark bycatch could be substantially reduced by limiting longline fishing to daylight hours when they are too deep to be caught. However, longliners currently set mainly at night to avoid seabird bycatch, which would increase unless other mitigation measures were implemented to protect them. A review of factors affecting the bycatch of various species, and the impact of mitigation measures on catches of target species, is required to identify an appropriate suite of management measures.

AB  - Mobulid rays are protected in New Zealand, but the spinetail devilray Mobula japanica is caught as bycatch in skipjack tuna purse seine fisheries. Between 2005 and 2014, rays were recorded in 8.2% of observed purse seine sets. Rays were caught during summer, with a ‘hotspot’ (24.3% of sets) near the shelf edge off North Island over seabed depths of 150–350 m. Rays were usually brailed aboard with the tuna catch from successful sets, but were often entangled in the bunt of the net during unsuccessful sets. Observers tagged nine rays with popup archival tags to obtain preliminary information on their post‐release survival, and spatial and vertical movements. Seven of the nine tags reported data, and four of those rays died within 2–4 days of release. All four rays that died had been brought aboard entangled in the bunt. The three surviving rays were all brailed aboard with the tuna catch. One surviving ray remained near New Zealand for 2.7 months during summer, and the other two migrated 1400–1800 km northward to tropical waters near Vanuatu and Fiji at minimum speeds of 47 and 63 km day−1 at the end of summer. Archive data from one ray showed that it made regular vertical movements of 25–100 m amplitude, but spent most of its time shallower than 50 m, more so during the night (89.6%) than the day (76.6%), and mainly experienced temperatures of 18−22 °C. Dives deeper than 200 m were usually made during the day or twilight. All three surviving rays typically moved between the surface and 200–300 m daily, and reached greatest depths of 649 m, 1000 m and 1112 m, respectively, substantially exceeding the previous depth record for this species of 445 m. Recommendations are made for reducing purse seine mortality of mobulid rays by avoiding areas of high ray abundance, avoiding setting on ray‐associated tuna schools, and adopting best‐practice methods of returning rays to the sea from the net or vessel.

AB  - Substantial global population declines in pelagic sharks have led to the introduction of management and conservation measures, including gear restrictions and no‐retention policies, to curb declines and encourage stock recovery. As the rate of discarding sharks increases, there is a growing need to understand prognostic factors that influence their post‐release survival (PRS) outcomes. PRS was measured with survival pop‐up satellite archival tags attached to shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) released or discarded from pelagic tuna longline fishing vessels operating in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Convention Area. In total, 117 tags were deployed on 60 mako and 57 silky sharks captured as bycatch during commercial pelagic longline fishing trips in New Zealand (n = 35), Fiji (n = 58), New Caledonia (n = 10) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (n = 14). Mako engaged in long‐distance movements between New Zealand, Australia, Fiji and New Caledonia, while silky sharks tagged in the Marshall Islands showed evidence of seasonal movements eastward. PRS was determined for 110 sharks (57 mako, 53 silky sharks). Most tagged sharks of both species were uninjured (89%) at capture and most sharks (88%) survived post‐release until tag loss or the programmed pop‐up date (60 days). However, when considering a complete fishing interaction (haulback, handling, release), PRS estimates were markedly reduced to 48.6% and 52.3% for mako and silky sharks, respectively. For both species, survivorship was greater in large (>150 cm fork length) uninjured sharks and sharks released with low shark length to trailing branchline ratios. While these findings suggest that retention bans offer sharks an increased chance of survival, continued efforts should be made to improve handling and release practices, reduce trailing gear and minimize pelagic shark bycatch.

AB  - The identification and mitigation of adverse effects of the bycatch of tuna longline fishery have been mainly developed and implemented for seabirds, sharks and turtles and, the knowledge on teleost bycatch for this fishery, remains very poor. This paper contributes to a comprehensive assessment of life history traits and fishery attributes of target and bycatch species caught by the tuna longline fishery in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Data was compiled on seven life history traits and three fishery attributes for 33 and 27 teleost stocks caught by longliners in South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively. In addition, each species was assigned into four categories describing the fate of the catch: target species for commercial use, bycatch species kept for consumption, bycatch species kept for commercial use and discarded bycatch. Life history traits and fishery attributes did not differ between oceans. However, non-target but commercialized species were smaller in the Atlantic Ocean. Teleosts caught by the tuna longline fishery was segregated into three main groups: (1) the fast growing species represented mainly by dolphinfishes (Coryphaena hippurus and C. equisellis), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), snoek (Thyrsites atun) and blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus); (2) target tunas and most other bycatch species which were part of an intermediate group and (3) billfishes including swordfish representing the large and slow growing species with moderate to high market values and unknown or highly uncertain stock status. Investment in some key life history traits (such as growth coefficient) and the development of quantitative or semi-quantitative approaches (stock assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment) should be priorized as precautionary management measures for these species.

AB  - Torpediniformes (electric rays) is a relatively diverse group of benthic coastal elasmobranchs found in all shallow tropical to temperate waters around the world. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, the inter‐relationships within this lineage of cartilaginous fishes and its phylogenetic position within Batoidea remain controversial. In this study, we report the first complete sequences of two tropical electric rays, Narcine bancroftii and Narcine brasiliensis, using a combination of 454 and Sanger sequencing technologies. These species are a common bycatch of artisanal fishery communities on the north‐east Caribbean coast of Colombia and are considered Critically Endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature classification system. Overall, the two newly sequenced mitogenomes exhibit similarities in size, transcriptional orientation, gene order, and nucleotide composition in comparison to other batoids. Based on the concatenated alignment of protein‐coding genes, our phylogenetic analyses support the hypothesis that electric rays are closely related to thornback rays (Platyrhinidae), forming a clade in a sister position to a group containing the remaining three batoid orders. Within Torpediniformes, our results reject the nonmonophyletic hypothesis of the genus Narcine reported in previous morphological and molecular studies.

AB  - "Living marine resources obviously contribute to the survival of humanity. Unfortunately, numerous studies highlighted that marine biological diversity faces various threats related to overfishing and illegal fishing, pollution (marine and terrestrial), invasive species, marine litter and climate change. In this context, the incidental catch of vulnerable species (i.e., elasmobranchs, marine mammals, seabirds) is considered one of the main threats to good environmental condition of the marine fauna.The aim of the study conducted in 2020, was to highlight the impact of fishing activities on aquatic resources, especially on vulnerable fish species as picked dogfish Squalus acanthias), thornback ray (Raja clavata) and common stingray (Dasyatis pastinaca), marine mammals and seabirds. The background information was collected by observations from scientific trawl surveys by pelagic and demersal trawl gears, observations from stationary fishing points, observations from commercial beam-trawl fishing operations. The analysis of logbooks of several economic operators and data collected by observers on board vessels, highlighted the low bycatch rate for vulnerable species in most fishing gear.

AB  - Bycatch (the unintentional catch of non-target species or sizes) is consistently ranked as one of the greatest threats to marine fish populations; yet species-specific rates of bycatch survival are rarely considered in risk assessments. Regulations often require that bycatch of threatened species be released; but, if animals are already dead, their release serves no conservation purpose. We examined the survival of 12 shark species caught as bycatch in the US Atlantic pelagic longline fishery. Shark survival was evaluated in relation to fishery target (swordfish versus tuna) and four operational, environmental, and biological variables to evaluate the underlying mechanisms affecting mortality. Survival estimates ranged from 33% (night shark) to 97% (tiger shark) with seven of the 12 species being significantly affected by at least one variable. We placed our survival results within a framework that assessed each species’ relative vulnerability by integrating survival estimates with reproductive potential and found that the bigeye thresher, dusky, night, and scalloped hammerhead shark exhibited the highest vulnerabilities to bycatch. We suggest that considering ecological and biological traits of species shows promise for designing effective conservation measures, whereas techniques that reduce fisheries interactions in the first place may be the best strategy for highly vulnerable species.

AB  - We report results from the first detailed investigation of elasmobranch bycatch that contains data on species, sex, and length-frequency distributions of animals collected in the coastal south-eastern and entrance region of the Gulf of California. Using data from fishery-independent prawn trawl surveys between 2011–17, we found differences between years and zones in the number of species per tow in summer when more samples were taken, but we did not find differences in autumn and winter. We present size-frequency distributions with size at first maturity for Urobatis halleri, Urotrygon chilensis, Rhinoptera steindachneri, Hypanus dipterurus, Gymnura marmorata, and Pseudobatos glaucostigmus, which were the species most frequently present in the prawn trawls during the surveys. These distributions are presented by zone, depth stratum, and season (mainly summer, when commercial prawn trawling is prohibited, and thus information from commercial catches is not available). We found significant differences in the mean size between mature females and mature males for five of these six species. We also found that fish escape devices installed in the prawn nets early in 2016 improved the escape of mid-sized rays, demonstrating size selectivity of the fishery and suggesting the potential to improve further the escape of large-sized rays by modifying fish escape devices. Furthermore, the large number of rays caught (21 species) compared with the number of sharks caught (four species) suggests much lower catchabilities for sharks than for rays in demersal prawn trawl gear.

AB  - Juvenile white sharks distribute in coastal nursery areas, which are essential for population growth. Bahía Sebastián Vizcaíno (BSV), Mexico, is a white shark nursery area in the north‐eastern Pacific. Despite existing regulations forbidding the capture of white sharks, incidental catches still occur in some areas. Artisanal fisheries constitute one of the most important economic activities in BSV, yet no formal description of either these fisheries or the incidental catch of juvenile white sharks exists due to the poor data reporting system, thus preventing a clear understanding of the implications of these catches for the white shark population of the north‐eastern Pacific. Artisanal fishing activities and their interactions with juvenile white sharks in BSV are described based on fishermen's knowledge. Artisanal fisheries in BSV are multi‐specific, targeting mostly bottom‐related species (e.g. white seabass and California halibut) that are also common prey for juvenile white sharks. These activities are the only source of income for the majority of fishermen in BSV and are conducted throughout the year, with gillnets being the main fishing gear. White sharks are incidentally caught in bottom gillnets mainly during the summer, although another peak in incidental catch was recorded during winter, possibly related to the presence of juvenile white sharks from California, USA. The most common size of juvenile white sharks incidentally caught was <2 m in the nearshore areas close to the mouth of the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon; larger juveniles (~3 m) were caught in areas near Cedros, Natividad, and San Benito Islands. The multi‐specific nature of BSV artisanal fisheries and their socio‐economic value, and the high post‐release survival of juvenile white sharks suggest that future regulatory actions should focus on the release of incidentally caught live juvenile white sharks and the involvement of the BSV fishing community to increase the effectiveness of management efforts.

AB  - Fisheries stock assessments rely heavily on historical catch information to understand how a stock responds to exploitation and make meaningful forecasts under alternative management and environmental scenarios. However, for many bycatch species historical removals are virtually unknown, as a large portion of the catch was discarded at sea. For example, historical discard of elasmobranch species such as skates and sharks have been reported as 95 percent of the total catch based on available data. The longnose skate is one the most abundant groundfishes on the continental slope of the U.S. Pacific Coast by biomass, and the most abundant skate species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We developed a method to estimate catch of longnose skate on the U.S. West Coast based on the catch of Dover sole, a co-occurring targeted species with which longnose skate is caught. This method allowed us to reconstruct historical longnose skate catches back to the beginning of the bottom trawl fisheries and improve stock assessment for this species. We also examined the impact of using our method versus other common methods of catch reconstruction to inform stock assessment models, and found that the target-based predictive method produced results that more accurately reflected the life history and typical stock dynamics of elasmobranch taxa. Our method is not limited to the specific case of longnose skate and could be easily adapted for other species and areas.

AB  - Fisheries can profoundly affect bycatch species with ‘slow’ life history traits. Managing bait type offers one tool to control species selectivity. Different species and sizes of marine predators have different prey, and hence bait, preferences. This preference is a function of a bait’s chemical, visual, acoustic and textural characteristics and size, and for seabirds the effect on hook sink rate is also important. We conducted a global meta-analysis of existing estimates of the relative risk of capture on different pelagic longline baits. We applied a Bayesian random effects meta-analytic regression modelling approach to estimate overall expected bait-specific catch rates. For blue shark and marine turtles, there were 34% (95% HDI: 4–59%) and 60% (95% HDI: 44–76%) significantly lower relative risks of capture on forage fish bait than squid bait, respectively. Overall estimates of bait-specific relative risk were not significantly different for seven other assessed taxa. The lack of a significant overall estimate of relative capture risk for pelagic shark species combined but significant effect for blue sharks suggests there is species-specific variability in bait-specific catch risk within this group. A qualitative literature review suggests that tunas and istiophorid billfishes may have higher catch rates on squid than fish bait, which conflicts with reducing marine turtle and blue shark catch rates. The findings from this synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence support identifying economically viable bycatch management measures with acceptable tradeoffs when multispecies conflicts are unavoidable, and highlight research priorities for global pelagic longline fisheries.

AB  - Apex and mesopredators such as elasmobranchs are important for maintaining ocean health and are the focus of conservation efforts to mitigate exposure to fishing and other anthropogenic hazards. Quantifying fishing mortality components such as at-vessel mortality (AVM) is necessary for effective bycatch management. We assembled a database for 61 elasmobranch species and conducted a global meta-synthesis to estimate pelagic longline AVM rates. Evolutionary history was a significant predictor of AVM, accounting for up to 13% of variance in Bayesian phylogenetic meta-regression models for Lamniformes and Carcharhiniformes clades. Phylogenetically related species may have a high degree of shared traits that explain AVM. Model-estimated posterior mean AVM rates ranged from 5% (95% HDI 0.1%–16%) for pelagic stingrays and 76% (95% HDI 49%–90%) for salmon sharks. Measures that reduce catch, and hence AVM levels, such as input controls, bycatch quotas and gear technology to increase selectivity are appropriate for species with higher AVM rates. In addition to reducing catchability, handling-and-release practices and interventions such as retention bans in shark sanctuaries and bans on shark finning and trade hold promise for species with lower AVM rates. Robust, and where applicable, phylogenetically-adjusted elasmobranch AVM rates are essential for evidence-informed bycatch policy.

AB  - Pelagic longline fisheries affect both market and vulnerable bycatch species and can have broad effects on community structure and processes. Observer data from the Palau longline fishery were analysed to identify opportunities to mitigate vulnerable species bycatch, determine temporal trends in local abundance, and assess changes following a ban on shark retention and wire leaders. Catch and haulback condition data for bigeye and yellowfin tunas, blue and silky sharks and pelagic stingrays were fitted to standardized catch and survival rate models. The fishery caught silky and blue sharks, olive ridley sea turtles and other species of conservation concern. Changing from shallow sets to deep daytime sets might reduce shark and sea turtle catch rates but increase turtle haulback mortality rates, maintain economically viable tuna catch rates, but increase catch rates of pelagic stingrays, a lower conservation concern than main caught species of sharks and turtles. Focusing fishing effort during the middle of the calendar year would maximize yellowfin tuna and minimize silky shark standardized catch rates, but maximize blue shark catch rates. A large decline in shark fishing mortality rate very likely occurred following a ban on shark retention and wire leaders. This was due to large reductions in the nominal shark catch rate and shark retention, partially offset by decreases in the shark haulback survival rate and pre‐catch survival rate. Significantly higher blue shark and lower pelagic stingray nominal catch rates occurred on wire vs. monofilament leaders. Significantly higher blue shark and lower yellowfin tuna nominal catch rates occurred on sets using shallow ‘shark lines’. It is a research priority to compare the probability of shark pre‐catch survival after escaping from monofilament leaders with an ingested hook and trailing line to the survival probability when captured on wire leaders.

AB  - Pelagic fisheries can have profound effects on ecosystem structure and functioning, affecting ecosystem services, including fisheries production, and threaten vulnerable bycatch species. Controlling hook size could manage the species- and size-selectivity and survival of target and incidental catch. To test this hypothesis, we conducted experimental pelagic longline fishing in the western tropical Pacific testing a control hook and two hooks with wider minimum widths. Data such as catch, length and condition were fit to response-specific Bayesian geo-additive generalized additive and linear mixed regression models. Model fits were assessed using posterior predictive check tests. Catch rates of both retained and discarded species were significantly higher on medium hooks. Target tuna species were significantly larger and had significantly higher at-vessel survival rates on wider hooks. Significantly larger billfishes, also market species, were caught on narrowest hooks. These effects of hook width on length and survival, however, are a much smaller determinant of economic value of the catch than effects on catch rates. If input controls are limiting, then, relative to medium hooks, continued use of narrowest hooks would maintain current economic viability without causing a significant increase in discard catch levels, including of vulnerable sharks. If market species output controls are limiting, because the ratio of retained to discarded catch on medium hooks was greater than on narrowest hooks, medium hooks would generate lower discard levels. Further research assessing single-factor effects of longline hook width is needed to support robust meta-analyses that account for fishery-specific effects.

AB  - Declines in absolute abundance and altered size distributions from size‐selective removals of market species of pelagic apex predators in tuna fisheries alters evolutionary characteristics of populations and ecosystem processes and stability. Pelagic fishing at seamounts, where hyperstability of pelagic predators may occur, can exacerbate declining abundance and have high bycatch of species groups that are highly vulnerable to overexploitation. Generalized additive mixed Poisson regression models (GAMMs) were fitted to Hawaii longline tuna fishery observer data to determine temporal trends in standardized catch rates, an index for local, relative abundance. Temporal trends in expectile length distributions were determined through geoadditive expectile GAMMs. Significant declining trends in relative abundance in this fishery were observed for tunas, sharks and billfish. A decline in seabird standardized catch rate occurred concurrently with the uptake of seabird bycatch mitigation technology. Changed spatial distribution of fishing effort and increased use of wider circle hooks likely contributed to a declining sea turtle standardized catch rate. Tuna and billfish mean lengths significantly increased over the time series due to entire distributions of length classes having shifted towards larger fish. Larger tunas comprised a larger proportion of the catch due to fewer small tunas being caught, and to a lesser extent because mean lengths of larger size classes increased. Conversely, billfish largest length classes experienced the largest increases in average lengths. Changes in spatial and seasonal distributions of fishing effort, increased use of wider circle hooks, and possibly increasing purse seine selective removals of juvenile tunas, may have contributed to increased selectivity for larger fish. Significant differences in standardized catch rates and length distributions at a shallow seamount vs. the open ocean confirms the aggregating effect of seamounts on pelagic predators, including juvenile market species of pelagic fish and species groups relatively vulnerable to overexploitation. Wider circle hooks significantly improved valuable tuna standardized catch rates, but also increased unwanted shark and reduced valuable billfish standardized catch rates.

Because no single approach is optimal across taxonomic groups, a multi-model ensemble of relative risk estimates for a data-poor Pacific Ocean tuna longline fishery was obtained from two semi-quantitative Productivity-Susceptibility Analyses (PSAs) and from a quantitative approach that estimates instantaneous fishing mortality to compare to reference points of yield-per-recruit models. Individual estimates were combined to produce a pooled mean relative risk rank order. The study identified stocks below biological limits for which the contribution from this fishery to cumulative anthropogenic mortality may warrant intervention. Relative risks in descending order were for populations of albatrosses, cetaceans, mesopelagic sharks, rays, marine turtles, epipelagic sharks and teleosts. The fishery’s contribution to cumulative fishing mortality of western central north Pacific Ocean striped marlin warrants a more rigorous assessment to determine absolute risks. The study identified the disparate factors explaining relative risk from an individual fishery versus absolute risk from cumulative anthropogenic mortality sources. Improved risk assessments are possible by addressing identified deficits with PSAs, obtaining information on variables that explain catch and post-capture survival risks that was unavailable for this assessment, improving electronic monitoring data quality and filling gaps in life history traits. Findings support stakeholders to design integrated bycatch management frameworks that mitigate fishing mortality of the most vulnerable taxa and account for multispecies conflicts that result from some bycatch mitigation methods.

AB  - Elasmobranch mortality in pelagic longline fisheries poses a risk to some populations, alters the distribution of abundance between sympatric competitors, changing ecosystem structure, processes and stability. Individual and synergistic effects on elasmobranch catch and survival from pelagic longline gear factors, including methods prescribed to mitigate bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, were determined. Overall relative risk of higher circle vs. J‐shaped hook shark catch rates conditioned on potentially informative moderators, from 30 studies, was estimated using an inverse‐precision weighted mixed‐effects meta‐regression modelling approach. Sharks had a 1.20 times (95% CI: 1.03–1.39) significantly higher pooled relative risk of capture on circle hooks, with two significant moderators. The pooled relative risk estimate of ray circle hook catch from 15 studies was not significant (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.89–1.66) with no significant moderators. From a literature review, wire leaders had higher shark catch and haulback mortality than monofilament. Interacting effects of hook, bait and leader affect shark catch rates: hook shape and width and bait type determine hooking position and ability to sever monofilament leaders. Circle hooks increased elasmobranch catch, but reduced haulback mortality and deep hooking relative to J‐shaped hooks of the same or narrower width. Using fish vs. squid for bait increased shark catch and deep hooking. Pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) catch and mortality were lower on wider hooks. Using circle instead of J‐shaped hooks and fish instead of squid for bait, while benefitting sea turtles, odontocetes and possibly seabirds, exacerbates elasmobranch catch and injury, therefore warranting fishery‐specific assessments to determine relative risks.

AB  - The reduction of sea turtle mortality in fisheries may contribute to recovering populations. To reduce turtle interactions, regulations for the Hawaii-based longline swordfish fishery required vessels to switch from using a J-shaped hook with squid bait to a wider circle-shaped hook with fish bait. Analyses of observer data showed that, following the introduction of the regulations, significant and large reductions in sea turtle and shark capture rates occurred without compromising target species catches. Capture rates of leatherback and loggerhead turtles significantly declined by 83% and 90%, respectively. The swordfish catch rate significantly increased by 16%. However, combined tuna species and combined mahimahi, opah, and wahoo catch rates significantly declined by 50% and 34%, respectively. The shark catch rate significantly declined by 36%, highlighting the potential for the use of fish instead of squid for bait to contribute to addressing concerns over the sustainability of current levels of shark exploitation. There was also a highly significant reduction in the proportion of turtles that swallowed hooks (versus being hooked in the mouth or body or entangled) and a highly significant increase in the proportion of caught turtles that were released after removal of all terminal tackle, which may increase the likelihood of turtles surviving the interaction. A quarter of turtle captures were in clusters (>1 turtle caught per set and consecutive sets with turtle captures), which is substantially higher than predicted by chance if the events were independent. This suggests that turtles aggregate at foraging grounds and that instituting methods to avoid real-time turtle bycatch hotspots may further reduce turtle interactions. There was no significant correlation between turtle and swordfish catch rates (vessels with high swordfish CPUE do not necessarily have high turtle CPUE), indicating that there may be a fishing practice or gear design causing some vessels to have low turtle catch rates without compromising swordfish catch rates.

AB  - To support implementing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, ecological risk assessment (ERA) methods have recently been developed for the continuum of data-deficient to data-rich fisheries. A semi-quantitative ERA was conducted for the Marshall Islands longline bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) fishery. The study used information from analyses of observer data, surveys of captains and crew and inventories of gear and equipment. Relative risks were evaluated through a consideration of phylogenetic uniqueness, risk of population extirpation, risk of species extinction and importance in ecosystem regulation. The fishery presents a highest relative risk to leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), green (Chelonia mydas) and olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtle Regional Management Units that overlap with the fishery, in that order. The next highest relative risk is to affected stocks of oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), blue (Prionace glauca), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks, in that sequence. Seabird bycatch is likely not problematic. There was inadequate information to assess risks to cetacean populations. Risks to stocks of market and non-market species of marine fishes with r-selected life history characteristics were not assessed. This is because estimates of critical threshold levels of local and absolute abundance and current biomass are not known for many of these stocks. Several best practice gear technology methods to mitigate problematic catch of vulnerable species groups are currently employed: monofilament leaders, whole fish for bait, single-hooking fish bait, no lightsticks, and no fishing at shallow submerged features. Setting terminal tackle below 100m and carrying and using best practice handling and release equipment were methods identified to reduce fishing mortality and injury of vulnerable species. More information is needed to determine if weaker hooks should be prescribed to mitigate cetacean bycatch. The large benefit to sea turtles of replacing remaining J-shaped hooks with circle hooks might outweigh a possible small increase in elasmobranch catch rates. The consumption of 2024l of fuel per tonne of landed catch, which is within the range of available estimated rates from similar fisheries, could be reduced, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, through more frequent maintenance and upgrading vessel equipment and materials. Observer data quality may be adequate to support a quantitative Level 3 ERA to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on standardized catch rates and to estimate population-level effects from fishing mortality.

AB  - Overexploitation of bycatch and target species in marine capture fisheries is the most widespread and direct driver of change and loss of global marine biodiversity. Bycatch in purse seine and pelagic longline tuna fisheries, the two primary gear types for catching tunas, is a primary mortality source of some populations of seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals and sharks. Bycatch of juvenile tunas and unmarketable species and sizes of other fish in purse seine fisheries, and juvenile swordfish in longline fisheries, contributes to the overexploitation of some stocks, and is an allocation issue. There has been substantial progress in identifying gear technology solutions to seabird and sea turtle bycatch on longlines and to direct dolphin mortality in purse seines. Given sufficient investment, gear technology solutions are probably feasible for the remaining bycatch problems. More comprehensive consideration across species groups is needed to identify conflicts as well as mutual benefits from mitigation methods. Fishery-specific bycatch assessments are necessary to determine the efficacy, economic viability, practicality and safety of alternative mitigation methods. While support for gear technology research and development has generally been strong, political will to achieve broad uptake of best practices has been lacking. The five Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have achieved mixed progress mitigating bycatch. Large gaps remain in both knowledge of ecological risks and governance of bycatch. Most binding conservation and management measures fall short of gear technology best practice. A lack of performance standards, in combination with an inadequate observer coverage for all but large Pacific purse seiners, and incomplete data collection, hinders assessing measures' efficacy. Compliance is probably low due to inadequate surveillance and enforcement. Illegal, unreported and unregulated tuna fishing hampers governance efforts. Replacing consensus-based decision-making and eliminating opt-out provisions would help. Instituting rights-based management measures could elicit improved bycatch mitigation practices. While gradual improvements in an international governance of bycatch can be expected, market-based mechanisms, including retailers and their suppliers working with fisheries to gradually improve practices and governance, promise to be expeditious and effective.

AB  - Limited information is available on artisanal and subsistence shark fisheries across the Pacific. The aim of this study was to investigate Fiji’s inshore fisheries which catch sharks. In January and February 2013, 253 semi-directive interviews were conducted in 117 villages and at local harbours on Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Ovalau and a number of islands of the Mamanuca and Yasawa archipelagos. Of the 253 interviewees, 81.4% reported to presently catch sharks and 17.4% declared that they did not presently catch any sharks. Of the 206 fishers that reported to catch sharks, 18.4% targeted sharks and 81.6% caught sharks as bycatch. When targeted, primary use of sharks was for consumption or for sale. Sharks caught as bycatch were frequently released (69.6%), consumed (64.9%) or shared amongst the community (26.8%). Fishers’ identification based on an identification poster and DNA barcoding revealed that at least 12 species of elasmobranchs, 11 shark and one ray species (Rhynchobatus australiae) were caught. This study, which is the first focused exploration of the shark catch in Fiji’s inshore fisheries, suggests that the country’s artisanal shark fisheries are small but have the potential to develop into larger and possibly more targeted fisheries.

AB  - The catch of non-target animal species, known as bycatch, and their discard are main problems in fisheries management. The prawn or shrimp trawl fisheries in particular are recognized for their incidence in the global discards. In Argentine Patagonia there is an industrial shrimp fishery based on the species Pleoticus muelleri, of high commercial value. Since 2001 an on-board observer program collects information about all species caught. We analyzed the composition of the bycatch of fishes in the Patagonian shrimp fishery and the frequency of species occurrence. The data analyzed correspond to the outrigger freezing fleet, which catches more than 75% of the total shrimp landings in Argentina. We identified 67 species of osteichthyes, chondrichthyes and myxini, corresponding to 42 families. The families with the larger number of species were Rajidae (9), Clupeidae (3), Ophidiidae (3), Zoarcidae (3), Nototheniidae (3) y Paralichthyidae (3). Of the 67 species reported as bycatch, seven had not been reported before in the San Jorge gulf and adjacent waters: Atlantoraja cyclophora, Brevoortia aurea, Diplodus argenteus, Pagrus pagrus, Micropogonias furnieri, Sarda sarda and Paralichthys patagonicus. La captura de especies animales no objetivo y su posterior descarte al mar son problemas centrales en el manejo pesquero. Las pesqueras de langostino y camarn, en particular, son reconocidas por su alta incidencia en el descarte mundial. En aguas de la Patagonia argentina se desarrolla una pesquera industrial de langostino sustentada por la especie Pleoticus muelleri, de alto valor econmico. Desde el ao 2001 un programa de observadores a bordo recolecta informacin no slo de la especie objetivo de la pesquera sino de todas las especies capturadas. En este trabajo analizamos la composicin y frecuencia de ocurrencia de la ictiofauna capturada incidentalmente en la pesquera del langostino patagnico. Los datos analizados corresponden a la flota congeladora arrastrera que opera con dos redes langostineras, una por banda, llamada flota congeladora tangonera, la que captura ms del 75% de los desembarcos de langostino en Argentina. Se identificaron 67 taxones de peces seos, cartilaginoso y mixines, correspondientes a 42 familias. Las familias con mayor nmero de especies presentes fueron Rajidae (9), Clupeidae (3), Ophidiidae (3), Zoarcidae (3), Nototheniidae (3) y Paralichthyidae (3). De los 67 taxones registrados, siete de ellos no estaban citados para el golfo San Jorge y aguas adyacentes: Atlantoraja cyclophora, Brevoortia aurea, Diplodus argenteus, Pagrus pagrus, Micropogonias furnieri, Sarda sarda y Paralichthys patagonicus.

AB  - Circle hooks have gained recent attention as a cost-effective bycatch mitigation tool in pelagic longline fisheries, particularly for marine turtles. Over the last few years, a growing number of studies have investigated the use of circle hooks and their effects on other species, including elasmobranchs. To elucidate the potential value of circle hook use as a tool for shark conservation and management in pelagic longline fisheries, we conducted a quantitative review of all available studies to date. We compiled 15 published and eight gray literature studies and where possible used random effects meta-analysis and analysis of covariance to test the effects of circle hooks on catchability and at-vessel mortality rates. Overall, results suggest that using circle hooks on pelagic longlines do not have a major effect on shark catch rates, but do reduce at-vessel mortality compared to J-hooks. Thus circle hooks should be seen as one potential tool to help reduce bycatch mortality of sharks in longline fisheries. However, the high level of heterogeneity found between studies highlights the need for shark-specific controlled experiments to provide more definitive results.

AB  - The indiscriminate capture of non-target organisms (bycatch) in commercial fisheries undermines the sustainable development of marine resources. In the Northwest Atlantic, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) account for most of the bycatch in the Canadian pelagic longline swordfish fishery. Minimizing the capture of this species is of interest to conservationists as well as the fishing industry because the high incidence of shark bycatch negatively affects fishing operations through bait loss and increased handling time. Electropositive metals (e.g., lanthanide) oxidize in seawater and create electric fields, which can alter the swimming and feeding behaviors of several species of sharks. Although electropositive metals appear to have the potential to reduce shark bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, there have not been any controlled trials reported from a commercial fishery. A total of 7 sets (6300 hooks) with 3 hook treatments (standard hooks, hooks with electropositive metals (neodymium/praseodymium), and hooks with lead weights) were deployed in 2011 on the Scotian Shelf in the Northwest Atlantic. The results of this study show that electropositive metals did not reduce the catch of blue sharks or other common shark bycatch species, and hence do not present a practical bycatch mitigation measure for the Canadian longline fishery.

AB  - Globally, the bycatch of marine mammals in fisheries represents the greatest source of human-caused mortality that threatens the sustainability of many populations and species. The Australian sea lion ( Neophoca cinerea ) is an endangered species, whose populations off South Australia (SA) have been subject to bycatch in a demersal gillnet fishery targeting sharks since the 1960s. A comprehensive assessment was undertaken of sea lion bycatch mortality that combined independent fishery observer data with species distribution models (underpinned by satellite tracking, abundance data and population modeling) to model the relationship between at-sea foraging effort and bycatch rate. Combined with the distribution of fishing effort, these models enabled the overall level of bycatch mortality to be estimated by age, sex and subpopulation, facilitating population viability analyses that indicated most subpopulations were declining, and subject to unsustainable levels of bycatch mortality. To reduce this mortality, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority implemented an Australian Sea Lion Management Strategy that included an independent observer program (ultimately 100% electronic monitoring of gillnet fishing off SA), permanent spatial gillnet closures around all sea lion breeding sites, bycatch mortality limits that triggered temporal (18 months) spatial closures when zone-specific bycatch trigger limits were reached, and incentives for gillnet fishers to switch to an alternate fishing method (longlines). The Strategy had immediate impacts on the fishery: it resulted in significant reductions in gillnet fishing effort and on the reported bycatch of sea lions. In the next decade, there was an estimated 98% reduction in sea lion bycatch mortality from gillnet interactions and an apparent stabilization of the decline in sea lion pup abundances at some impacted breeding sites. There was an almost complete transition in the fishery from gillnets to longlines, and fishing catches returned to pre-management levels. The successful implementation of management measures to mitigate sea lion bycatch mortality in the gillnet fishery off SA was rapid, science informed, adaptive, comprehensive, and backed by strong compliance and monitoring of the fishery. It provides an important case study which demonstrates how management measures can be effectively applied to mitigate bycatch mortality of marine mammals and other marine protected species.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is one of the biggest threats to seabird populations. Managers need to identify where and when bycatch occurs and ensure effective action. In 1999, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-s) encouraging states to voluntarily assess potential seabird bycatch problems and implement a National Plan of Action (NPOA) if needed. However, the IPOA-s is ambiguous about the steps and objectives, diminishing its value as a conservation tool. We reviewed NPOAs to identify approaches taken to determine whether seabird bycatch is problematic, how bycatch minimisation and population objectives are set, and if thresholds are specified for managing impacts. Our aim was to recommend measures for improving consistency and effectiveness in future NPOAs and other management frameworks for seabirds, with relevance for other threatened marine vertebrates including sharks, turtles, pinnipeds and cetaceans. Globally, 16 NPOAs have been published, but few effectively linked seabird bycatch risk, objectives and management. However, we identified the following best-practice elements that could improve NPOA design: (1) defining explicit risk criteria and methods to assess bycatch problems; (2) setting specific and measurable objectives for minimising bycatch and achieving desired population status; and (3) defining fishery-specific thresholds to trigger management action linked to the population objective. Consistent adoption of NPOA best practice, particularly in states that have not already developed an NPOA, would help to mitigate bycatch threats and ensure fisheries do not reduce the viability of seabird populations.

AB  - The deep sea is often thought of as a cold, dark and uniform environment with a low-fish biomass, much of which is highly adapted for life in a food-poor environment. While this might be true of the pelagic fish living in the water column, it is certainly not true of the demersal fish which live on or close to the bottom on the continental slopes around the British Isles (the Atlantic Frontier). These fish are currently being commercially exploited. There is growing evidence to support the view that success of the demersal fish assemblages depends on the pelagic or benthopelagic food sources that impinge both vertically and horizontally onto the slope.There are several quite separate and distinct deep-water fisheries on the Atlantic Frontier. It is a physical barrier, the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, which results in the most significant division of the fisheries. The Ridge, which has a minimum depth of about 500m, separates the warmer deep Atlantic waters from the much colder Norwegian Sea water and as a result, the deep-water fisheries to the west of the Hebrides and around the offshore banks are quite different from those of the Faroe-Shetland Channel (West of Shetland).The fisheries to the West of the Hebrides can be further divided by the fishing method used into bottom trawl, semipelagic trawl and longline. The bottom-trawl fisheries extend from the shelf-slope break down to about 1700m and the target species varies with depth. The smallest vessels in the fleet fish on the upper slope, where an important target species is the anglerfish or monkfish (Lophius spp.). On the mid-slope the main target species are blue ling (Molva dypterygia) and roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), with bycatches of black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and deep-water sharks. On the lower slope orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) is an important target species. The major semipelagic trawl fishery is a seasonal fishery on spawning aggregations of blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). The other semipelagic fishery is on spawning aggregations of the greater silver smelt or argentine (Argentina silus). Spanish and UK vessels that target mainly hake (Merluccius merluccius) and a Norwegian fleet that targets ling (Molva molva), blue ling and tusk (Brosme brosme) dominate the upper slope longline fishery. West of Shetland, the fishery on the upper slope has some similarities with that of the Hebridean slope, with anglerfish and blue ling being important target species. A quite different fishery occurs in the transition zone between the Atlantic and Norwegian Sea waters. Here the main target species is Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Below the transition zone biomass decreases rapidly and there is no fishery.It is generally agreed that many deep-water species have slow growth, a high age at first maturity and a low fecundity, which makes them vulnerable to over-exploitation. Other features of these fishes such as high mortality of discards and escapees will add to the problems. Despite this the only management procedures in place are general limitation of effort measures within the area of jurisdiction of the European Union.

AB  - We present the outcomes of a collaborative research programme tasked with reducing bycatch, and thus discards in a temperate Australian prawn trawl fishery. Sea trials in the Gulf of St Vincent, South Australia, assessed the performance of a modified trawlnet that incorporated a rigid polyethylene grid and a T90-mesh codend. Compared with conventional designs, the modified net yielded marked reductions in bycatch (cumulatively >81% by weight), with pronounced decreases in sponge (92%), elasmobranchs (80%), teleost fish (71%), molluscs (61%), and crustaceans (78%). Using commercial logbook data, we estimate that the use of modified nets could reduce discards by ∼240 tons per year. This outcome was achieved with moderate declines in the catch rate (kg h−1) of the target species, Western King Prawn (mean ∼15%), of which almost all were small adults of low commercial value. Adoption of the modified net by industry was realized in March 2012, because it met environmental objectives (i.e. reducing bycatch and improving public perceptions of sustainability), reduced prawn damage, demonstrated commensurate financial returns, and engaged stakeholders throughout the development process. Overall, the project provides a useful example of bycatch research with demonstrable outcomes of improving the ecological and economic sustainability of prawn harvests.

AB  - Incidental catch of marine species can create ecological and economic issues, particularly for endangered species. The smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean and listed as Endangered in the US Endangered Species Act. One of its major threats is bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries. Despite the protection afforded by the US Endangered Species Act, smalltooth sawfish are still captured as bycatch in commercial fisheries. Acoustic and satellite tag data collected on 59 sawfish between 2011 and 2019 were analysed to assess commercial fishery bycatch risk for large juveniles and adults off Florida. This study focused on shrimp trawl, south‐east coastal gillnet, and shark bottom longline fisheries, as these were identified in the recovery plan as having the greatest potential threats to recovery. Bycatch risk associated with the shrimp trawl fishery was significantly higher than the other fisheries, indicating that this fishery currently poses the greatest threat to recovery. Bycatch risk was concentrated in all seasons in the Gulf of Mexico adjacent to the lower Florida Keys for the shrimp trawl fishery, off Cape Canaveral in the south‐east coastal gillnet fishery, and in the Atlantic Ocean adjacent to the Florida Keys in the shark bottom longline fishery. Tagging location and sex were predictors of bycatch risk. Individuals tagged in Charlotte Harbor had the highest shrimp trawl bycatch risk. Females tagged in south Florida tended to reside in the deepest water, which is where shrimp trawl effort is highest. Therefore, females may be at more risk in these deeper waters. Results from this study indicate a year‐round closure of waters off south‐west Florida to the shrimp trawl fishery between Charlotte Harbor and the western Florida Keys would reduce sawfish bycatch, and thus mortality, which is in line with recovery plan goals.

AB  - The National Marine Fisheries Service has encouraged regional management councils to develop fisheries ecosystem plans that, among other things, identify the bycatch species within each fishery and describe each species' spatial and temporal distribution. Horseshoe crabs Limulus polyphemus have been harvested along the eastern coast of the USA since the 1800s; however, a fishery management plan was only recently created for this species, and bycatch in the horseshoe crab trawl fishery has not been quantified. We identified species likely to be caught as bycatch in the commercial fishery by using species composition data from a fishery‐independent horseshoe crab trawl survey conducted in 2005 and 2006. Seventy‐six taxa were caught, including 47 finfish species from 33 families. Skates (family Rajidae) comprised more than one‐half of the total biomass caught, and horseshoe crabs comprised one‐third of the total biomass. Catch per unit effort (kg/km towed) was greatest for little skate Leucoraja erinacea, winter skate Leucoraja ocellata, horseshoe crab, and clearnose skate Raja eglanteria. We also caught species that are currently on the World Conservation Union's Red List (e.g., Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus) and unmanaged within U.S. waters (e.g., cownose ray Rhinoptera bonasus and smooth dogfish Mustelus canis). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to cluster sites based on species abundance. The sites strongly clustered into two distinct groups, suggesting that species composition differs between northern and southern sites. Bottom water temperature was a significant factor in determining species composition, explaining almost 70% of the variation in species composition among sites. The results of this study provide managers with a better understanding of which nontarget populations may be affected by the horseshoe crab trawl fishery, a first step in understanding the broader ecosystem‐level effects of this fishery.

AB  - The Greenland shark (<i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>) is the main bycatch species in established and exploratory inshore longline fisheries for Greenland halibut (<i>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</i>) on the east coast of Baffin Island, Canada. Bycatch and entanglement in longline gear has at times been substantial and post-release survival is questionable when Greenland sharks are released with trailing fishing gear. This study investigated the effect of the type of fishing line used in the gangion and gangion breaking strength on catch rates of Greenland shark and Greenland halibut in bottom set longlines. Circle (size 14/0, 0° offset) hooks were used throughout the study. Behavior of captured sharks, mode of capture (i.e., jaw hook and/or entanglement), level of entanglement in longline gear, time required to disentangle sharks and biological information (sex, body length and health status) were recorded. Catch rates of Greenland shark were independent of monofilament nylon gangion breaking strength and monofilament gangions captured significantly fewer Greenland sharks than the traditional braided multifilament nylon gangion. Catch rates and body size of Greenland halibut did not differ significantly between gangion treatments. Although most (84%) of the Greenland sharks were hooked by the jaw, a high percentage (76%) were entangled in the mainline. The mean length of mainline entangled around the body and/or caudal peduncle and caudal fin was 28.7 m. Greenland sharks exhibited cannibalistic behavior with 15% of captured sharks cannibalized. All remaining sharks were alive and survived the disentanglement process which can be attributed to their lethargic behavior and lack of resistance when hauled to the surface. Thus, as a conservation measure fishers should be encouraged to remove trailing fishing gear prior to release. Our results are used to demonstrate benefits to the fishing industry with regard to an overall reduction in the period of time to disentangle sharks and damage to fishing gear by switching from braided multifilament to monofilament gangions in Greenland halibut longline fisheries.

AB  - The Greenland Shark (<i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>) is the most common bycatch in the Greenland halibut (<i>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</i>) bottom longline fishery in Cumberland Sound, Canada. Historically, this inshore fishery has been prosecuted through the ice during winter but winter storms and unpredictable landfast ice conditions since the mid-1990s have led to interest in developing a summer fishery during the ice-free season. However, bycatch of Greenland shark was found to increase substantially with 570 sharks captured during an experimental Greenland halibut summer fishery (i.e., mean of 6.3 sharks per 1,000 hooks set) and mortality was reported to be about 50% due in part to fishers killing sharks that were severely entangled in longline gear. This study investigated whether the SMART (Selective Magnetic and Repellent-Treated) hook technology is a practical deterrent to Greenland shark predation and subsequent bycatch on bottom longlines. Greenland shark feeding behavior, feeding kinematics, and variables affecting entanglement/disentanglement and release are also described. The SMART hook failed to deter Greenland shark predation, i.e., all sharks were captured on SMART hooks, some with more than one SMART hook in their jaw. Moreover, recently captured Greenland sharks did not exhibit a behavioral response to SMART hooks. In situ observations of Greenland shark feeding show that this species uses a powerful inertial suction mode of feeding and was able to draw bait into the mouth from a distance of 25-35 cm. This method of feeding is suggested to negate the potential deterrent effects of electropositive metal and magnetic alloy substitutions to the SMART hook technology. The number of hooks entangled by a Greenland shark and time to disentangle and live-release a shark was found to increase with body length.

AB  - Bycatch remains one of the most significant fisheries issues in the world and its monitoring and reporting is now expected in many regions. This paper provides a global synthesis of the data that are available on one of the most controversial components of bycatch, that associated with the capture and discarding of endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species in marine commercial and artisanal fisheries. We examine the available literature regarding estimates for the key taxa in this category of bycatch (seabirds, turtles, sea snakes, marine mammals, sharks, rays and teleosts) and use the data to try to provide a total global estimate. We estimate (albeit quite imprecisely) that at least 20 million individuals of such species are discarded annually throughout the world. However, there remain far too many gaps and uncertainties across fisheries and regions in the information to provide any robustness (or variance) around such an estimate, nor to determine the actual fates of these animals (many may survive). This is exacerbated because: (1) the occurrences of such species are often rare and controversial and so go either unnoticed and/or unrecorded; (2) different levels of protection are afforded to different ETP species in different countries and fisheries and; (3) discarding practices vary greatly across a hierarchy of spatio-temporal scales and according to individual fishing conditions and procedures—the latter affecting actual mortalities. Nevertheless, there have been major initiatives established in recent years to provide better data on such interactions in addition to novel fishing methods and practices that reduce them and also improve the survival of discarded individuals. This paper discusses the data currently available and the quite significant gaps that remain.

AB  - The western and central Pacific Ocean supports the world's largest tuna fisheries. Since the 1990s, the purse‐seine fishery has increasingly fished in association with fish aggregating devices (FADs), which has increased catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tunas and vulnerable bycatch species (e.g., sharks). This has raised concerns regarding the sustainability of these species’ populations and the supporting ecosystem, but may provide improved food security of Pacific Island nations through utilisation of FAD‐associated byproduct species (e.g., wahoo). An ecosystem model of the western Pacific Warm Pool Province was used to explore the potential ecological impacts of varying FAD fishing effort (±50% or 100%) over 30 years. The ecosystem has undergone a significant change in structure since 1980 from heavy exploitation of top predators (e.g., tunas) and “fishing up the food web” of high‐trophic‐level non‐target species. The ecosystem appeared resistant to simulated fishing perturbations, with only modest changes (<10%) in the biomass of most groups, although some less productive shark bycatch species decreased by up to 43%, which had a subsequent positive effect on several byproduct species, the prey of sharks. Reduction of FAD effort by at least 50% was predicted to increase the biomass of tuna species and sharks and return the ecosystem structure to a pre‐industrial‐fishing state within 10 years. Spatial disaggregation of the model and integration of economic information are recommended to better capture ecological and economic changes that may result from fishing and/or climate impacts and to develop appropriate management measures in response.

AB  - Demonstrating ecological sustainability is a challenge for fisheries worldwide, and few methods can quantify fishing impacts on diverse, low value or rare species. The current study employed a widely used ecological risk assessment method and incorporated new data to assess the change in sustainability of species following the introduction of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in Australia’s Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). Population recovery ranks changed for 19 of the 56 elasmobranch species after the introduction of TEDs, with nine species showing an increase in sustainability. Unexpectedly, ten species showed a decrease in sustainability. This was due to TEDs successfully excluding large animals from the catch, resulting in a lower mean length at capture, which reduced the recovery ranks for two criteria relying on length data. This falsely indicates that TEDs increase the impact on pre-breeding animals, thus reducing the recovery potential of these species. The results demonstrate that existing attribute-based risk assessment methods may be inadequate for reflecting even the most obvious changes in fishing impacts on bycatch species. Industry and management can benefit greatly from an approach that more accurately estimates absolute risk. The development and requirements of a new quantitative risk assessment method to be developed for the NPF, and applicable to fisheries worldwide, are discussed.

AB  - Tuna fisheries are among the largest and most valuable fisheries in the world, but most interact with many non‐target species, including several of high conservation importance. The spinetail devil ray (Mobula mobular) – listed as ‘Endangered’ on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species – is a commonly discarded bycatch species, particularly in the eastern Pacific Ocean, yet insufficient data exist to undertake a traditional population assessment. A new ecological risk assessment approach designed for data‐limited settings – Ecological Assessment of the Sustainable Impacts of Fisheries (EASI‐Fish) – was used to reconstruct the historical vulnerability status of M. mobular and to simulate potential changes in its status under 45 hypothetical conservation and management measures. These involved various temporal closures of the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna fishery, decreasing post‐capture mortality by improved handling and release practices, and combinations of the two. The species was classified as ‘Least Vulnerable’ between 1979 and 1993, but became ‘Most Vulnerable’ from 1994, which coincided with a rapid spatial expansion of the industrial purse‐seine fishery, and especially from 2011 following the rapid increase in the number of sets made on floating objects. Simulating the conservation and management measures in place in 2018 revealed that 31 of the 45 scenarios resulted in a change in classification of the species to ‘Least Vulnerable’, which primarily involved a reduction of post‐capture mortality by as little as 20%. It is fortuitous in that education of fishers to implement appropriate best handling and release practices is simpler, more rapid and more cost‐effective than the implementation of fishery closures or gear modifications, which can be expensive and complex to implement and monitor and will probably result in substantial reduction in the catches of target species.

AB  - An economically-important Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) longline fishery operates in the Ross Sea region (RSR), in the Southern Ocean. Management of this fishery according to Article II of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources aims to minimise the risk of depletion of the species that are caught as bycatch. We employed spatio-temporal models fitted to catch rate data reported by fishing vessels between 2003 and 2020 to understand the spatio-temporal abundance patterns of the major species groups caught as bycatch in the RSR Antarctic toothfish fishery. The study region consisted of the areas of the RSR where fishing has occurred since the inception of the longline fishery. The study species groups included macrourids (Macrouridae), skates (Rajiformes), icefish (Channichthyidae), eel cods (Muraenolepididae) and morid cods (Moridae). The Akaike information criterion-selected models included the effect of bottom depth and, often, also the effect of surface chlorophyll-a concentration. We found that bottom depth explained only a very small proportion of the variance in the data, while surface chlorophyll-a concentration explained very little of the variance. The predicted long-term trends of three species groups were clear: the relative abundance of macrourids has decreased, while those of skates and icefish have increased. We resampled from the predictive distributions to identify the abundance hotspots of each of the species groups, defined as the areas where long-term log-relative abundance (i.e., mean log-relative abundance over the study period) was at or greater than the average long-term log-relative abundance over the entire study region. From these abundance hotspots for the individual species groups, we developed two alternative composite hotspot indices. Both composite hotspot indices were highest on the Ross Sea continental shelf slope, between 160°E and 175°W. Our results can be used to guide the setting of bycatch limits and inform fishing vessels about bycatch species abundance hotspots in the RSR. We also recommend that future modelling studies seek to disentangle the direct and indirect impacts of the RSR Antarctic toothfish fishery on the bycatch species which are also prey of Antarctic toothfish.

AB  - Quantifying the behavioural response of chondrichthyans to capture in longline fisheries can assist in understanding the physiological changes resulting from capture stress and ultimately aid in developing fishing practices that increase the survival of released bycatch species. Here, we evaluated the use of time-depth recorders (TDR) as a tool to quantify the amount of movement during capture across 42 animals from seven species of shark and one species of ray caught on hooks with TDRs attached in either a demersal or surface longline. Depth changes over time were analysed using three methods to estimate the percentage of time sharks and rays struggled on the line. Methods used were; 1) a Visual Assessment Method (VAM) of the TDR trace conducted by two investigators quantifying movement by summing the duration of movement bouts visually identified by erratic changes of depth; 2) the Gangion Extension Method (GEM) which quantifies movement by summing periods when captured animals altered their depth by >50% of the gangion length; and 3) the Vertical Excursion Method (VEM) which quantifies movement by summing periods when the absolute depth change between successive data points exceeded a threshold determined from the maximum depth change in the TDR data prior to capture of the animal. We found that the VAM was consistent across investigators and produced significantly higher estimates of movement than GEM and VEM. Estimates of movement from GEM and VEM were not significantly different to each other, but unlike GEM, VEM could be applied to TDRs used in both surface and demersal longlines. The amount of movement observed was different between species and such differences were consistent across all methods, indicating that species-specific behavioural responses to capture can be identified. The ability to assess capture behaviour using VEM allows inter-species comparisons, which may be used as a metric for rapid, generalised assessment of species' responses to longline capture where physiological data may be limited or lacking. Such assessments are important in the design of species-specific management for bycaught animals.

AB  - Fishery interactions pose the most significant direct anthropogenic threat to marine mammals. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of acoustic alarms at reducing the bycatch of cetaceans by small-scale gillnet vessels operating from the northern Peru port of Mancora. We equipped nets with 10 kHz pingers for vessels targeting sharks, tuna, dolphinfish, and rays. We monitored a total of 313 sets in 60 trips. We found that small cetacean bycatch per unit effort (BPUE) was reduced by 83% in experimental nets compared to control nets, with no observed reduction in whale BPUE. The study also found that pingers did not negatively affect catch rates of target species such as rays and bony fishes. However, sets with pingers had a reduction in shark catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 32.9%. Given the high number of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) entanglements we observed, we recommend testing of lower frequency “whale” pingers. We also encourage larger scale implementation of pingers for small cetaceans given the potential shown here to reduce gillnet bycatch mortality by thousands of animals annually.

AB  - The scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini and the great hammerhead S. mokarran are typically caught as bycatch in a variety of fisheries and are listed as globally Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Due to very high at-vessel mortality for these species, research is needed on fishing methods to reduce mortality for longline-captured sharks. A series of fishing experiments were conducted employing hook timers and temperature–depth recorders on contracted commercial vessels fishing with bottom-longline gear to assess factors related to mortality. A total of 273 sets were deployed with 54 485 hook timers. Scalloped and great hammerheads had at-vessel mortality rates of 62.9% and 56.0%, respectively. Median hooking times for scalloped and great hammerheads were 3.5 h and 3.4 h, respectively, and 50% mortality was predicted at 3.5 h and 3.8 h. When these data are considered for potential management strategies to reduce the mortality of hammerhead sharks, a limitation on gear soak time would probably improve hammerhead shark survivorship. However, it may prove to be difficult for a fishery to remain economically viable if the soak time is limited to less than the median hooking time for the target species. Additional management options, such as time/area closures, may need to be explored to reduce bycatch mortality of scalloped and great hammerheads.

AB  - Bycatch poses a significant threat to marine megafauna, such as elasmobranchs. India has one of the highest elasmobranch landings globally, through both targeted catch and bycatch. As elasmobranchs contribute to food and livelihood security, there is a need for holistic approaches to bycatch mitigation. We adopt an interdisciplinary approach to critically assess a range of hypothetical measures for reducing elasmobranch capture in a trawler fishery on India’s west coast, using a risk-based mitigation hierarchy framework. Data were collected through landing surveys, interviews and a literature review, to assess the following potential management options for their technical effectiveness and socio-economic feasibility: (1) spatio-temporal closures; (2) net restrictions; (3) bycatch reduction devices (BRDs); and (4) live onboard release. Our study provides the first evidence-based and nuanced understanding of elasmobranch bycatch management for this fishery, and suggestions for future conservation and research efforts. Onboard release may be viable for species like guitarfish, with moderate chances of survival, and was the favored option among interview respondents due to minimal impact on earnings. While closures, net restrictions and BRDs may reduce elasmobranch capture, implementation will be challenging under present circumstances due to the potentially high impact on fisher income. Interventions for live release can therefore be used as a step toward ameliorating bycatch, while initiating longer-term engagement with the fishing community. Participatory monitoring can help address critical knowledge gaps in elasmobranch ecology. Spatio-temporal closures and gear restriction measures may then be developed through a bottom-up approach in the long term. Overall, the framework facilitated a holistic assessment of bycatch management to guide decision-making. Scaling-up and integrating such case studies across different species, fisheries and sites would support the formulation of a meaningful management plan for elasmobranch fisheries in India.

AB  - The Aleutian skate (Bathyraja aleutica) is a large deep-water species that commonly occurs in bycatch of Alaskan trawl and longline fisheries. Although prominent in the skate biomass of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) ecosystems, minimal biological information exists. To increase our understanding of this potentially vulnerable species, and address the possibility of two separate populations in Alaskan waters, the age and growth of B. aleutica was studied. Vertebral centra were examined for age determination, and multiple growth models were evaluated to determine growth characteristics. Skates from the EBS attained maximum ages of 17 and 16 years for females and males, respectively, and the two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth functions generated estimates of k = 0.13 yr.-1 and L∞ = 162.1 cm for females, with similar results for males. Skates from the GOA reached 19 years in females and 18 years in males. Growth parameters of female skates from the GOA were estimated as k = 0.11 yr.-1 and L∞ = 160.0 cm, whereas males grew faster, with estimates of k = 0.15 yr.-1 and L∞ = 138.2 cm. The results of this study may indicate the presence of distinct populations of B. aleutica in the eastern North Pacific.

AB  - After a brief description of purse seining and the other methods used to catch yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, some consideration s are made on the tuna--dolphin association and the solution of the problem of dolphin mortality in the eastern Pacific. The association has been observed in other ocenas, but the frequency of setting in the eastern Pacific is much greater. The mortalities of dolphins through fishing have declined from about 133 000 in 1986 to around 2600 in 1996. The impact of recent levels of mortality on the dolphin populations is not significant from the population point of view. The mortality levels for all the stocks are less than 0.1%, much lower than the 2% value used as a conservative (low) estimate of net recruitment. All dolphin stocks have population sizes between 400 000 and 2 200 000, and most have remained stable for a decade or more. Fishing operations can cause ecological impacts of different types: bycatches, damage to the habitat, mortality caused by lost or discarded gear, pollution, generation of marine debris, etc. A brief discussion follows, with a more detailed look at the bycatches. For convenience we can separate the effects of the fishery on the target species, and on other species. Of the different ways of purse seining for tunas, sets on dolphins catch tuna close to the optimum size to maximize yields and to allow for reproduction, and result in discards of tunas of less than 1% of the catch. Sets on logs catch small tunas, and result in the highest tuna discards (20--25%). School sets fall in the middle from the point of view of the sizes caught. Obviously, from the ecological point of view, sets on dolphins are the best way to harvest yellowfin tuna. After a discussion of the different ecological impacts a fishery can cause to other species on the habitat, a comparison is made of the bycatches generated by the different types of purse seine sets. Billfishes, sharks, mahi-mahi, wahoo and sea turtles are taken as incidental catches by purse seiners. Log sets produce, by far, the largest bycatches, followed by school sets and dolphin sets in that order. The bycatch levels in log sets are usually tens to hundreds of times those in dolphin sets. The difference can be attributed to the selection caused by the speed of movement of the tuna--dolphin group (slow-moving species or individuals cannot keep up with the group), an effect that may be magnified by the chase that precedes the dolphin sets. Log sets, on the other hand, are made on a drifting community. The alternatives left to the fishers if they were forced to switch from the current fishing methods to others are briefly discussed, considering their feasibility, and comparing their ecological costs. From the ecological point of view, and considering that the dolphin mortality is clearly sustainable, the impacts caused by the other types of sets, especially log sets, could be more significant than those caused by the dolphin sets. Some of the species taken in log sets are endangered (e.g. sea turtles), others have unknown status and potential vulnerability because of their low reproductive and juvenile survival rates (e.g. sharks). Overall, the biodiversity of the eastern Pacific appears to be better preserved by a fishery directed to dolphin sets than the other alternatives proposed for the purse seine and for other gears.

AB  - Increasing fishing pressure has negatively impacted elasmobranch populations globally. Despite high levels of historical and current fishing pressure, the Bay of Bengal region remains data‐poor. Focusing on Bangladesh, we conducted a socio‐ecological study to characterize elasmobranch fisheries and evaluate their impact on threatened species. The results demonstrate that several globally threatened elasmobranch species are frequently captured, and some of them have experienced substantial population declines (e.g., wedgefishes, sawfishes, large carcharhinid sharks) over the past decade. A decrease in elasmobranch diversity, abundance, and size of caught specimens was also reported, which was attributed to increased fishing intensity, destructive practices (e.g., bottom trawling), and an accessible elasmobranch market. While catch and trade of more than 90 elasmobranchs are regulated under Bangladesh's law, non‐compliance is widespread. Likely causes include a dearth of awareness, practical alternative livelihoods, and technical facilities, and the complex nature of the fisheries. Encouraging and facilitating the engagement of fishers in science (data collection), local governance (policy‐making), and field implementation (bycatch mitigation) is vital. These interventions must be rooted in sustainable approaches and co‐designed with fishers, with appropriate training available. Development of this work through enhanced engagement with fishers has the potential to transform the elasmobranch fishery situation in Bangladesh and could be used as a model for data‐poor regions.

AB  - Devil rays (Mobula spp.) are globally threatened cartilaginous fishes that have attracted global conservation concern owing to their high extinction risk and lack of protection in many countries. Limited resources and data on threatened marine species, including devil rays, impede conservation actions, particularly in developing countries, many of which have high biodiversity. Devil ray catch is a component of artisanal fisheries in Bangladesh, but data on their fisheries and trade are limited. To characterize devil ray fishing practices, fishers’ perception and trade, 230 fishers and traders were interviewed between 4 June 2018 and 22 June 2019, in four areas of south‐east Bangladesh. Catch data were also opportunistically collected at landing sites. Six devil ray species were documented, caught in an array of gill nets, set‐bag nets and longlines. All interviewed fishers reported life‐long devil ray bycatch in some numbers, and also noted a decline in catch over the last decade. Bottom trawling, increased bycatch levels, increased demand for devil ray products and, in some cases, ecosystem changes were identified by fishers as threats to devil ray populations. Unregulated and undocumented trade and retained bycatch, especially by gill nets and set‐bag nets, are fuelled by local consumption of devil ray meat and international trade in meat and gill rakers. Compliance with international trade control treaties for all Mobula spp. or the Bangladeshi law protecting Mobula mobular was low, with the majority of fishers (87%, n = 174) unaware of their existence. To manage devil ray fisheries, and prevent possible population declines, we propose a combination of legally enforced gear modifications, and catch and trade control through community‐owned implementation strategies. Additionally, we propose the simultaneous implementation of inclusive, community‐based awareness and stewardship projects in conjunction with a coast‐wide ray monitoring programme. Finally, we emphasize that more research and action rooted in a sustainable fishery model is urgently needed to protect Bangladeshi devil ray populations.

AB  - We investigated the composition of the bycatch from research prawn (shrimp) trawling in an area closed to fishing in the northern Great Barrier Reef. By weight, fish made up 69% of the bycatch, sponges 11% and crustaceans 10%. A third of the fish and 45% of the cephalopods floated when discarded. Over 90% of all other groups sank. Floating fish had a modal length of 10cm. The only animals seen to scavenge floating discards at night were dolphins and these were uncommon. During the day, Crested Terns, Frigatebirds and Brown Boobies as well as dolphins and sharks scavenged discards on the surface. The seabirds took fish mostly smaller than 12cm total length, these made up 60% of floating fish. Using the proportion of fish in the discards (69%) and the proportion of fish that floated (33%) with the proportion of fish (60%) that are of the preferred size for scavenging seabirds, we estimated that only 14% of trawling discards are available to seabirds. Thus seabirds consume only a minor amount of prawn trawler discards in this region. The remaining floating discards are presumably either eaten by sharks or dolphins or they may wash upon reefs or the mainland coast. Over 80% by weight of discards sink, some will survive but the majority are scavenged on the seabed mainly by fish, small sharks and possibly cirolanid isopods. The low survival rate of discards indicates that trawlers in the region are killing large numbers of animals that are caught incidentally in nets. Modifications to trawl nets being introduced to reduce bycatch should result in an improvement in this situation.

AB  - Satellite tracking technology has been used to gain information on blue sharks (Prionace glauca, L. 1758) across the major oceans but is lacking in the Mediterranean Sea. Here, blue sharks are ranked as critically endangered due to a high impact of fishing. Blue sharks are often bycaught in longline fisheries. In this study, pop-up archival tags optimized to transmit short-term data for survivorship studies (sPAT, Wildlife Computers) were used to elucidate the vertical movement and provide management strategies for blue sharks bycaught in the swordfish longline fishery in the southern Adriatic Sea. Of 20 tagged individuals, archival data were subsequently obtained from eleven (55 %). Although some individuals were restricted by the bathymetry, two patterns of vertical diel movement were revealed: 1) small and medium sized blue sharks (128- 158 cm TL) display the most regular diel vertical movements, larger blue sharks (189- 206 cm TL) the least regular, more spike-like; 2) most regular diel vertical movements occur during September. Thus, deploying surface longlines in September during daylight hours may reduce blue shark bycatch as well as introducing intervals of reduced surface longline fishing or using mid-water longlines in October.

AB  - Holt, R. E., Foggo, A., Neat, F. C., and Howell, K. L. 2013. Distribution patterns and sexual segregation in chimaeras: implications for conservation and management. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 1198–1205. Chimaeras such as Chimaera monstrosa and Hydrolagus mirabilis are commonly found in commercial bycatch of deep-sea fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic. Very little information exists on their life history, ecology or behaviour. Segregation of populations by sex and/or age classes has been demonstrated in several elasmobranchs, but whether segregation occurs in chimaeras, and if so what mechanisms are involved, remains unknown. This study investigates the distribution and sexual segregation of four species of chimaera (C. monstrosa, H. mirabilis, C. opalescens n. sp. and Harriotta raleighana) in relation to sex, size (maturity) class, bottom depth, and latitude. Data were obtained from annual trawl surveys undertaken by Marine Scotland, Aberdeen, from 1998–2009, at 400–2000 m in the Northeast Atlantic (55–59°N 5–11°W). A factorial General Linear Model (GLM) with planned contrasts indicated complex patterns of age- and sex-related segregation. All adult males and females were sexually segregated by depth: in all four species investigated females occurred at greater depths than males. Potential birthing grounds were identified for H. mirabilis. Latitudinal spatial segregation was not evident in relation to sex or maturity stage. The patterns of segregation reported here suggest a potential for differential exploitation of the sexes by spatially focused fisheries.

AB  - Elasmobranchs contribute heavily to bycatch in longline fisheries globally, and an effective method of deterring them from baited fishing gear is needed. Electrosensory stimulus holds promise as a method of disrupting elasmobranch close-range feeding responses as their electric sense guides their final strike during prey capture. We used laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that weak electric stimuli generated by a prototype electronic bycatch reduction device (BRD) could deter sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) from eating bait. Voltage gradients <1 mV cm−1 at the location of bait were produced by an Arduino microcontroller powered by a 9 V battery and attached to carbon electrodes. Median bait consumption by groups of juvenile sandbar shark declined by 74% when bait was located 10 cm vs. 2 m from active electrodes. Spiny dogfish median bait consumption halved when bait was located 10 cm from active vs. inactive electrodes. Although laboratory studies often produce a larger effect for electrosensory shark deterrents than can be demonstrated during field trials, if the effects seen in our laboratory studies produced similar effects in the field, it could meet fishermen’s requirements for a BRD.

AB  - Conservation of ecologically related species and understanding the discard composition of fisheries are major concerns for marine ecosystem conservation. However, high sea longline fisheries data are insufficient because of difficulties in deploying observers for data collection. Observer data collected from 77 trips on Taiwanese large-scale longline fishing vessels in the Indian Ocean from June 2004 to March 2008 were used to estimate the scale of the bycatch. At least 40 species were recorded. Albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, and southern bluefin tuna were the major species recorded and comprised over 73.30% of the total retained catch. Major bycatch species were swordfish, blue shark, sailfish, pomfret, and escolar. The average discard rate was 14.09%, ranging from 3.20% for the yellowfin tuna fleet to 18.09% for the bigeye tuna fleet. In total, 0.80% of the catch of the albacore, 4.74% of the bigeye, and 2.32% of the yellowfin tuna were discarded. There were significant differences among seasons and areas for the discard rates of the bigeye and yellowfin tuna. The discard rates of the bigeye and southern bluefin tuna were positively correlated to the catch per unit effort. The depredation percentage of tuna by cetaceans was from 0.7% to 12.3% of total discards for the different fleets. The high discard and cetacean depredation rates showed that major possible reasons for discards are depredation by cetaceans, economic factors, and quota limitations. Regarding other species, 61 seabirds and 84 sea turtles were a part of the bycatch. The major species were Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross in the southern Indian Ocean and Olive Ridley turtles in tropical areas. The estimated annual incidental catch numbers were 715 to 311 seabirds and 1856 to 1127 sea turtles from 2004 to 2007. For conservation, this discard information could be used to assess tuna stocks. Mitigation measures, including the live release of small-sized fish, and the use of bird-scaring lines and circle hooks, are required to minimize the bycatch.

AB  - Experimental sets were conducted on a Taiwanese deep set longline fishing vessel operating in the tropical Atlantic Ocean to evaluate the effects of relatively wide circle hooks vs. Japanese tuna hooks with respect to catch rates of both target and incidental species. On circle hooks there were significantly higher catch rates of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (T. albacares), swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and blue sharks (Prionace glauca) as compared to tuna hooks. Significantly higher rates of albacore (T. alalunga) and longbill spearfish (Tetrapterus pfluegeri) were caught on Japanese tuna hooks as compared to circle hooks. Overall, 55 sea turtles were incidentally captured, most (n=47) of which were leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), and capture rates were similar between hook type. Immediate survival rates (percentage alive) when landed were statistically similar for all major target fish species and sea turtles independent of hook type. Most (64%) sea turtles were hooked on the first and second branchlines closest to the float, which are the shallowest hooks deployed on a longline. Lengths of six retained species were compared between hook types. Of these, swordfish was the only species to show a significant difference in length by hook type, which were significantly larger on circle hooks compared to tuna hooks. Additional incentives to use circle hooks would be the increased catch rate in targeted bigeye tuna over traditional Japanese tuna hooks. This international collaboration was initiated in direct response to regional fisheries management organization recommendations that encourage member countries to conduct experiments aimed to identify means to reduce bycatch in longline fishing gear. Information presented may be useful for managers in developing international fisheries policies that aim to balance increases in commercial fishery revenue and endangered species protection.

AB  - Over 90% of those employed in commercial capture fisheries work in the small-scale fisheries (SSF) sector and an estimated 97% of small scale fishers are found in least developed countries. However, the capacity for monitoring SSF globally is low and there is a paucity of data, in particular for remote areas within developing nations. The methods presented here demonstrate a low cost participatory approach for gathering data on small-scale fisheries, in particular for those that take place across remote areas. Community-based data collectors were trained to record biological and socioeconomic data on the traditional (non-motorised) shark fishery in the Toliara region of Madagascar over a six year period (2007–2012). An estimated 20 species of shark were recorded, of which 31% (n=3505) were Sphyrna lewini (scalloped hammerhead), a species listed by the IUCN as Endangered (IUCN, 2016). Although the number of sharks landed annually has not decreased during our survey period, there was a significant decrease in the average size of sharks caught. Despite multiple anecdotal reports of shark population declines, interviews and focus groups highlight the possibility that shark landings appear to have been maintained through changes in gear and increases in effort (eg. number of fishers, time spent fishing), which may mask a decline in shark populations. The numbers of sharks taken by the traditional fishery in our study region was estimated to be between 65,000 and 104,000year−1, whilst estimates using national export and import of dried shark fin from Madagascar, and shark length data in this study, put total landings between 78,000 and 471,851year−1. Reliable data on the total volume of sharks landed in Madagascar’s waters is scarce, in particular from foreign industrial boats both directly targeting shark species and as bycatch in fisheries targeting other species. There is currently no legislation in place to protect sharks from overexploitation in Madagascar and an urgent need to address the lack of shark fishery management across the traditional, artisanal and industrial fisheries.

AB  - The Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) longline fishery is the second most valuable groundfish fishery in Atlantic Canada and received Marine Stewardship Council certification in 2013. The bottom longline fishery accounts for most halibut landings but incidentally catches nontargeted species (bycatch). Since 1998, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the halibut fishing industry performed annual longline surveys across the Scotian Shelf and Southern Grand Banks stock management area to monitor halibut abundance, and at‐sea observers also recorded bycatch information. We examined the species composition and proportion of the survey bycatch and analyzed temporal and spatial trends in standardized weight of (a) halibut catch, (b) total bycatch, and (c) bycatch of species of conservation concern. From 1998 to 2016, 70% of the total catch by weight and 85% by number of individuals were bycatch. Over 100 identified species of finfish, sharks, skates, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals, and seabirds were caught as bycatch in the survey. This included four species listed under the Species at Risk Act (Northern wolffish, Anarhichas denticulatus; spotted wolffish, A. minor; Atlantic wolffish, A. lupus; Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua), and another 14 species awaiting a listing decision based on assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Generally, the standardized weight of halibut and barndoor skate (Dipturus laevis) increased over time, while Atlantic cod, spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), white hake (Urophycis tenuis), and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) decreased. Spatial patterns indicated high bycatch levels on the southern Scotian Shelf and southern edge of the Southern Grand Banks, with hotspots for certain species of conservation concern. Our results identify temporal trends in threatened species and areas where they are susceptible to the Atlantic halibut longline fishery which can inform recovery strategies, bycatch levels and spatial zoning in fisheries management and marine conservation.

AB  - Life-stage-based management of marine fishes requires information on juvenile habitat preferences to ensure sustainable population demographics. This is especially important in the Arctic region given very little is known about the life histories of many native species, yet exploitation by developing commercial and artisanal fisheries is increasing as the ice extent decreases. Through scientific surveys and bycatch data from gillnet fisheries, we document captures of rarely reported juvenile Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus; ≤200 cm total length [TL]) during the ice-free period in the Canadian Arctic. A total of 22 juvenile animals (42 % of total catch; n = 54), including the smallest reliably measured individual of 117 cm TL, were caught on scientific longlines and bottom trawls in Scott Inlet and Sam Ford Trough over three consecutive years. Molecular genetic nuclear markers confirmed species identity for 44 of these sharks sampled; however, two sharks including a juvenile of 150 cm TL were identified as carrying a Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus) mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotype. This represents the first record of a Pacific sleeper shark genetic signature in Greenland sharks in Eastern Arctic waters. Juvenile sharks caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries were only observed offshore in Baffin Bay surrounding a fishery closure area, while larger subadult and mature Greenland sharks (>200 cm TL) were caught in all fishing locations, including areas where juveniles were observed. The repeatable occurrence of juvenile Greenland sharks in a fjord and their presence at two offshore sites indicates that these smaller animals either reside in nurseries or have defined home ranges in both coastal and offshore regions or undertake large-scale inshore–offshore movements.

AB  - Understanding the habitat use and behavior of commercially exploited species throughout ontogeny is useful for devising effective management and conservation strategies. Differences in habitat use can often be exploited to separate target and non-target species, and determinations of home range size can inform the proper scale of conservation actions. In tropical tuna purse seine fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, juvenile silky sharks, Carcharhinus falciformis, comprise a large proportion of the total elasmobranch bycatch. There is now growing recognition of declines in silky shark populations and the need for international collaboration in conservation efforts. Yet, very little is known about the movement behavior or habitat use for this species. In this study, movement behavior of juvenile silky sharks was investigated using pop-up satellite archival tags placed on sharks that were captured during chartered research cruises on a commercial tuna purse seine fishing vessel using drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in the western and central Pacific Ocean and on sharks captured using pelagic longlines in the eastern tropical Pacific. Analysis of horizontal and vertical movement behavior revealed silky sharks spend nearly 100% of their time in the shallow, warm waters of the mixed layer. Juvenile silky shark depth and thermal preferences overlapped with the preferred habitat of the primary target tuna species, indicating vulnerability to capture in purse seine and shallow-set longline fisheries throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean where temperatures range between 24 and 29 °C. Reconstruction of horizontal movements showed dispersal between adjacent national jurisdictions and international waters, highlighting the need for international collaborations in the implementation of conservation measures.

AB  - Bycatch of sharks in longline fisheries has contributed to declines in shark populations and prompted the need for exploring novel technologies to reduce the incidental capture of sharks. One potential strategy is to exploit the unique electrosensory system of sharks, used to detect weak electric fields. Metals from the lanthanide series, made up of neodymium (Nd) and praseodymium (Pr), produce strong electric fields in water. In this study, we tested the effects of an Nd/Pr alloy on shark catch rates. Using longline fishing gear, we compared the catch rates of baited hooks affixed with either a block of the metal alloy (experimental) or a lead weight (control). Four experiments were conducted in different regions of the Pacific Ocean. Two bottom longline experiments were conducted inside and offshore of Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. One of these experiments targeted young of the year scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini), while the other targeted sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). In the Southern California Bight (SCB), pelagic longlines were deployed to target mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and longlines targeting pelagic sharks were set in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) off Ecuador. There was a significant reduction in juvenile hammerhead sharks caught on hooks with the lanthanide metal compared to the controls. In contrast, there was no difference in the catch rates for experiments targeting sandbar sharks in Hawaii or those conducted in the SCB and Ecuador. These results suggest that there are inter-specific differences regarding the effects of lanthanide metals on catch rates. This may reflect the diverse feeding strategies and sensory modalities used by shark species for detecting and attacking prey.

AB  - Hyatt, M.W.; Anderson, P.A., and O'Donnell, P.M., 2018. Influence of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen on the stress response of bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) sharks after capture and handling. Capture and handling stress can induce acidosis in sharks. This response, endured during commercial bycatch and in catch-and-release recreational fisheries, could be exacerbated in certain environmental conditions. To assess environmental influence on stress response, changes in acid-base, blood gas, and metabolite analytes (pH, pCO2, and lactate) measured with the i-STAT portable clinical analyzer were evaluated immediately after capture and removal from gillnets among wild bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) sharks caught in waters of differing temperature (T), salinity (Sal), and dissolved oxygen (DO). Time from capture to blood collection (C-BD) was also recorded. Effects of T, Sal, DO, and C-BD on acid-base physiology were evaluated by modeling their ability to predict pH, pCO2, and lactate concentrations using ordinal logistic regression (OLR). The OLR models suggest that C. leucas sharks experienced a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis in warmer waters and at the low end of their salinity tolerance, and that S. tiburo sharks experienced a metabolic acidosis in warmer waters with a potential for respiratory acidosis at the high end of their salinity tolerance. In S. tiburo, capture and handling time exacerbated acidosis. Based on these findings, it is recommended that commercial and catch-and-release fisheries conduct operations cautiously during times of the year when water temperatures are high and salinities are at either extreme, by decreasing soak times, using the strongest proper tackle gear to reduce fight times, and releasing sharks as soon as possible after capture and detection.

AB  - Shark-like batoids (Rhinopristiformes) represent of some of the most threatened families of sharks and rays. In certain regions, they are a relatively important component of elasmobranch fisheries, commonly taken as bycatch in gillnets and longlines, but also increasingly targeted for their high value fins and meat. This demand, combined with intense fishing pressure, has resulted in global population declines as well as localized extinctions of many rhinopristoids. Yet, information on the life-history, ecology, and conservation status remains scarce for most species. From 2010–2012, data was opportunistically collected from thirteen rhinopristoid species, including four endemic to the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, landed from fisheries in the United Arab Emirates or transported from Oman. Four taxa dominated and comprised 92% of total shark-like batoid landings by number, namely Rhynchobatus spp., the Halavi guitarfish (Glaucostegus halavi), bowmouth guitarfish (Rhina ancylostoma), and Bengal guitarfish (Rhinobatos annandalei). Details of the biological characteristics, including size composition and sex ratios, are presented for each species. While there remain identification challenges related to some unresolved taxonomic issues, with several likely undescribed species occurring in the region, the first regional checklist of rhinopristoids is provided. Evidence of significant declines in landings combined with increasing fishing effort over a short time period raises concern about the status and long-term persistence of many species. Increased research to understand the biology, ecology, diversity, and resilience to harvest by fisheries is critical to the effective management of these species and an urgent precautionary approach to their conservation is warranted.

AB  - In recent years, the eagle ray family Myliobatidae has undergone major taxonomic revisions due to molecular and morphological findings. A new species of eagle ray, Aetomylaeus wafickii sp. nov., is described based on specimens collected from the Arabian Gulf, Northwest Indian Ocean. The new species externally most closely resembles A. caeruleofasciatus White, Last, & Baje, 2015 in White et al. 2016 and A. nichofii (Bloch & Schneider, 1801). It can be distinguished from these species by a combination of morphological and meristic characteristics including a higher number of transverse pale bluish to light grey bands on its dorsal surface (8–10 in Aetomylaeus wafickii sp. nov. vs 5–8 in A. caeruleofasciatus and A. nichofii), a higher number of tooth plate rows (13–15 vs 7), a shorter upper tooth plate width (3.1–4.3 vs 4.6–7.5%DW), and a shorter tail ((0.9–1.6) vs (1.4–1.8)) times disc width. Pelvic fin radial counts separate the new species from A. nichofii for males (14–16 vs 16–19) and females (16–19 vs 20–21). Geographically, it occurs from the southern Red Sea, eastwards to the Arabian Sea, and south to Sri Lanka, including in the Arabian Gulf. It appears to be frequently caught as bycatch in gillnets due to its habit of schooling, and is considered particularly susceptible to impacts from regional fisheries. Morphological and meristic findings complement prior molecular evidence documenting three species within the A. nichofii complex. A key to the genus Aetomylaeus is provided for the first time.

Ectoparasitic copepods were collected from blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) caught as bycatch in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish longline fishery. Up to eight barnacles from the family Lepadidae were observed on three species of copepods; Pandarus satyrus, Dinemoura latifolia, and Ecthrogaleus coleoptratus. The majority were attached to the fourth dorsal plate with barnacle total length at times exceeding 60% of the copepod host length. Only the fourth study to document this type of association, it also identifies E. coleoptratus as a new host record for the family Lepadidae.

AB  - Assessments of incidental wildlife mortality resulting from fishing rarely account for unobserved by-catch. We assessed by-catch of protected and vulnerable wildlife species in an Australian trawl fishery by comparing in-trawl video footage with data collected by an on-board observer. Data were obtained from 44 commercial trawls with two different by-catch reduction devices (BRDs). Eighty-six individuals from six major taxa (dolphins, sharks, rays, sea snakes, turtles and sygnathids) were documented from video analysis, including the endangered scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) and the critically endangered green sawfish (Pristis zijsron). On the basis of the 2008–2009 fishing effort of 4149 trawls and scaling from these results, we estimated the annual catch of protected and vulnerable species (± 1 s.e.) at 8109 ± 910 individuals. Only 34% of by-catch was expelled through the BRDs. Independent observer data for the 44 trawls showed that 77% of the landed by-catch from these taxa were dead when discarded. The results indicate that unaccounted by-catch in trawl fisheries can be substantial, and that current methods of recording by-catch on-board vessels are likely to underestimate total fishing mortality. We recommend gear modifications and their validation through dedicated observer coverage, combined with in-trawl video camera deployments to improve current approaches to by-catch mitigation.

AB  - In the northern Gulf of Mexico, batoids are caught as bycatch in the shrimp trawl fishery and targeted by recreational bowfishers. The vulnerability of these batoid species to overexploitation is primarily dictated by their life history strategies. Lessa’s butterfly ray, Gymnura lessae, is a sexually dimorphic piscivorous batoid ranging from the northern Caribbean Sea to Massachusetts. Species in the family Gymnuridae have small, poorly mineralized centra; as a result, age and growth has only been described in one species, G. altavela. In this study, we examined size at maturity, reproduction, sex-specific growth (using Electronic Length Frequency Analysis), instantaneous natural mortality, and age at maturity of G. lessae in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Overall, 552 G. lessae were sampled from 2016 to 2018, of which 322 were male and 230 were female. Estimated disc width at 50% maturity was 340.0 mm and 461.4 mm for males and females, respectively. Sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth parameter estimates were DW∞ = 427.1 mm, k = 1.34 year−1, and t0 =  −0.35 years for males, and DW∞ = 882.2 mm, k = 0.40 year−1, and t0 =  −0.56 years for females. Instantaneous natural mortality was higher for males (1.48) than females (0.48). Most age-0 males (93.8%, n = 16) and 30.7% of age-0 females (n = 13) appeared to mature fast enough to mate just 1 year after birth. Our results indicate that G. lessae is fast growing, quick maturing, and relatively fecund in the northern Gulf of Mexico and is thus at low risk of overexploitation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Fisheries data is one of the important aspects to understand the basic biology, species distributions and population dynamics of fish stock. One of the efforts to collect data is conducting observer program on tuna longline to improve the understanding of all aspects on fishing operation at the sea. The objectives of this study are to describethe historical development of observers, composition and conservation status of tuna longline vessels catch in Indonesia. Data collection was conducted by observer from August 2005 to November 2013. The method used in this research is descriptive method in which this study aimed to describe the phenomenon that occurs in the tuna longline fishery and catch composition. Tuna longline catches can be categorized into fivegroups, namely, tunas, billfishes, sharks and rays, birds and turtles and other fish. The results showed that the composition of longline tuna catches was dominated by other fish groups with 48.10% followed by tunas 33.85%. Other fish group was dominated by bycatch that have economic value (by product). Data and information gained from observer are very important, so its activity should be perceived as necessity for better fisheries management, rather than as mandatory from Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) regulations. Keywords: catch composition, fisheries management, observer, tuna longline ------- ABSTRAK Data perikanan merupakan salah satu aspek penting untuk memahami biologi dasar, distribusi spesies dan dinamika populasi stok ikan. Salah satu upaya untuk memperoleh data secara tepat adalah dengan melaksanakan program pemantau di atas kapal rawai tuna untuk meningkatkan pemahaman tentang semua aspek pada operasi penangkapan di laut. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui sejarah perkembangan pemantau, mengetahui komposisi dan status konservasi hasil tangkapan pada kapal rawai tuna di Indonesia. Pengumpulan data dilakukan mulai bulan Agustus 2005 hingga November 2013 di kapal rawai tuna yang sebagian besar berbasis di Pelabuhan Benoa, Bali. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode deskriptif dimana penelitian ini ditujukan untuk menggambarkan fenomena yang terjadi pada perikanan rawai tuna dan komposisi hasil tangkapan. Hasil tangkapan rawai tuna dapat dikategorikan ke dalam lima kelompok yaitu: tuna, ikan berparuh, hiu dan pari, burung dan penyu serta ikan lainnya. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa komposisi hasil tangkapan kapal rawai tuna didominasi oleh kelompok ikan lainnya, yaitu sebesar 48,10%, diikuti oleh kelompok tuna 33,85%. Kelompok ikan lainnya ini kebanyakan hasil tangkapan sampingan yang mempunyai nilai ekonomis. Data dan informasi yang diperoleh dari program pemantau ini sangat penting sehingga pelaksanaannya harus dilihat sebagai kebutuhan untuk pengelolaan perikanan yang lebih baik, bukan hanya atas dasar kepatuhan terhadap peraturan dari Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO). Kata kunci: komposisi hasil tangkapan, pengelolaan perikanan, pemantau, rawai tuna

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is one of main conservation problems for many threatened seabirds. Currently, it is unknown whether existing best practices to mitigate seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries influence the capture of other vulnerable taxa. We assessed the effect of two seabird mitigation measures for pelagic longline fisheries on 13 threatened, protected and/or bycaught species, including elasmobranchs, teleosts, sea turtles and fur seals. Analyses were from two experimental studies in Uruguay assessing the effect of a bird scaring line (BSL) and branch lines with weights close to the hooks (weighted branch lines) on these taxa. One hundred longline sets with randomized use of a BSL were deployed. In turn, 224 paired longline sections, with control branch lines versus weighted branch lines, were deployed. BSL use did not increase the capture of any of the species addressed. No detectable differences in capture rate were recorded in our branch line weighting study. However, the effect of branch line weighting in the capture of Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) remains unclear and requires further research. Our study suggests that effective measures to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline have no negative connotations for other vulnerable species. Caution should be exercised when interpreting our results as analyses were underpowered to detect small and subtle differences in the catch rates. We strongly encourage researchers to conduct similar studies to elucidate potential regional and across fisheries differences in the effect of seabird mitigation measures in other vulnerable taxa, as well as the effect that mitigation measures for other taxa may have on seabirds.

AB  - Heterodontus portusjacksoni was obtained from the catches of commercial trawl, gillnet and longline fisheries operating in south-western Australian waters, in which this shark is an abundant bycatch species. Ninety per cent of the H. portusjacksoni caught by commercial trawling in a marine embayment were <400 mm in total length, whereas 99 and 100%, respectively, of the individuals taken by commercial gillnet and longline outside that embayment were >400 mm. Although the differences between the size compositions in the catches obtained by trawling vs both gillnetting and longlining, which were similar, are partly attributable to gear selectivity, they also reflect a use by juvenile H. portusjacksoni of protected nearshore waters as nursery areas and a tendency for larger juveniles and adults to occupy reef/rock habitats in a range of water depths. The fact that all but one of the numerous H. portusjacksoni >800 mm were females is reflected in the ratio of females to males differing significantly from parity in the gillnet and longline samples. Yolked oocytes usually take one year to develop to ovulatory size. Ovulation occurs in late winter to early summer and hatching takes place a year later when the embryo is 180–220 mm. The claspers of males commence rapid growth at a total length of ~450 mm, coincident with the onset of clasper calcification and gonadal maturation. The rate of clasper growth relative to total length reached a maximum at ~570 mm and then declined precipitously as the claspers approached full calcification. Based on gonadal criteria, the L 50 at maturity for females (805 mm) was nearly 40% greater than that for males (593 mm). Values of the deviance information criterion and marked overlap in their 95% confidence intervals demonstrate that the L 50 of 581 mm derived for males using full clasper calcification as the index of maturity was equally valid as the above L 50 derived for males at maturity using gonadal criteria. The capture of substantial numbers of juveniles by trawling and of females < L 50 at maturity by gillnetting and longlining may be having localized effects on the population structure of H. portusjacksoni in south-western Australian waters.

AB  - The assumption of a proportional relationship between catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and the abundance of sharks caught by pelagic longliners is tenuous when based on fisher logbooks that report only retained specimens. Nevertheless, commercial logbooks and landings statistics are often the only data available for stock status assessments. Logbook data collected from local and foreign pelagic longline vessels operating in four areas off southern Africa between 2000 and 2015 were used to construct standardized CPUE indices for blue sharks <i>Prionace glauca</i> and shortfin makos <i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>. Generalized linear mixed models were used to explore the effects of year, month, vessel, fleet and presence of an observer on blue shark and shortfin mako variability. Landing statistics and auxiliary information on the history of the fishery, regulation changes, and market factors were superimposed on the CPUE indices, to test hypotheses that they would influence CPUE trends. Indices in the West and Southwest (Atlantic) areas were elevated for both species, compared to the South and East (Indian Ocean). The scale of year-on-year CPUE increments, up to an order of magnitude for blue sharks, reflected occasional targeting and retention, interspersed with periods where blue sharks were not caught, or discarded and not reported. Increments were smaller for higher value shortfin makos, suggesting that indices were less affected by unreported discarding. CPUE indices and landings of both shark species have increased in recent years, suggesting increased importance as target species. Analysis of logbook data resulted in unreliable indicators of shark abundance, but when trends were interpreted in conjunction with landings data, disaggregated by area and month, and with hindsight of market demand and regulation changes, anomalies could be explained.

AB  - The sharpspine skate Okamejei acutispina is one of the most abundant bycatch species of trawl fishing in the waters of northeastern Taiwan. However, its life history parameters, which are essential for stock assessment and management, are still poorly understood. The objective of this study was to estimate important parameters for this species, including age, growth, age at maturity and mortality. Age estimates were derived from 652 specimens (356 females and 296 males, 9.5–33.8cm in disc width) using vertebral band counts and verified by length-frequency analysis of 1443 specimens (768 females, 675 males) collected between October 2004 and December 2007 in waters off northeastern Taiwan. The sexes-combined relationship between body weight (W) and disc width (DW) was W=0.0193×DW3.0144 (n=1399, p<0.05). Edge analysis indicated that a single growth band pair (comprising translucent and opaque bands) is formed each year, with up to 11 band pairs for females and 10 band pairs for males. The Robertson growth function had the best fit for both sexes and the growth parameters including 95% confidence intervals were estimated as follows: asymptotic disc width (DW∞)=32.4 (31.3–34.0) cm DW, growth coefficient (k)=0.367 (0.315–0.426)yr−1 for females; and DW∞=28.8 (27.6–30.3)cm DW, k=0.365 (0.311–0.424)yr−1 for males. Age at maturity was estimated to be 7.2 and 6.8 yrs for females and males, respectively, while longevity was estimated to be 13.2 and 13.3 yrs, respectively. Length-frequency analysis produced similar results, supporting the vertebral aging estimates. Total mortality was estimated to be 0.85 and 0.86yr−1, while natural mortality was 0.32 and 0.32yr−1 for females and males, respectively. Our study indicates that it is likely that the sharpspine skate is at the margin of optimal exploitation and therefore close monitoring and seasonal closure management of trawl fishing are recommended to ensure sustainable utilization of this stock.

AB  - Pelagic longline fishing has been identified as a significant threat to endangered sea turtle populations. Reducing sea turtle bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, in concert with activities to reduce other anthropogenic mortality sources, may halt and reverse population declines. Here, we examine the effect of bait manipulation as a simple mitigation method that could reduce sea turtle interactions with longline fishing gear. We analyzed laboratory experiments and field trials conducted in the Mediterranean, the northeast Distant Area in the Atlantic and the Western North Pacific. Studies showed that turtles are more likely to feed on squid than on mackerel when both are used simultaneously as bait. The stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca, used as bait, was more effective than mackerel; this ray was vulnerable and stimulated much thought about other species to use as alternative bait. Effective in laboratory conditions with captive turtles, dyed and artificial bait did not seemed to be effective in reducing turtle bycatch in field conditions. Optimal mitigation measure must reduce incidence of hooking of threatened sea turtles to acceptable levels and also offer an economic advantage to fisheries. Studies concerning the effect of bait modification to reduce turtle bycatch highlight the importance of an integrated approach towards sensory deterrents, as both visual and chemical cues are likely to attract sea turtles to longline gear. Further research on the development of sensory-based deterrents can contribute to reduced sea turtle bait interactions and maintain catch rates of target species.

AB  - Bycatch in commercial fisheries is a pressing conservation concern and has spurred global interest in adopting ecosystem-based management practices. To address such concerns, a thorough understanding of spatiotemporal relationships among bycatch species, their environment and fisheries is required. Here we used a generalized linear mixed model framework incorporating spatiotemporal random effects to model abundance patterns for 3 skate species caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries (thorny skate Amblyraja radiata , winter skate Leucoraja ocellata and smooth skate Malacoraja senta ), as well as 10 target species on the Scotian Shelf, NW Atlantic. Spatiotemporal estimates of relative abundance for at-risk skates within the years 2005-2015 were modelled from research trawl survey data and overlaid with those for target species to identify hotspots of bycatch risk. In addition, abundance estimates for at-risk skates within the years 1975-1985, a period of higher stock abundance, were used to identify areas of previously important habitat. Historically, skate species densely occupied areas near Sable Island and Banquereau Banks, Georges Bank and the Bay of Fundy. Bycatch hotspots between at-risk skates and commercial targets were identified in regions across the Scotian Shelf. These hotspots were independently validated by predicting species presence from at-sea observer data that monitor skate bycatch directly. We discuss spatial relationships between target and bycatch species, highlighting limitations of at-sea observer programmes that this method helps to address. This framework can be applied more broadly to inform ecosystem management and priority areas for conservation or fisheries regulation.

AB  - Unintended bycatch of depleted or vulnerable marine species is an unsolved conservation issue that undermines the sustainability of fisheries worldwide. In Canada, policy incentives to address bycatch of vulnerable species-at-risk have become more prominent in recent years. Yet bycatch risk has been difficult to quantify and mitigate, in part due to large data gaps in fisheries observation and monitoring. Here we suggest the use of novel modelling frameworks to optimize spatial management strategies for bycatch mitigation. We utilize spatiotemporal modeling of fisheries-independent survey data to predict high-risk regions for three at-risk skates (family Rajidae) in Atlantic Canada. We use these identified regions to evaluate the relative reduction in bycatch risk that can be expected by closing targeted bycatch-protection zones on the western Scotian Shelf to bottom-trawl fishing, and further examine the relative costs to the fishing industry that such closures may impose. We show that when closures are precisely targeted on high-bycatch risk areas, relative costs to industry are minimal by affected fishing area (1.25 ± 0.62 % total area) or displaced landings (0.28 ± 0.14 % by weight of catch). To reduce bycatch risk by 50 % for all three vulnerable skates, less than 10 % of landed catch weight is displaced. These results can be used to reduce bycatch encounters for any endangered, threatened or protected species through spatially targeted conservation measures. We conclude that new approaches to the analysis and mitigation of spatial-temporal bycatch patterns can help to meet regulatory or market-driven requirements for bycatch reduction at low cost.

AB  - Pelagic Pacific sea turtles eat relatively large quantities of plastic (median 5 g in gut). Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we identified the polymers ingested by 37 olive ridley, 9 green, and 4 loggerhead turtles caught as bycatch in Hawaii- and American Samoa-based longline fisheries. Unidentifiable samples were analyzed using high-temperature size exclusion chromatography with multiple detectors and/or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Regardless of species differences in dive depths and foraging strategies, ingested plastics were primarily low-density, floating polymers (51% low-density polyethylene (LDPE), 26% polypropylene (PP), 10% unknown polyethylene (PE), and 5% high-density PE collectively). Albeit not statistically significant, deeper diving and deeper captured olive ridley turtles ate proportionally more plastics expected to sink (3.9%) than intermediate-diving green (1.2%) and shallow-diving loggerhead (0.3%) turtles. Spatial, but no sex, size, year, or hook depth differences were observed in polymer composition. LDPE and PP, some of the most produced and least recycled polymers worldwide, account for the largest percentage of plastic eaten by sea turtles in this region. These novel data inform managers about the threat of plastic ingestion to sea turtles and may motivate development of more environmentally friendly practices for plastic production, use, and waste management.

AB  - The thornback ray Raja clavata is one of the most abundant bycatch species of trawl fishing in the waters of the Gulf of Gabès, but little is known about its life history in this area. The present study provides the first data on age and growth of this species in Tunisian waters, as well as additional data on its reproduction. The age of individuals was estimated by counting growth bands on central vertebral sections. Marginal increment and edge analysis supported the hypothesis of annual deposition of growth bands, with the opaque band formed during autumn. The parameters estimated from von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth functions showed differences between sexes. The oldest thornback ray female was aged 15 years (104 cm TL), whereas the oldest male was 12 years (89 cm TL). Variations in the gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices of both sexes and the presence of vitellogenic activity in mature females during the year indicated that the species cannot be considered to be a continuous spawner. Males were found to mature between 55 and 75 cm TL, whereas females matured between 72.4 and 85 cm TL. The TL at which 50% of the population reached maturity was 67.44 and 81.42 cm for males and females, respectively. Males and female thornback rays mature, respectively, at approximately 5.3 and 7 years old.

AB  - Blue shark and shortfin mako are key pelagic shark species distributed throughout the temperate and tropical waters of the world’s oceans. These species are caught in the North Pacific by Japanese longline fisheries as bycatch and occasionally targeting blue shark. Japanese research and training vessels (JRTVs) have been collecting fishery-independent data on these sharks in the western and central North Pacific since 1992. However, the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) estimated from the fishery-independent data had not been used for stock assessments due to an issue concerning reporting after the 2000s. In this study, a statistical filtering method was used to remove unreliable set-by-set data collected by JRTVs. The nominal CPUE of the JRTVs was then standardized using the spatio-temporal generalized linear mixed model to provide the spatial and temporal changes in the CPUEs of these sharks in the North Pacific. The hotspots of blue shark appeared in temperate waters of the western and central North Pacific, whereas those of shortfin mako were distributed in coastal and offshore waters along the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone and the Mixed Water Region. The yearly changes in the CPUE of blue shark illustrated a downward trend until 2008 and an upward trend thereafter, whereas those of shortfin mako exhibited a flat trend with large fluctuations from 1994 to 2008, and a down-and-up trend thereafter. The information predicted from the fishery-independent data is very useful for improving the stock assessment and management of these sharks as it provides an understanding of spatio-temporal changes in the hotspots and temporal changes in the catch rates.

AB  - Spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) comprise a significant unwanted bycatch on demersal longlines set for halibut, sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in shelf waters of the east and west coasts of North America. Recently, rare-earth magnets and metals have been shown to have deterrent effects on sharks. These effects are likely the result of magnetic or electric fields created by these materials in seawater, which are sensed and avoided by sharks. Our earlier laboratory studies showed that attack rates by spiny dogfish on baits protected with cerium mischmetal (a rare-earth alloy) were reduced and suggested that this metal might reduce unwanted bycatch of spiny dogfish in setline fishing for Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). We conducted a field study near Homer, Alaska in September 2007 with three hook treatments interspersed on 36 longline sets. These included standard circle hooks used in the halibut fishery, hooks with small pieces of cerium mischmetal attached above the hook, and hooks with a similar (but inert) mild steel piece above the hook. Fewer dogfish were caught on hooks with mischmetal than on either of the two other treatments. Reductions in catch of longnose skate (Raja rhina) also occurred on hooks protected with mischmetal. However, halibut catch did not increase with protected hooks. Limitations in using mischmetal in commercial operations are expense, hazardous nature, and relatively rapid hydrolysis in seawater.

AB  - Blue marlin Makaira nigricans, striped marlin Tetrapturus audax, and pelagic sharks (e.g., blue shark Prionace glauca) are commonly caught as bycatch by longline fisheries in the central North Pacific Ocean. Recently, concern has increased about depletion of these species. Modifications in longline gear may offer one solution. Here, we test the use of circle hooks, rather than the conventional tuna‐style hooks, on longlines using an ecosystem model of the central North Pacific Ocean. The simulations considered span a range of reasonable circle hook catchability and survival rates for released fish. The results suggest that if circle hooks have higher catchability than the currently used tuna‐style hooks, switching to circle hooks depletes marlin biomass by 25–40% and shark biomass by 15–35% over 30 years. However, these depletions do not occur if circle hook catchability is equal to or lower than that of tuna‐style hooks. When the effects of catch‐and‐release requirements for marlins and sharks were also considered, we found that regardless of assumptions about circle hook catchability and survival rates, a combined policy of using circle hooks and releasing sharks and marlins leads to net increases in marlin and shark abundance. The simulations show a trade‐off between the abundance of marlins and sharks and their prey items, yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares and small blue sharks. There is also evidence of trophic trade‐offs between yellowfin tuna and small blue sharks and their prey, small scombrids (Auxis spp.) and mahi mahi Coryphaena hippurus. The results illustrate the importance of understanding catchability and survival rates for circle hooks compared with those for tuna‐style hooks and encourage further research in this area.

AB  - Context Sharks are frequently caught as bycatch in trawl fisheries in the North Aegean Sea. However, very little information exists on their biology and ecology in the area. Aims Biological parameters and spatial segregation of sharks in relation to size class, sex, depth and geographic location were examined. Methods Morphological characteristics and generalised additive models were used to explore biological traits and aggregating behaviour respectively, by using data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey between 2014 and 2021. Key results Overall, 7761 specimens were measured, with Scyliorhinus canicula, Galeus melastomus and Squalus blainville being the most common species. Scyliorhinus canicula was found in shallow coastal waters, whereas the remaining species were detected in deeper waters. Conclusions Females were larger and heavier than males and the weight–length relationships corroborated size differences between sexes in all species, whereas allometric growth did not share the same patterns as those from the Mediterranean Sea. Generalised additive models showed that the distribution of dominant species is bathymetric and geographically dependent. Additionally, the depth and geographic segregation patterns are highly associated with ontogeny and not sex. Implications These findings highlighted the importance of incorporating elasmobranch behavioural characteristics in the poorly developed management regulations in the North Aegean Sea.

AB  - The recently developed statistical learning method boosting is introduced for use with fisheries data. Boosting is a predictive technique for classification that has been shown to perform well with problematic data. The use of boosting algorithms AdaBoost and AsymBoost, with decision stumps, are described in detail, and their use is demonstrated with shark bycatch data from the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna purse-seine fishery. In addition, results of AdaBoost are compared to those obtained from generalized additive models (GAM). Compared to the logistic GAM, the prediction performance of AdaBoost was more stable, even with correlated predictors. Standard deviations of the test error were often considerably smaller for AdaBoost than for the logistic GAM. AdaBoost score plots, graphical displays of the contribution of each predictor to the discriminant function, were also more stable than score plots of the logistic GAM, particularly in regions of sparse data. AsymBoost, a variant of AdaBoost developed for binary classification of a skewed response variable, was shown to be effective at reducing the false negative ratio without substantially increasing the overall test error. Boosting shows promise for applications to fisheries data, both as a predictive technique and as a tool for exploratory data analysis.

AB  - The U.S. Atlantic coastal pelagic longline fishery that targets tunas and swordfish also interacts with a wide range of non-target species including billfishes and sea turtles. Preliminary studies indicate that a change in terminal gear from J-style hooks to circle hooks may reduce bycatch mortality, but the effects of this change on catch rates of target species are unclear. To evaluate this, we monitored catch composition, catch rates, hooking location, and number of fish alive at haulback during 85 sets in the fall and spring seasonal fisheries from a commercial vessel operating in the western North Atlantic. Circle (size 16/0, 0° offset) and J-style (size 9/0, 10° offset) hooks were deployed in an alternating fashion. Hook–time recorders were used to assess time at hooking and temperature–depth recorders to measure gear behavior. Catch rates for most species categories were not significantly different between hook types (P<0.05), although circle hooks generally had higher tuna catch rates in the fall and lower swordfish catch rates in the spring. In the fall, both total catches and catches of pelagic rays were significantly higher on J-style hooks. Yellowfin tuna in the fall and dolphinfish in the spring caught on circle hooks were significantly larger than those caught on J-style hooks. In both seasonal fisheries, circle hooks caught fishes in the mouth more frequently than J-style hooks, which hooked more often in the throat or gut, although these differences between hook types were not statistically significant. Yellowfin tuna in the fall fishery were over four times more likely to be hooked in the mouth with circle hooks than with J-style hooks. Several target and bycatch species showed higher rates of survival at haulback with circle hooks, although only for dolphinfish in the fall fishery was this difference statistically significant. Our results suggest that the use of 0° offset circle hooks in the coastal pelagic longline fishery will increase the survival of bycatch species at haulback with minimal effects on the catches of target species.

AB  - Efforts to conserve and manage shark populations are often hampered by a lack of basic data, such as species-specific landings and distribution ranges. We bridge this gap in coastal East Africa by providing data on the distributions, catch rates, morphometrics, and exploitation status of shark species in Kenyan coastal waters. Data were collected from artisanal fishers and from bycatch taken by shallow-water (10–50 m) prawn trawlers from Malindi-Ungwana Bay and demersal research trawlers (10–150-m depth) along the ∼640-km coastline, over a 12-month period (June 2012 to May 2013). A total of 1 893 individual sharks (representing 20 species and 11 families) were sampled from the artisanal fishery (n = 1 610) and the trawlers (n = 283). The demersal trawl bycatches were dominated by the African angelshark Squatina africana (2.39 kg h–1), shortnose spurdog shark Squalus megalops (1.48 kg h–1) and African spotted catshark Holohalaelurus punctatus (0.11 kg h–1). Catches of the scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini (0.73 kg h–1), smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena (0.60 kg h–1) and grey reef shark Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos (0.77 kg h–1) dominated in the prawn trawlers. Only a few species (S. lewini, C. amblyrhynchos, and blacktip reef shark Carcharhinus melanopterus) showed a coast-wide distribution in the artisanal fishery. Artisanal fishers harvested mostly immature specimens of S. lewini, C. melanopterus and blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus, suggesting that the fishery might be unsustainable in the long-term. The Endangered S. lewini is the most vulnerable to overexploitation on the Kenyan coast, with most specimens landed (>90%) being below the size at maturity. Data are also presented on morphometric relationships and observed or estimated exploitation reference points (maximum observed length Lmax, asymptotic length L∞, mean length at first maturity Lm, and optimum length Lopt) for the commonly landed species. A more comprehensive coast-wide National Plan of Action is recommended for the management of shark populations in Kenya.

AB  - The circle hook experiments were conducted to compare the catch rates of target and bycatch species between J hook and circle hooks in the tuna longline fishery of the eastern Pacific Ocean between from July 15 to August 12, 2005. In the target species group no significant differences among 3 types hook, between size 4.0 traditional tuna hooks(J-4) and size 15 circle hooks(C15), and between C15 and size 18 circle hooks(C18) were revealed, but significant differences were found between J-4 and C18. In the bycatch species group significant differences were found among 3 types hook, between J 4 and C15, and between J-4 and C18, but no significant differences were revealed between C15 and C18. Large circle hook(C18) had the lowest catch rate for tunas and for other fishes, and the small circle hook(C15) had lowest rate for billfishes and sharks. The length distributions for bigeye tuna are very similar for the 3 hook types. There were very slight differences in length size between hook types in the bycatch species.

AB  - Commercial fisheries, especially pelagic longline fisheries targeting tuna and/or swordfish, often land silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), which are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Due to increasing fishing effort and the fact that they overlap in habitat with target species, the population trend of silky sharks is declining worldwide. Understanding their relationships with environmental variables that lead to their capture by fisheries is critical for their management and conservation. Nevertheless, little is known about their size distribution in relation to environmental variables in the Pacific Ocean. Using data from the Chinese Observer Tuna Longline fishery from 2010 to 2020, this study developed a species distribution model (SDM) to analyze the relationships between silky shark size distribution patterns and environmental variables and spatio-temporal variability at fishing locations. Observed sizes ranged from 36 to 269 cm fork length (FL). The final model suggests that sea surface temperature (SST), primary production (photosynthetically available radiation, PAR), and ocean surface winds were the key environmental variables shaping size distribution patterns of silky sharks in the Pacific. A high proportion of larger silky sharks has been predicted in areas associated with productive upwelling systems. In addition, the model predicted that larger specimens (>140 cm FL) occur near the equator, and smaller specimens farther from the equator but still in tropical regions. Two regions in the eastern Pacific (the coastal upwelling area off northern Peru and the waters around the Galapagos Islands) seem to be important locations for larger specimens. The size distribution patterns of silky sharks in relation to environmental variables presented in this study illustrate how this species segregates spatially and temporally and presents potential habitat preference areas. The information obtained in the present study is critical in the quest for management and conservation of menaced species such as the silky shark.

AB  - This study evaluated the potential to reduce the bycatch of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in a flatfish trawl fishery by developing a selective trawl that separates flatfish from rockfish using differences in their behavior as the trawl net approaches. Using an alternate haul, randomized block design, we compared catches between a commonly used combination trawl and a newly designed, low-rise trawl incorporating a "cutback" headrope. For most of the target flatfish species, the experimental trawl had a 25–59% higher catch rate (kilograms) than the control net (P < 0.05), consistent with greater footrope length in the experimental trawl. Increased catches of some small rockfish, skates, and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) were also observed (P < 0.05). The catches of many larger roundfish and rockfish species, including canary rockfish (Sebastes pinniger), redstripe rockfish (Sebastes proriger), Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and shortspine thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) more than 25 cm long, were reduced from 34 to 97% in the experimental trawl (P < 0.05). Under weak-stock management conditions, in which the bycatch of overfished rockfish species limits directed flatfish fisheries, trawl designs that permit nontarget species to escape before entrainment can significantly reduce bycatch mortality and prevent premature closures of directed flatfish fisheries.

AB  - Mitigating the environmental impact of commercial fishing, by avoiding, minimizing and compensating for adverse effects, is core business for fisheries management authorities globally. The complex interplay of ecological, economic, and social considerations has often resulted in bycatch management being reactive, confrontational and costly. In many cases it has been difficult to demonstrate success and to establish whether bycatch management has been efficient or effective. This article proposes standards for bycatch management following reviews of literature, international agreements and Australian domestic fishery management policies, and consideration by many technical experts and several stakeholder representatives. The standards have been developed using Australian Commonwealth fisheries – and the international fisheries agreements to which Australia is party – as a baseline, but should be applicable to both domestic and regional/international governance systems. The proposed standards involve quantifying fisheries bycatch, agreeing on operational objectives, assessing the effects of fishing on bycatch populations, establishing the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures, and evaluating performance. The standards encourage domestic management measures that are consistent with the guidance and requirements of international agreements and regional fisheries management organisations. The importance of engaging stakeholders throughout the process is recognised. The standards provide a framework for measuring performance and a checklist of actions for managing bycatch at a fishery level. They have the potential to facilitate the development of more strategic and effective approaches to bycatch management, with defined goals, monitoring systems, and adaptive decision-making. This review of past bycatch management, including the application of the proposed standards to the mitigation of shark bycatch in an Australian longline fishery, demonstrates that the proposed standards are operationally feasible but that they have not always been applied. Specifically, monitoring the performance of bycatch management measures has not always followed their implementation.

AB  - Cetacean bycatch in fisheries occur in all oceans of the world and may have both lethal and non-lethal consequences (body injuries). In the lagoon of Mayotte (12o50’S, 45o10’E), in the northern Mozambique Channel, two main types of fisheries occur: handlining (inside the lagoon) and longlining (outside the barrier reef, over the ‘continental’ slope). The level of interactions between small cetaceans and fisheries in this area were characterised using identification photographs taken from July 2004 to April 2008 during dedicated cetacean surveys. Photographs were taken of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops aduncus ), melon-headed whales ( Peponocephala electra ) and short-finned pilot whales ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ). Injuries on the dorsal region (especially the dorsal fin) were characterised and related to fisheries or intra-/inter-specific interactions (with sharks and other cetacean species). The results suggest interactions with fisheries involving the three species around Mayotte. The occurrence of interactions was the highest in the most coastal species, i.e. T. aduncus . This study shows that interactions between fisheries and small cetaceans occur at varying levels around Mayotte. It also confirms the utility of scars as indicators of fishery exposure to cetaceans.

AB  - Bycatch is the most significant threat to marine megafauna (sea turtles, marine mammals, elasmobranchs, seabirds) worldwide, and the leading cause of the decline of several cetacean species. The bycatch issue in the Indian Ocean is poorly understood, but high bycatch levels in gillnet fisheries have been documented for the past two decades, in both small‐scale and semi‐industrial fisheries. Unfortunately, methods to reduce bycatch are often unavailable, financially non‐viable or socially unacceptable to fishermen. Using a network of trained boat captains in the tuna drift gillnet fishery in the Arabian Sea, targeted catch and bycatch data were collected from 2013 to 2017 off the coast of Pakistan (northern Indian Ocean). Two fishing methods using multifilament gillnets were used: surface deployment and subsurface deployment (i.e. headline of net set below 2 m depth). Predicted catch rates for targeted species did not differ significantly between the two fishing practices, although a drop in tuna (6.2%) and tuna‐like (10.9%) species captures was recorded in subsurface sets. The probability of cetacean bycatch, however, was 78.5% lower in subsurface than in surface sets. Cetacean bycatch in tuna drift gillnet fisheries has the potential to be significantly reduced at a relatively low cost for fishers. However, further research with an appropriate sampling design and a large sample size is required to confirm the efficacy of the proposed mitigation method. The acceptability and adoption of subsurface setting by fishers also needs to be further investigated. Despite some limitations, this preliminary study also highlights the importance of crew‐based observer data as an alternative source of data when observers cannot be deployed on fishing vessels.

AB  - Incidental capture or ‘bycatch’ of non-targeted species is a global fisheries issue that threatens ocean ecosystems and the conservation and recovery of protected species. Many protected species are at a high risk of incidental capture and mortality in commercial fisheries, which could have an impact on already decreasing populations. From 1998 to 2017, U.S. federal fisheries observers aboard fishing vessels in the U.S. Southeast Gillnet Fishery collected data on captures of encountered protected species. Data collected by the observers were used to describe protected species incidental capture within this fishery. A generalized linear zero-inflated negative binomial two-part model (GLM-ZINB) was applied to determine which environmental and fishing characteristic factors influence the probability of incidental capture of protected species including leatherback, Dermochelys coriacea, and loggerhead, Caretta caretta, sea turtles, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, and giant manta ray, Manta birostris. While a variety of factors were considered in our models, no one single factor was found to influence all protected species. Incidental capture of leatherback turtles was influenced by season, depth, and gillnet depth, while loggerhead turtles were influenced by season, sea surface temperature, and target species of the fishery. Bottlenose dolphin bycatch was most influenced by soak duration, gear type, and season, while giant manta ray captures were influenced by soak duration, gear type, and depth. Environmental factors and fishing characteristics associated with incidental capture of protected species can be used to help guide fishery managers as to what species-specific regulations could be implemented to help mitigate capture.

AB  - Managing the sustainability of bycatch species is important for many fisheries worldwide. However, high survey costs, rarity of vulnerable bycatch species, and widespread use of bycatch reduction devices, increase the difficulty of assessing sustainability. We developed a sample size estimation framework using zero-inflated count models that incorporated the mean catch, catch variability, and the impact of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) on bycatch sampling for a subset of bycatch species in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). Minimum sample sizes required to detect small to moderate declines (10–25%) in the mean catch were too high for many species in the short term (5y) and above the capacity of the fishery (28,080 trawls per year), because of the high exclusion rates from TEDs and BRDs. For sampling periods beyond 5y, detection of either a 25% or a 50% decline was possible for some more common species of elasmobranchs, sea snakes and all species of fish. In conclusion, sampling on commercial trawl vessels cannot evaluate changes in sea turtle abundance and some of the larger elasmobranchs. However, the monitoring of sea snakes and fishes is viable using these methods if catch rates are well correlated with effort and the target species.

AB  - This article reviews the importance of bait, bait loss, and depredation in longline fishery operations worldwide. In general, fish bait is preferred over squid due to reduced sea turtle and elasmobranch bycatch. However, there are many reports which have indicated high shark catch and deep hooking when using fish as bait. High and low hooking rates for blue shark have been reported from different fishing areas when using mackerel as bait, indicating the need for further studies on selection of appropriate baits. Conflicting results from many part of the world on the catching efficiency of different bait species on target and nontarget species indicate the need to consider area, species specific and cross taxa effect of various combinations of baits and hooks, before their adoption in commercial fishing. Baiting pattern has also been reported to affect the catch rates significantly. The review has revealed that bait loss and depredation on the hooked fish cause considerable damage to the fishery and significant economic loss. Loss rates can be significantly minimized using squids as bait while it may also incur a high catch rate of bycatch. The review has confirmed the superiority of natural baits over alternative and artificial baits during the longline fishing operations. Though an effective substitute for the natural bait has not been developed, so far, such alternatives which make use of the food and foraging behavior and the olfactory response of the fish are necessary for future development of longline fisheries.

AB  - Bycatch from the experimental longline operations in the Lakshadweep Sea were studied. The experiments were conducted on converted Pablo boats, originally used for pole and line fishing operations, to capture skipjack tuna in the Lakshadweep Islands. The overall bycatch rate was very high, with a mean hooking rate of 8.05/1000 hooks compared to the targeted tuna catch (1.75/1000 hooks). Bycatch contributed 82.4% of the catch in comparison to the tuna (17.6%) Thunnus albacares, in the longline operations. Silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformes) with 89.9% was the dominant shark species followed by C. amblyrhynchos, Galeocerdo cuvier, Alopias pelagicus, Negapriion acutedens and Sphyrna lewinii with 4.7, 2.7, 1.4, 0.7 and 0.7%, respectively. Sharks contributed to 74.1% of the catch, followed by 15.7% sailfishes and 10.2% miscellaneous fishes. Higher bycatch rates were evident during evening hours compared to mornings, but the results were not significant statistically. Studies on the effects of depth on the overall fishing performance and species selectivity failed to establish any significant relationship at a depth range of 35–100 m. Soaking time had a significant effect on bycatch rates. The hooking rate of sharks declined with an increase in soaking time. Considering the high shark bycatch in the fishery, an accurate monitoring of the longline fish catches in the Lakshadweep waters is an important step towards ensuring the sustainability of other populations, especially sharks.

AB  - Discard has long been recognized a serious problem in the world’s oceans affecting not only the non-target species but also entire trophic food chain and habitats thus disrupting marine ecosystem functioning. Due to global declines, species of conservation interest (e.g. sharks, rays, turtles, dolphins) which are crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem have become a focus of marine conservation in recent years. Although effort has been made to elucidate the historical trends of discards and, its effects on the marine fisheries worldwide, most of these are based on the data-rich developed countries. This has been largely unexplored in many of the developing countries such as Bangladesh, especially for industrial marine fisheries. Here in this study, we tried to fill this knowledge gap using discard data collected from the bottom and mid-water freezer trawler from the marine water of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal. It was revealed that both the bottom and mid-water trawling has the similar level of effect on the number of total discarded species of conservation interest (SOCI) although the number of shark discard was significantly higher in bottom trawling. The historical reconstruction of total discards of SOCI from freezer trawler suggests an increase of over six times between 1990 and 2014. The increasing number of hauls (both in the bottom and mid-water trawl) and the increase in the speed at bottom hauling both have a significant negative effect on SOCI especially shark. We suggest a strong implementation of existing laws, increasing the capacity of surveillance and the monitoring systems as well as improved technological fix such as gear modification can substantially lower the discarded bycatch from Bangladesh marine water.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment(ERA), developed in Australia, can be used to estimate the risk of target, bycatch and protected species from the effects of fishing using limited data for stock assessment. In this study, we employed the ERA approach to estimate risks to tunas, billfishes, sharks, sea turtles and other species by the Korean tuna longline fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean using productivity and susceptibility analyses of the ERA based on low(1.84). Albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, skipjack and bluefin tunas were generally evaluated in the medium risk. The susceptibility of tuna species, however, had higher risks than the productivity. Billfishes were also at medium risk, while sharks were at high risk by the tuna longline fishery. The risk of productivity was generally high, because most sharks caught by the tuna longline fishery have high longevities, i.e., over 10 years, including ovoviviparous species. Susceptibility, which is related with the selection of fishing gear, was also high, because the longline fishery has no gear modifications to prevent bycatch of protected species. Not only target tuna species were influenced by the tuna longline fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, but also nontarget species, such as pomfret, mackerels rays, sea turtle were done. Ecosystem-based fishery assessment tools, such as productivity and susceptibility analysis(PSA), have the ability to provide broad scientific advice to the policy makers and stakeholders.

AB  - Due to global declines, skates and sharks have become a focus of marine conservation in recent years. Despite protective measures, they remain vulnerable to bycatch by fisheries, especially bottom-trawls and pose a problem for fisheries management measures that aim to eliminate discards in the future. In the mixed-species bottom-trawl fisheries of the North Atlantic catches can be increased by fitting a length of chain known as a “tickler” in front of the groundgear of the trawl. It was hypothesized that the tickler is especially effective at catching skates and rays that may otherwise escape beneath the net. A trial was undertaken with paired tows with and without the tickler chain. The trial demonstrated that the catch rate of skates and sharks can be significantly lowered by removing the tickler. A set of secondary nets (groundgear bags) attached behind the groundgear of the main net allowed the number of fish escaping under the net to be estimated and showed that the reduction of skates and sharks in the main net was accompanied by an increase in number in the groundgear bags. This suggests that prohibition of the use of tickler chains in areas that are known to be especially important to skates and sharks could have conservation benefits. The removal of the tickler chain had little effect on catch rates of haddock, whiting, and flatfish, but caused a marked decrease in the catch rate of commercially valuable anglerfish.

AB  - Shrimp trawl fisheries capture several species of elasmobranchs as bycatch that are commonly unreported, this lack of data makes it difficult to assess their populations using quantitative stock assessment methods. Rapid evaluations like the productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA), can help to determine species at risk of overexploitation and prioritize research, management and conservation efforts. The relative vulnerability (V) of 16 elasmobranch species associated to the Mexican shrimp trawl fishery in the Gulf of Mexico was determined using a PSA. The information of bycatch elasmobranch was collected by observer’s onboard shrimp fishing vessels in 55 fishing trips during the 2013–2017 period. Two hypothetical scenarios to test potential management strategies were developed to observe changes in V based on the current fishing practices. We determined that most elasmobranch species (n= 14) had low V (<1.8) related to this fishery, mostly as a result of the high productivity (P) of the coastal-demersal species and the low susceptibility (S) of the coastal-semioceanic ones. Only two species had a moderate V, Pseudobatos lentiginosus (1.87) and Squatina dumeril (1.85). The vulnerability of these two species could decrease through ensuring post-capture release practices and the protection of their aggregation, since both actions would lower their S and V. Post-capture release might be the most feasible potential strategy for both species, whereas protection of species aggregations would require further investigation to support its effect in the mitigation of mortality from bycatch.

AB  - Identification of the factors influencing the distribution of vulnerable species can be useful for predicting their occurrence at a local to regional scale and for identifying the most suitable measures of management and conservation. We used generalized additive models to assess the effects of spatiotemporal, environmental, and operational factors on the catches of two myliobatids: the Common Eagle Ray Myliobatis aquila and the Bull Ray Pteromylaeus bovinus. Fishing data were collected from commercial midwater trawlers operating in the north‐central Adriatic Sea during 2006–2013. Presence/absence and abundance (CPUE) data were modeled separately, and each model was then validated by using a test data set. The presence/absence and abundance of Common Eagle Rays and Bull Rays were mostly influenced by spatial (haul location) and temporal predictors. The major occurrences of Common Eagle Rays and Bull Rays were observed in the upper Adriatic Sea between late spring and early autumn. During winter, a southward shift in the catch was recorded for both species. In accordance with a significant effect of depth, Common Eagle Rays were more likely to be caught in hauls conducted between 10‐ and 60‐m depths. The CPUEs of Common Eagle Rays and Bull Rays declined significantly with haul duration and net vertical opening. The validation procedure indicated that the predictive accuracy of the models was rather good. Giving new insight into the ecological requirements of Common Eagle Rays and Bull Rays, the results of this study may contribute to the development of conservation strategies and can be used to direct future monitoring and research programs.

Lost and abandoned nets in deep-water gillnet fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic: retrieval exercises and outcomes. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 323–333. The methods used and the results, including estimates of ghost catches present at the time of retrieval, from Irish and UK (England and Wales) gillnet retrieval exercises carried out in deep-water gillnet fisheries west of the British Isles are described. Summaries of the exercises are currently found only in the grey literature, and there is a need to make them more widely available to the scientific community. The fisheries are currently principally for anglerfish (mainly Lophius piscatorius), along with a small bycatch of deep-water sharks [mainly leafscale gulper shark (Centrophorous squamosus) and Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis)]. The methods used and the results from retrieval exercises in the Norwegian Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossus) gillnet fishery are also presented. It is suggested that the efficiency of the Norwegian retrieval gear (which was used in all but one of the retrieval exercises described) be investigated under a range of conditions using an attached underwater camera. The outcomes from this could be used to improve the design of retrieval gear and future gillnet retrieval survey/mitigation exercises. Suggestions are made to improve the format and interpretation of results from future retrieval surveys and to enhance their value to fishery managers and stock assessment scientists. The importance of the continued need for structured gillnet retrieval exercises in deep-water gillnet fisheries is emphasized, and suggestions are made for conducting future studies.

AB  - A new whipray, Maculabatis ambigua sp. nov., described from material collected from the Red Sea and off Zanzibar (Tanzania), is probably more widespread in the northwestern Indian Ocean. It has been confused with other Indian Ocean whiprays of the genus Maculabatis (formerly Himantura in part) i.e. M. gerrardi and M. randalli. Maculabatis ambigua sp. nov. was first distinguished from these species by molecular analysis, and subsequently by a combination of morphological characters, i.e. disc shape, coloration, morphometrics and squamation. Molecular data suggest that it is most closely related to the morphologically similar M. gerrardi, which occurs further east in the Indian Ocean (Oman to Indonesia) and North-West Pacific (north to Taiwan). The dorsal disc of M. gerrardi typically has a full or partial coverage of white spots (usually present at least on the posterior disc), whereas M. ambigua sp. nov. is plain coloured. Maculabatis randalli, which occurs in the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, is plain coloured, but has a longer disc relative to its width, more acute and longer snout, longer head and larger intergill width, wider internasal distance, and a narrower secondary denticle band in adults. Maculabatis ambigua sp. nov. is relatively common in the shallow, soft-sedimentary habitats of the southern Red Sea from where it is taken as low-value or discarded bycatch of trawl fisheries. It is a medium-sized whipray with a maximum confirmed size of 840 mm disc width.

AB  - Commercial fisheries have dramatically impacted elasmobranch populations worldwide. With high capture and bycatch rates, the abundance of many species is rapidly declining and around a quarter of the world’s sharks and rays are threatened with extinction. At a regional scale this negative trend has also been evidenced in the central Mediterranean Sea, where bottom-trawl fisheries have affected the biomass of certain rays (e.g. Raja clavata) and sharks (e.g. Mustelus spp.). Detailed knowledge of elasmobranch habitat requirements is essential for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, but this is often hampered by a poor understanding of their spatial ecology. Habitat suitability models were used to investigate the habitat preference of nine elasmobranch species and their overall diversity (number of species) in relation to five environmental predictors (i.e. depth, sea surface temperature, surface salinity, slope and rugosity) in the central Mediterranean Sea. Results showed that depth, seafloor morphology and sea surface temperature were the main drivers for elasmobranch habitat suitability. Predictive distribution maps revealed different species-specific patterns of suitable habitat while high assemblage diversity was predicted in deeper offshore waters (400–800 m depth). This study helps to identify priority conservation areas and diversity hot-spots for rare and endangered elasmobranchs in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Sawfishes (Pristidae) were formerly abundant in the western Indian Ocean, but current data on sawfish presence and distribution are lacking for most of the region. This paper summarises historical records of sawfishes in Mozambican waters and presents the findings of the first assessment of the presence and status of sawfishes in Mozambique. A countrywide baseline assessment was undertaken between May and July 2014, using interviews with artisanal, semi-industrial and industrial fishers, fish traders and fisheries monitoring staff as the primary source of information on sawfish distribution, recent catches, socio-economic value and cultural importance. Additional interviews were conducted via email or telephone with individuals running sport fishing operations or who otherwise had considerable experience interacting with the fishing sectors or the marine environment in Mozambique. Where encountered, sawfish rostra were photographed and a series of measurements and associated data were collected. In total, 200 questionnaire surveys and seven interviews with recreational fishing and dive operators were conducted, and 19 rostra were documented from museum archives and private collections, belonging to two sawfish species, the Largetooth Sawfish (<i>Pristis pristis)</i> and Green Sawfish (<i>P. zijsron)</i>. The most recent captures of sawfishes were reported to have occurred in 2014. Two key sites were identified where both recent encounters were reported and numerous Largetooth Sawfish rostra were documented. Gill nets were the fishing gear most commonly attributed to sawfish catches. Sawfishes did not hold any cultural importance in Mozambique, but they have at least some socio-economic importance to artisanal fishers, primarily through the sale of their fins. The meat did not appear to be held in high regard and was usually consumed locally. Sampling and further research is now required to confirm the presence of sawfishes and to assess the primary threats to sawfishes in those areas. At one site where a number of rostra were present and where fishers stated that they still catch sawfish, gill nets are being provided to fishers as an alternative to beach seining. This may have a serious impact on the local sawfish population and more broadly for other elasmobranchs in the area. Immediate action is required to develop a landings monitoring programme in this and other key habitats, and to encourage fishers to release sawfishes alive.

AB  - Gillnets are size‐selective fishing gears commonly used by industrial and small‐scale fishers, so understanding selectivity can aid fisheries management by identifying suitable mesh sizes to optimize catches of target species while reducing bycatch. Few size selectivity parameters have been estimated for sharks, with even fewer for rays. Size selection parameters were estimated for seven species of sharks and two species of rays from the Queensland East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery (ECIFF). Size frequency data from a fishery observer program on ECIFF vessels was used to fit a standard size selection model. Mesh size independent parameters, θ1 and θ2, were estimated for each species to define selectivity curves for different mesh sizes for each species. Parameter values were compared with previous studies that used the same method. Estimates of θ1 were similar among species within the same genus, such as Carcharhinus, Rhizoprionodon, and Sphyrna. Anoxypristis cuspidata had the largest θ1 and θ2 values, likely because of its toothed rostrum that affected catchability in gillnets. Our findings can be used for the ECIFF and other gillnet fisheries to aid in mesh size recommendations and risk mitigation.

AB  - Management of large-scale tuna purse-seine fisheries often involves consideration of set type because the different set types yield different target species and bycatch species compositions, and may therefore impact those populations differently. Using the ensemble method random forests for classification, annual set type classification algorithms were developed based on a suite of operational characteristics, and catch and bycatch information, collected by onboard observers for the tropical tuna purse-seine fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) during 2010–2019. Two types of algorithms were built for each year: 1) a 2-class algorithm for sets on unassociated tuna schools (NOA) and sets on floating-object-associated tuna (OBJ); and, 2) a 3-class algorithm for all three types of sets that occur in the EPO, which includes sets on marine mammal-associated tuna (DEL). Results indicated that such data can be used to reliably distinguish between purse-seine sets types, highlighting inherent operational and ecological differences among them in the EPO. For the 2-class algorithms, the average misclassification error rates were 3.3% for NOA sets and 4.5% for OBJ sets. For the 3-class algorithms, the average misclassification error rates were 2% for DEL sets, 10.6% for NOA sets and 4.6% for OBJ sets. Comparison of results for NOA sets from the 2-class and 3-class algorithms suggests that the higher NOA-set misclassification error rate for the 3-class algorithm is due to a difficulty in distinguishing NOA sets from DEL sets with the predictors used in this analysis. The most useful bycatch information for predicting set type included amounts of dorado, wahoo, small fish species, such as triggerfishes, and silky sharks, illustrating the importance of bycatch data collection by observers, even for species of no commercial value. In the case of the 2-class algorithms, the annual misclassification error rates for NOA and OBJ sets were not only small, but also fairly stable over the 10-year period, even in the presence of the strong 2015 – 2016 El Niño event. This suggests that the methodology is robust and could be used to validate set type determinations based on other criteria, such as distance to a floating object (or a fish aggregating device), and to verify data quality, more generally.

AB  - In the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), which accounts for over half of world tuna production, purse seine effort and catch on floating objects have increased significantly due to a rapid increase in the use of fixed and free-floating fish aggregation devices (FADs). FAD fishing has had an impact on the current status of the stocks of the three main target tunas in the equatorial WCPO, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (T. obesus). FADs have been shown to influence the behaviour and movement patterns of the three tuna species with the juveniles of each species occupying shallower habitats when associated with FADs. Aggregation of tunas around drifting objects increases their vulnerability to purse seine gear, particularly for juvenile and small size classes. Further to the impacts on the target stocks, the use of FADs has increased the vulnerability of other fishes to the purse seine method, including some shark and billfish species. Given the concern over FAD-related fishing effort on target and bycatch species, there is a need to understand how FAD use affects target and bycatch stocks. Science needs to better support management decisions are highlighted including the need to identify the magnitude of broader community-level affects.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are increasingly implemented to facilitate the conservation of marine biodiversity and key habitats. However, these areas are often less effective to conserve mobile marine species like elasmobranchs (i.e., sharks and rays). Industrial fishing near MPA borders possibly impacts vulnerable species utilizing these protected areas. Hence, we aimed to study spatiotemporal patterns of industrial fisheries near MPAs, in relation to the bycatch of elasmobranchs. Specifically, we analyzed the spatiotemporal fishing effort within the West African region, mapped fishing effort in the direct vicinity of the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin (PNBA, Mauritania) and the Bijagós Archipelago (BA, Guinea Bissau), and compared the seasonal overlap between elasmobranch bycatch and fishing effort near these MPAs. We combined Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and local fisheries observer data, and determined fishing effort for each gear type and compared this with bycatch of elasmobranchs. We found that industrial fishing effort was dominated by trawling, drifting longlines, and fixed gear types. Although no industrial fishing was observed within both MPAs, 72 and 78% of the buffer zones surrounding the MPAs were fished for the Banc d’Arguin and Bijagós, respectively. Within the Banc d’Arguin buffer zone, trawling and drifting longlines dominated, with longlines mainly being deployed in fall. In the Bijagós buffer zone, trawling and fixed gears were most prevalent. Fisheries observer data for Mauritania showed that elasmobranch catches increased during the most recent sampling years (2016–2018). Elasmobranch catches within the waters of Guinea Bissau peaked in 2016 and decreased in the following two years. Seasonal patterns in elasmobranch bycatch within the waters of both countries are likely caused by increased catches of migratory species. Catches of rays peaked in May and June for Mauritania, and in October for Guinea Bissau. Shark catches were highest in February and July in Mauritanian waters, and in May and October in the waters of Guinea Bissau. Our study indicates that industrial fisheries near the border of ecologically important MPAs may have potentially major implications for ecosystem functioning by the removal of (migratory) predatory species.

AB  - This research focuses on the description of the spatial and temporal distributions of mobulid ray species (Mobula birostris, Mobula mobular, Mobula thurstoni, Mobula tarapacana and Mobula munkiana) using data from the observer program (1993–2014) of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). The tuna purse seine operations in the region extend from 70 to 150°W to 20°S-30°N. Significant differences on the captures per sets between fishing modes and species were found. Results showed that the most common species taken are M. thurstoni, M. mobular and M. birostris in School sets (sets on unassociated tuna schools). The temporal distributions showed high variability of the catches by species and years. The spatial distribution showed several areas of importance depending of the type of fishing, such as the coast of Peru, Galagapos or the Costa Rica Dome, and possible relationships with some oceanographic processes of the eastern Pacific Ocean (i.e. coastal and seasonal upwelling systems). The frequency of the captures per set showed that, although the greatest numbers caught in a set were very low (around 53.7% of sets with one capture), in some areas and periods there were captures of aggregates of hundreds of individuals of some of these species, such as Galapagos Islands during December, Costa Rica Dome during August, or Baja California during June. These events are of biological interest, and may offer good opportunities for conservation. This project has been developed with the aim of identifying the most important areas for these bycatch species and thus, improving the knowledge on them to reduce their mortality.

AB  - In the eastern Pacific Ocean, the tropical tuna purse-seine fishery incidentally captures high numbers of five mobulid bycatch species; all of which are classified as mortalities by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission due to uncertainties in post-release mortality rates. To date, the factors (operational or environmental) leading to the capture of these species by the fishery have not been well studied. Here, we developed Generalized Additive Models for fisheries observer data to analyze the relationships between the presence/absence of Mobula mobular bycatch and oceanographic conditions, the spatial and temporal variability in fishing location, and the set type (associated with dolphins, free-swimming tuna schools or floating objects). Our results suggest that chlorophyll concentration and sea surface height are the most important variables to describe the presence of M. mobular in conjunction with geographic location (latitude and longitude) and set type. Presence of the species was predicted in waters with chlorophyll concentrations between 0.5-1 mg·m-3 and with sea surface height values close to 0; which indicates direct relationships with productive upwelling systems. Seasonally, M. mobular was observed more frequently during December-January and August-September. We also found the highest probability of presence observed in School sets, followed by Dolphin sets. Three areas were observed as important hotspots: the area close to the coastal upwelling of northern Peru, the area west to Islands Colon Archipelago (Galapagos) and the area close to the Costa Rica Dome. This information is crucial to identify the mobulids habitat and hotspots that could be managed and protected under dynamic spatial management measures to reduce the mortality of mobulid rays in the eastern Pacific purse-seine fishery and, hence, ensure the sustainability of the populations of these iconic species.

AB  - To protect the most vulnerable marine species it is essential to have an understanding of their spatiotemporal distributions. In recent decades, Bayesian statistics have been successfully used to quantify uncertainty surrounding identified areas of interest for bycatch species. However, conventional simulation-based approaches are often computationally intensive. To address this issue, in this study, an alternative Bayesian approach (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation with Stochastic Partial Differential Equation, INLA-SPDE) is used to predict the occurrence of Mobula mobular species in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). Specifically, a Generalized Additive Model is implemented to analyze data from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission’s (IATTC) tropical tuna purse-seine fishery observer bycatch database (2005–2015). The INLA-SPDE approach had the potential to predict both the areas of importance in the EPO, that are already known for this species, and the more marginal hotspots, such as the Gulf of California and the Equatorial area which are not identified using other habitat models. Some drawbacks were identified with the INLA-SPDE database, including the difficulties of dealing with categorical variables and triangulating effectively to analyze spatial data. Despite these challenges, we conclude that INLA approach method is an useful complementary and/or alternative approach to traditional ones when modeling bycatch data to inform accurately management decisions.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment (ERA) has been applied on assessing the relative risk of bycatch species in recent years. ERA index is calculated by productivity of species and susceptibility of fisheries on fish species. In this study, a semi-quantitative method was used to evaluate the risks of exploitation for 20 pelagic fish species by the small-scale longline fisheries in the western North Pacific Ocean. The productivity was estimated based on the ranking (high, median, and low) of seven life history parameters. The susceptibility was calculated by the multiplication of the catchability, selectivity and post-capture mortality. The ERA results indicated the risks of sharks are higher than those of tunas and billfishes, except yellowfin tuna (<i>Thunnus albacares</i>). The shortfin mako shark (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>) and dusky shark (<i>Carcharhinus obscurus</i>) have the highest risk. Other shark species, yellowfin tuna, and sailfish (<i>Istiophorus platypterus</i>) have medium risk. While the striped marlin (<i>Kajikia audax</i>), and albacore tuna (<i>T. alalunga</i>) have the lowest risk. Stock assessment and rigorous management measures such as catch quota and size limit are recommended for the species in high or medium ecological risk and a consistent monitoring management scheme is suggested for those in low ecological risk.

AB  - The Shortfin Mako Isurus oxyrinchus is one of the major shark bycatch species in the longline fishery for tuna Thunnus spp. in the Indian Ocean; however, its biological information is still little known. This study estimated the age and growth of Shortfin Makos in the southern Indian Ocean. In total, 178 specimens (72 females and 106 males) were opportunistically collected by the scientific observers onboard Taiwanese large‐scale longline fishing vessels from February 2013 to September 2016 in the southern Indian Ocean. The relationship of gutted weight (GW; in kg) to curved fork length (CFL; in cm) for both sexes combined was estimated as GW = 0.00001 × CFL2.517 (n = 170, r2 = 0.85). Growth band pairs (including translucent and opaque bands) were counted based on sectioned vertebral centra from the caudal peduncle region. The periodicity of band‐pair deposition on vertebral centra was estimated to be 1 year, with opaque bands deposited around August based on edge analysis. On this basis, the maximum observed ages of females and males were 18 and 14 years, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth function best fitted the observed sexes‐combined length‐at‐age data, with growth parameter estimates as L∞ = 267.6 cm CFL, k = 0.123/year, and t0 = −2.487 years (n = 159). The growth model could be improved for future stock assessments by increasing the sample size, particularly on very small (neonates and small subadults) and very large female Shortfin Makos.

AB  - Marine animals including turtles, sharks, and dolphins are bycaught at an alarming rate worldwide, although the extent of this bycatch is rarely quantified. Here, we assess the frequencies of turtle, shark, and dolphin bycatch by fisheries operating artisanal and semi-industrial boats in the Island of Maio, Cape Verde. Among all interviews (n139), fishers reported higher shark bycatch (71) than turtle (32) and dolphin (9) bycatch. However, we found no difference in turtle bycatch between artisanal and semi-industrial fishers. Artisanal fishers and semi-industrial fishers caught mostly loggerhead turtle (76, 48) followed by the green turtle (6, 38). We need further studies that specifically target bycatch and the type of gear used by fishers and verify whether the reported frequencies correspond to actual bycatch rates.

AB  - Oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is an important top predator in pelagic ecosystems currently classified as globally Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. This species is incidentally caught by fisheries targeting highly migratory tunas and billfishes throughout the Indian Ocean. Understanding the temporal, spatial and environmental factors influencing the capture of this species is essential to reduce incidental catches. In this study, we used generalized additive models to analyze the spatio-temporal distributions of the juvenile oceanic whitetip shark catches and the environmental conditions in the western Indian Ocean using observer data from 2010 to 2020 of the European Union and associated flags purse seine fishery. We found sea surface temperature and nitrate concentration to be the most important environmental variables predicting the probability of catching an oceanic whitetip shark. A higher probability of capture was predicted in areas where sea surface temperature was below 24°C and with low nitrate concentrations close to zero and intermediate values (1.5-2.5 mmol.m-3). We also found a higher probability of capture in sets on fish aggregating devices than in sets on free schools of tuna. The Kenya and Somalia basin was identified to have higher probabilities of capture during the summer monsoon (June to September) when upwelling of deep cold waters occurs. We provide the first prediction maps of capture probabilities and insights into the environmental preferences of oceanic whitetip shark in the western Indian Ocean. However, the causal mechanisms behind these insights should be explored in future studies before they can be used to design spatial management and conservation strategies, such as time-area closures, for bycatch avoidance.

AB  - The western Mediterranean is an important fishing area in which the Spanish longline fleet operates. Longline fisheries affect several species of marine mammals, sea turtles, sharks and seabirds, all of which are especially sensitive to fishing mortality. Given international efforts to identify and reduce the bycatch of sensitive species, an onboard observer program was implemented by the Spanish Oceanographic Institute (IEO, Instituto Español de Oceanografía). The aim of the present study was to report data on marine mammal bycatch in the western Mediterranean. The additional aim was to improve knowledge about the possible effects of the Spanish longline fisheries on cetacean populations, particularly Risso’s dolphin, and to suggest improvements to fisheries management. Data on marine mammal bycatch were collected during the period 2000–2009. Differences are reported for catch per unit effort (CPUE, defined as marine mammals per 1000 hooks) for each type of gear (n = 7), as well as their effect on specific marine mammal species. A total of 5 398 297 hooks were monitored, which yielded 56 marine mammals belonging to 4 different species. Our results indicate that Risso’s dolphin is the species most affected by the longline fishery in the western Mediterranean (n = 33). We built a predictive model for Risso’s dolphin bycatch using variables associated with the technical characteristics of the fishery, geographic location and seasonality. We performed a binary logistic regression of the presence/absence of Risso’s dolphin bycatch to test whether the probability of incidentally catching one or more dolphins may be predicted by some of the explanatory variables selected. Our results indicate that Risso’s dolphin was mainly caught using Japanese longline (LLJAP) or an experimental home-based longline (LLHBexp) over the continental shelf. Because LLHBexp is an experimental type of gear that was only used occasionally by the fleet, controlling the use of LLJAP over the continental shelf could strongly reduce the impact of these fisheries on populations of Risso’s dolphin in the western Mediterranean.

AB  - Investigating the relationship between species and environmental conditions is key for the correct management of highly migratory large pelagic species like silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis). This species is currently ranked as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the population trend may be decreasing globally. Tuna fisheries annually catch around 5 million tons worldwide but may have effects on the ecosystem, including impacts on certain sensitive non-target species. We provide the first insights into the environmental preferences of silky shark in the Atlantic Ocean by modelling their presence from tropical tuna purse seine observer data (~ 7500 fishing sets between 2003 and 2015) with a set of biotic and abiotic oceanographic factors, spatial–temporal terms and fishing operation variables. Oceanographic data (sea surface temperature, sea surface temperature change, salinity, sea surface height, chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-a change, oxygen, and current information such as speed, direction and eddy kinetic energy) were downloaded and processed from the EU Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. Results provide information on the hotspots dynamics of silky shark as well as its habitat preferences. Models detected a significant relationship between seasonal upwelling events, mesoscale features and silky shark presence and suggested strong interaction between productive systems and the spatial–temporal distribution of the species. The model also highlighted both persistent (i.e. Gabon) and temporary areas (i.e. Guinea and southern-central tropical Atlantic Ocean) for silky shark in the region. This information could be used to assist tuna regional fisheries management organizations in the conservation and management of this vulnerable non-target species.

AB  - Marine megafauna are critical for marine ecosystem health and their removal can cause food webs to collapse. Methods to reduce marine megafauna mortality can result in conflict between scientists, conservationists, fishers and fisheries management due to real or perceived effects on target catch, income and food security. Sensory deterrents have been used in attempts to mitigate bycatch and retain target catch quantity and quality. Here, we completed a systematic review of 116 papers, plus 25 literature reviews published between 1991 and 2022, to investigate potential for sensory deterrents to mitigate bycatch across four marine megafauna taxonomic groups (marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds and elasmobranchs). Lights on gillnets are the only technology so far to result in significant bycatch reductions across all four taxonomic groups. It is difficult to make generalisations about the efficacy of sensory deterrents and their ability to deliver consistent bycatch reductions. The efficacy of each method is context dependent, varying with species, fishery and environmental characteristics. Further research is recommended for field studies assessing bycatch mitigation in all sensory deterrents, including combinations of deterrents, to assess effects on target and non-target species. The associated issues of habituation, habitat exclusion and foraging around fishing gear are important, although reducing mortality of vulnerable species should remain the highest priority for conservation and preserving ecosystems that fishers depend on. Multiple complementary measures will be required to achieve consistent bycatch reduction targets in many fisheries, of which sensory deterrents could play some part if implemented appropriately.

AB  - Large pelagic sharks are distributed throughout all of the oceans and are caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries worldwide. In the southern Atlantic Ocean, more than a dozen shark species are caught by the Brazilian tuna longline fleet. This study compiles information of the main shark species caught by the Brazilian tuna longline fishery in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Catch and effort data of 14,860 longline sets from the Brazilian chartered tuna longline fleet, between 2004 and 2010, were analyzed. The blue shark Prionace glauca was the main shark species captured by this fishery. Shark catches showed contrasting trends during the study period: the silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) and the oceanic whitetip (C. longimanus) sharks catch increased up to 2008 and then declined, while mako sharks (Isurus spp.) showed an opposite trend. Effort for the Brazilian longline fishery had a higher concentration from 10°N to 30°S and from 20°W to 40°W. High values of catch per unit effort of southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean sharks were heterogeneously distributed and, although elasmobranchs were caught over most of the longline fishing range, only blue sharks were caught in all areas. In the southern Atlantic Ocean, high fishing effort zones overlap significantly with some nursery areas, especially for the oceanic whitetip shark, indicating that these areas are at a direct risk from the industrial longline fishery.

AB  - Relative abundance trends of highly migratory species (HMS) have played a central role in debates over the health of global fisheries. However, such trends have mostly been inferred from fishery catch rates, which can provide misleading signals of relative abundance. While many biases are accounted for through traditional catch rate standardization, pelagic habitat fished is rarely directly considered. Using a method that explicitly accounts for temperature regimes, we analysed data from the US pelagic longline fishery to estimate relative abundance trends for 34 HMS in the Atlantic Ocean from 1987 through 2013. This represents one of the largest studies of HMS abundance trends. Model selection emphasized the importance of accounting for pelagic habitat fished with water column temperature being included in nearly every species’ model, and in extreme cases, a temperature variable explained 50–60% of the total deviance. Our estimated trends represent observations from one fishery only, and a more integrated stock assessment should form the basis for conclusions about stock status overall. Nonetheless, our trends serve as indicators of stock abundance and they suggest that a majority of HMS (71% of analysed species) are either declining in relative abundance or declined initially with no evidence of rebuilding. Conversely, 29% of the species exhibited stable, increasing, or recovering trends; however, these trends were more prevalent among tunas than either billfishes or sharks. By estimating the effects of pelagic habitat on fishery catch rates, our results can be used in combination with ocean temperature trends and forecasts to support bycatch avoidance and other time-area management decisions.

AB  - Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides are bottom-dwelling flatfish that support commercial and community fisheries in Baffin Bay, Canada. Recently, exploratory inshore summer fisheries have raised concerns surrounding the bycatch of Greenland sharks Somniosus microcephalus and Arctic skate Amblyraja hyperborea , which are susceptible to overfishing due to their conservative life history traits. To explore fisheries selectivity and opportunities for bycatch mitigation, we combined pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and fisheries data to assess habitat overlap and catch trends across these 3 species. PSAT data showed variable inter-specific overlap, with Greenland sharks primarily inhabiting depths <1000 m (725 ± 193 m), Greenland halibut inhabiting a narrower depth range (1030 ± 113 m), and Arctic skates overlapping depths (950 ± 225 m) of both species. However, fisheries data suggested high inter-specific overlap at deepest depths, with peak catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of all species at depths 800-1000 m. A marked decline in Greenland shark CPUE was observed throughout the fishing season which was best explained by cumulative fishing pressure. Combined tagging and fisheries data suggest that targeting specific seasonal habitat will not decrease bycatch, and inshore summer longline fisheries should be evaluated in the context of potentially high elasmobranch mortality, with enforced bycatch handling practices and alternative mitigation measures (e.g. gear modification or reduced soak times) required.

AB  - The shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, is caught in the eastern North Atlantic as a regular bycatch of the surface-drift longline fishery, mainly directed towards swordfish, Xiphias gladius. Stomachs of 112 shortfin mako sharks, ranging in size from 64 cm to 290 cm fork length, showed teleosts to be the principal component of the diet, occurring in 87% of the stomachs and accounting for over 90% of the contents by weight. Crustaceans and cephalopods were also relatively important in this species’ diet, whereas other elasmobranchs were only present in lower percentages. Meal overlap was observed in half of the sampled sharks. No clear trend of prey size selectivity was found, despite smaller individuals seeming incapable of pursuing larger and faster prey. The retention of small prey was also observed in the diet of all sizes of shark. Seasonality in food habits was in accordance with the current availability of food items. The observed vacuity index of 12% is comparable to foraging ecology studies using gillnetting and appears not to be influenced by baited longline gear. Morphological relationships of the digestive system might add important information to the foraging ecology studies and to ecosystem modelling.

AB  - The non-target bycatch of sharks in pelagic longline (PLL) fisheries represents a potential source of compromise to shark populations worldwide. Moreover, shark bycatch and depredation (damage inflicted on gear, bait, and catch) complicates management of sharks and other species, and can undermine the operations and financial interests of the pelagic longline industry. Thus, deducing means to reduce shark interactions is in the best interest of multiple stakeholder groups. Prior to doing so, however, the extent, cause and effect of these interactions must be better understood. In this review we address or conduct the following in relation to the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean PLL fishery: (1) U.S. management governing shark interactions in the Atlantic; (2) the primary species encountered and historical shark catch data associated with PLL fishing in the Atlantic; (3) a historical comparison of area-specific shark species catch records between the two primary sources of shark catch data in this fishery; (4) the conditions and dynamics that dictate shark interactions in this fishery, and potential means to reduce these interactions, and; (5) a synthesis of the estimated impacts of this fishery on shark populations relative to other fisheries in the Atlantic. As has been found in other PLL fisheries, the blue shark (Prionace glauca) is clearly the shark species most commonly encountered in this fishery in the Atlantic, and receives the majority of attention in this review. U.S. management areas with high relative shark species diversities had a greater divergence in historical shark species percent-compositions between data sources (Pelagic Observer Program versus mandatory pelagic Logbook databases); this complicates the ability to conclude which species are most impacted by PLL fishing in those areas. The current fishing effort by the U.S. PLL fleet is small compared to that of PLL fishing targeting sharks in the Atlantic by non-U.S. fleets, and therefore poses a comparatively lower threat to the stability of Atlantic shark populations. However, incidental shark encounters are inevitable in U.S. Atlantic PLL fishing operations. Thus, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders in the Atlantic to better understand the extent and conditions governing these interactions, and to explore methods to reduce both their occurrence and those aspects leading to higher rates of incidental shark mortality.

AB  - To estimate the short-term bycatch discard mortality of otter trawl captured spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), individuals caught by a Northwest Atlantic commercial bottom-trawl vessel using 45–60min tows were held in held in pens for 72-h trials in lieu of being released. Mortality rates were compared to those in minimally stressed hook-and-line (control) dogfish subjected to the same protocols. To interpret physiological consequences of trawl capture, blood acid–base parameters were also assessed in dogfish following capture by both trawling and the hook-and-line control. Whole-blood pH (significantly depressed), pCO2 (significantly elevated) and pO2 (significantly depressed) were all markedly disturbed in trawled dogfish, indicating that trawl capture elicited a far greater disruption to vascular acid–base balance. However, 72h mortality was not negligible for control dogfish (24%) but similar to trawling (29%), indicating that pens likely caused the observed (72h) mortality associated with both capture methods. Still, in evaluating the range of 72h trawling mortalities found across pen trials, estimated tow-weight was a significant predictor of mortality, explaining 67% of the variation. This suggests that penning stress was merely an additive factor compounding initial capture stress that dictated the 72h mortality of trawled individuals. When normalized by subtracting out hook-and-line pen mortality, 72h trawling mortality generally remained well below the 50.0% spiny dogfish discard mortality rate currently estimated for trawling in the Northwest Atlantic and was even superceded by penning stress in lighter tows; a testament to the resiliency of this species. However, catch-weights exceeding 200kg yielded rapid elevations in 72h mortality that more closely approached current estimates. This intimates that as tows become more heavily packed, potentially fatal damage inflicted on this species can heighten quickly. Spiny dogfish discard mortality is thus postulated as more commensurate with current estimations for otter trawling when tows are heavily packed.

AB  - Fisheries observer programs represent the most reliable way to collect data on fisheries bycatch. However, their limited coverage leads to important data gaps that preclude bycatch mitigation at the basin scale. Habitat models developed from available fisheries observer programs offer a potential solution to fill these gaps. We focus on tropical tuna purse seine fisheries (TTPSF) that span across the tropics and extensively rely on floating objects (FOBs) for catching tuna schools, leading to the bycatch of other species associated with these objects. Bycatch under floating objects is dominated by five species, including the vulnerable silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis and four bony fishes (oceanic triggerfish Canthidermis maculata, rainbow runner Elagatis bipinnulata, wahoo Acanthocybium solandri, and dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus). Our objective was to predict possible bycatch hotspots associated with FOBs for these five species across two tropical oceans. We used bycatch data collected from observer programs onboard purse seiners in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. We developed a generalized additive model per species and per ocean relating bycatch to a set of environmental covariates (depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, surface salinity, total kinetic energy and the density of floating objects) and temporal covariates (year and month). We extrapolated modeled relationships across each ocean within the range of environmental covariates associated with the bycatch data and derived quarterly predictions. We then detected bycatch hotspots as the 90th percentiles of predictions. In the Atlantic Ocean, bycatch hotspots were predicted throughout tropical and subtropical waters with little overlap between species. By contrast in the Indian Ocean, major overlapping hotspots were predicted in the Arabian Sea throughout most of the year for four species, including the silky shark. Our modeling approach provides a new analytical way to fill data gaps in fisheries bycatch. Even with the lack of evaluation inherent to extrapolations, our modeling effort represents the first step to assist bycatch mitigation in TTPSF and is applicable beyond these fisheries.

AB  - An analysis is made of the catch, effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the incidental capture of billfish and other species by longline vessels in eastern Venezuela. The information was based on fishing logbooks from 1986 to 2000. The fishing grounds were divided into two sectors according to the different hydrological regimes: the Caribbean Sea (11º–17ºN, 61º–75W) and the western Atlantic Ocean (5º–17ºN, 50º–60ºW). The number of vessels in the fleet increased from 9 to 41 units between 1986 and 1996. Tunas were the dominant group in the landings, representing on average 73.2% in the Caribbean Sea and 78.8% in the Atlantic Ocean. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) was the most important species, accounting for 67.4% and 56% of the total weight captured in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, respectively. The incidental catch was composed of white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), sail fish (Istiophorus albicans), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), sword fish (Xiphias gladius), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), and sharks (mainly Carcharhinus spp. and Isurus spp.). White marlin and blue marlin presented asimilar pattern of variation and a sustained decrease in average yearly CPUE during the study period. For both species, CPUE seasonality was strong and more evident in the Caribbean, with a minimum in June and August. Blue marlin showed the highest yields per unit of effort (1.7 kg/100 hooks/day) in both sectors; dolphinfish showed similar CPUE values in both sectors, while the yields of sword fish were higher in the Caribbean Sea and those of sharks were higher in the Atlantic Ocean. The average annual CPUE of white marlin and several shark species showed significant differences between the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean sectors. The changes in abundance of the species seem to be associated with feeding migratory movements.

AB  - Sharks is the dominant bycatch of purse seine and bottom longline vessels that landed in Kutaraja ocean fishing port, particularly pelagic thresher shark species (Alopias pelagicus). The management of shark fisheries  in Aceh water is not well implemented.  According to the IUCN red list, the pelagic thresher shark has been classified as an endangered species. The capture and trade of pelagic thresher sharks are regulated by CITES (Appendix II). So that Indonesia has to comply with the procedures of CITES due to it has been adopted through the Decree of Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of the Republic of Indonesia Number 61/PERMEN-KP/2018. However, the exploitation and trading of the A. pelagicus continues and is not properly managed. It will threaten the extinction of the pelagic thresher shark population and in terms of a negative image of fisheries management in Indonesia, in particular.  Thus, integrated management such as the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) is needed to solve this problem. This study aims to evaluate the fisheries management status of the pelagic thresher shark based on EAFM indicator of fish resources domain, focusing in the Kutaraja ocean fishing port. This research was conducted by field measurement and interviews with key stakeholders. Data were analyzed using a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approach through development of a composite index. The results showed that the trend of CPUE  tends to fluctuate in the last 5 years. The total length of the sharks was relatively constant. The proportion of juvenile pelagic thresher sharks was 16% male, and 28% (female), and the shark was bycatch (1%) of the purse seine fishery, the fishing ground was getting further away and seemed to go close to the shark habitat.  Based on this assessment, one could conclude that shark's fishery resources were in 'good' category, however, some indicators need to improve through better fisheries management actions. Keywords: EAFM; Alopias pelagicus; pelagic thresher shark; Kutaraja ocean fishing port

AB  - This paper describes the composition of the harvest by species of two vessels operating with two different pelagic longline systems aimed at swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Four zones were surveyed in the Uruguayan EEZ and international waters in the south-western Atlantic. Data were collected by observers on board who recorded the number of individuals in each of the species caught. In all, 50 species were caught, of which 15 were cartilaginous fish, 27 were teleosts and eight were ‘non- fish’ species (birds, mammals and turtles). The most abundant species were blue shark (Prionace glauca) (43%), swordfish (27%) and albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) (9%). The abundances of blue shark and of swordfish differed significantly between the two rigging systems and among the four zones. The catch was classified into three marketing groups: primary marketing (swordfish and high-price tuna), secondary marketing (non-target species but marketable) and discards (with no commercial value). In terms of numbers, the first two groups represented between 91% and 72% of the species collected. This percentage may vary if the catch is analysed by weight, as only part of the carcass and shark fins are used. Resumen. Se describe la composición por especies de la captura de dos buques que operaron con dos sistemas diferentes de palangre pelágico dirijido a la extracción de pez espada (Xiphias gladius). Se relevaron quatros áreas que abarcaron la ZEE uruguaya y aguas internacionales en el O. Atlántico. Los datos fueron colectados a bordo por observadores, registrando la captura en número de la totalidad de las especies. Se contabilizó un total de 50 especies capturadas, de las cuales 15 corresponden a peces cartilaginosos, 27 a peces óseos y 8 a ‘non-pisces’ (aves, mamíferos y quelonios). Las especies más representadas fueron el tiburón azul (Prionace glauca) (43%), seguida por pez espada (27%) y albacora (Thunnus alalunga) (9,0%). La presencia de tiburón azul y pez espada mostró diferencias significativas comparando los dos sistemas de construcción del palangre y las zonas. Se clasificó la captura en tres grupos de comercialización: comercialización primaria (pez espada y atunes de elevado valor), comercialización secundaria (especies diferentes de la objetivo pero comercializables), y decarte (sin valor comercial). Las dos primeras acumularon entre el 91% y 72% de las piezas capturadas. Este porcentaje puede variar si se analiza la captura en peso, ya que de los tiburones se aprovechan las aletas y solamente parte de las carcasas.

AB  - Guitarfishes are a primary component of artisanal elasmobranch fisheries and are commonly taken as trawl fishery bycatch throughout the Gulf of California. However, little is known of the life history of this species. To address this lack of critical biological information, the reproductive biology of Rhinobatos productus was investigated in the eastern Gulf of California. Development of claspers and testes indicated that males reach maturity at 53 cm total length (TL). Measurements of oviducal gland, largest ovum diameter, and uterus width indicated that females >57 cm TL are mature. This species possesses two functional ovaries: the ovarian cycle and gestation run concurrently. Histological analysis of oviducal glands did not provide evidence of sperm storage, but females carrying uterine capsules were observed over an extended period, suggesting the possibility of diapause in the early embryonic development. Following 4–5 months of embryonic growth, pups were typically born from late June to October after a gestation period of approximately 11–12 months. Width of yolk sac was inversely related to embryo length. The rate of reduction of yolk sac width suggests that embryos depend on the sac until birth. Mean fecundity was estimated to be 5 (range 1–10, s.d. = 2.24) with a 1:1 sex ratio. Average size at birth was 175 mm TL. Seasonally, gravid females enter shallow waters for parturition, becoming extremely vulnerable to gill nets used in the artisanal ray fishery.

AB  - Since the mid 1990’s, stock assessments of shark populations in the northwest Atlantic by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have indicated that sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and dusky (C. obscurus) populations are overfished. In response to these assessments, the dusky shark bottom longline fishery was closed in 2000, followed by the sandbar fishery in 2005. A common management strategy is to mandate the release of prohibited species if caught as bycatch. However, a major assumption is that most released sharks survive, which may not be the case. Longline operations were conducted during 2011 and 2012 to capture and tag sandbar and dusky sharks, in order to assess (1) at-vessel mortality, (2) post-release mortality, and (3) investigate the effects of soak-time on each of these variables for each species. Our findings show that dusky sharks experience high at-vessel and post-release mortality, with mortality occurring more frequently after 3–5h on the line. While time-on-the-line (TOL) increased dusky shark at-vessel (16% when less than 3h TOL; 27.5% when more than 3h TOL) and post-release mortality (11% when less than 3h TOL; 42% when more than 3h TOL), sandbar shark at-vessel mortality was low (0% when less than 3h TOL). Nonetheless, the apparently hardier sandbar sharks did exhibit 29% post-release mortality after 3h TOL. The total mortality (at-vessel+post-release, including moribund individuals) for dusky sharks was 97% after being captured on a demersal longline when TOL surpassed 3h. These data clearly elucidate an interspecific difference in vulnerability to longline gear between these species.

AB  - The reproductive cycle of Trygonorrhina fasciata females in south-western Australian waters is shown to include a protracted period of embryonic diapause or delayed development. This characteristic is typically regarded as enabling young to be born when conditions are optimal. The birth of T. fasciata occurs in April/May, when water temperatures are still high and conducive to rapid growth. Furthermore, because gut fullness in this and subsequent months was similar to other times of the year, the prey of neonates, i.e. mysids, carids, pinnotherids, amphipods and isopods, were presumably abundant in that period. Ovulation occurs in April/May and embryos grow rapidly between December and birth in April/May. Females grew to greater lengths than males, i.e. 1460 v. 890 mm, and matured (L50) at larger lengths, i.e. 892 v. 678 mm respectively. As body size increased, teleosts, pilumnid and portunid crabs and molluscs became important dietary components. Overall, the diet consisted predominantly of crustaceans, fish, polychaetes and molluscs, with volumetric contributions of 73.4, 17.2, 5.3 and 2.8% respectively. Dietary composition underwent a cyclical seasonal change and differed among locations, indicating some degree of opportunistic feeding. Interspecific comparisons indicate that benthic food resources are partitioned among and within the main batoid species in south-western Australian waters.

AB  - Fisheries management interventions that protect certain species by redistributing fishing effort may generate unintended consequences for other species. In the California drift gillnet fishery for swordfish and sharks, a large spatial closure was implemented in 2001 to protect endangered leatherback turtles, which limited fishing effort to the Southern California Bight. Leatherback bycatch has since decreased, but the effects on other species have not been comprehensively examined. Here, we explore the effects of this closure on the community catch composition in the fishery and find that other protected species may have benefited, while catch per unit effort of major target species increased or was not significantly affected over the long term. However, a time-series analysis reveals that changes in catch trends across twenty species began at least five years before the closure was implemented, suggesting that previous regulatory measures or other drivers may also contribute to these trends. These results highlight the importance of comprehensive approaches that include the historical context when evaluating management outcomes.

AB  - Elasmobranchs make up a significant part of bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, whose induced mortality can be a major threat to endangered species. It is therefore crucial to understand the drivers of at-vessel mortality (AVM) for this fishing gear to enhance postrelease survival. To this end, we analysed scientific data collected during monitored longline fishing experiments conducted in French Polynesia to ( i) estimate AVM for each species based on bootstrapped samples and ( ii) to assess AVM drivers using multivariate logistic regression models for the blue shark ( Prionace glauca) and oceanic whitetip shark ( Carcharhinus longimanus). We found that AVM varies widely between species. Oceanic whitetip sharks are more likely to die when caught in waters outside their comfort temperature range, and their odds of survival increase with body length. For the blue shark, the only driver related to AVM is hooking duration. These results indicate that to reduce the AVM of these two species, the vertical distribution of hooks and soak duration should be considered as mitigation measures related to pelagic longlining.

AB  - We used research trawl survey data to describe the small-scale distribution and spatial continuity of orange roughy catch rates around the Northwest Hills complex of seamount features on the Chatham Rise to the east of New Zealand. Analyses revealed three distinct spatial patterns. The larger scale spatial structure in the catch rates was defined by the contours running east–west along the Chatham Rise. Orange roughy were caught in a depth band between 850 and 1200m, a depth distribution that is well known. Superimposed on this larger scale structure was a north–south trend in the highest catch rates at 180∘ longitude. This was created by higher catch rates on the seamounts. There were large differences in catch rates at small separation distances due to the seamount effect. However, not all the high catches were associated with seamounts, some being taken on the ‘flat’ areas around the hills. At distances away from the seamounts greater than the decorrelation length scale the spatial distributions of orange roughy catch rates were not random, and did not conform to a Poisson process used to characterise random distributions. Data visualisation of the spatial distributions of orange roughy and groups of bycatch revealed strong patchiness and spatial separation by depth of swimbladder fish, elasmobranchs and squid and oreos. This has important implications for acoustic surveys. Orange roughy overlapped most closely with swimbladder fish distributions, suggesting they may be obscured by species with higher acoustic target strengths. The observed separation of acoustically distinct fish groups by depth makes ground-truthing of acoustic backscatter easier. However, patchiness complicates prediction of where the acoustically distinct fish groups will occur. We conclude that extensive trawling provides a necessary complement to acoustic survey in order to estimate the biomass of orange roughy.

AB  - Sharks comprise a large portion of unwanted bycatch in longline fisheries worldwide and various technologies have been proposed to reduce elasmobranch bycatch without impacting the catch of target species. Recently, the naturally electrogenic lanthanide metals have been introduced as an elasmobranch-specific repellent. We quantified the voltage produced by six lanthanide metals in seawater, compared their dissolution rates, and performed a behavioral assay to determine their efficacy against two coastal shark species. We found that there was no difference in the voltage produced by the six tested metals and the voltage decayed as a power function (approximately x−1.5) with distance from the metal sample. We calculated that sharks should detect a sample of neodymium from a distance of 65–85cm in seawater. Voltage was greatest in freshwater and decreased logarithmically with increasing salinity but did not differ above salinities greater than 10ppt. The dissolution rate for the lanthanides varied from −1.6 to −0.2gh−1 and as the metals dissolved, the voltage remained constant. In a behavioral assay, neodymium was ineffective at repelling bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) tested individually and in groups, and juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) in groups.

AB  - Tropical tuna fisheries are among the largest worldwide, with some having significant bycatch issues. However, pole-and-line tuna fisheries are widely believed to have low bycatch rates, although these have rarely been quantified. The Maldives has an important pole-and-line fishery, targeting skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). In the Maldives, 106 pole-and-line tuna fishing days were observed between August 2014 and November 2015. During 161 fishing events, tuna catches amounted to 147 t: 72% by weight was skipjack, 25% yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and 3% other tunas. Bycatch (all non-tuna species caught plus all tuna discards) amounted to 951 kg (0.65% of total tuna catch). Most of the bycatch (95%) was utilized, and some bycatch was released alive, so dead discards were particularly low (0.02% of total tuna catch, or 22 kg per 100 t). Rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) together constituted 93% of the bycatch. Live releases included small numbers of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) and seabirds (noddies, Anous tenuirostris and A. stolidus). Pole-and-line tuna fishing was conducted on free schools and schools associated with various objects (Maldivian anchored fish aggregating devices [aFADs], drifting FADs from western Indian Ocean purse seine fisheries, other drifting objects and seamounts). Free school catches typically included a high proportion of large skipjack and significantly less bycatch. Associated schools produced more variable tuna catches and higher bycatch rates. Fishing trips in the south had significantly lower bycatch rates than those in the north. This study is the first to quantify bycatch rates in the Maldives pole-and-line tuna fishery and the influence of school association on catch composition. Ratio estimator methods suggest roughly 552.6 t of bycatch and 27.9 t of discards are caught annually in the fishery (based on 2015 national catch), much less than other Indian Ocean tuna fisheries, e.g. gillnet, purse-seine, and longline.

AB  - The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model with smoothing is introduced for modeling count data with many zero-valued observations, and its use is illustrated with shark bycatch data from the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna purse-seine fishery for 1994–2004. Based on the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility of the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data, standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model fit. Comparison of trends among models suggests that the negative binomial regression model may overestimate model coefficients when fitted to data with many zero-valued observations.

AB  - The use of aquatic mammals as bait to enhance the harvest of fisheries species has garnered little attention by the scientific and conservation communities, often receiving only brief mention in reports focused on the human consumption or bycatch of aquatic mammals. A number of studies, however, highlight the negative impact of this practice on affected mammal populations. A systematic review of relevant literature published since 1970 yields new insight into the scope of the issue. Findings indicate that the practice of using aquatic mammals for bait has been and continues to be geographically widespread, has affected at least 42 species, and often involves deliberate killing for the express purpose of securing bait. The nature of the fisheries involved is diverse, encompassing a wide range of target species and gear types; however, shark fisheries that employ longlines appear to be the most widely engaged in using aquatic mammals as bait. This practice appears to be most common in Latin America and Asia. It is evident, based on our review, that there is little information on the impact of the direct take on most targeted mammal populations, commonly small cetaceans, and increased monitoring efforts are needed in many locales. In most instances, the ecology and population dynamics of the targeted fishery species is poorly understood and in some cases the species is classified as threatened, suggesting a fishery sustainability issue that cannot be fully addressed with a substitute for the aquatic mammal bait. It is essential that natural resource managers implement mitigation approaches that consider the socio-economic, cultural, political, and ecological circumstances leading to the use of aquatic mammal bait in each fishery.

This paper discussed the rays capture worldwide by using a variety of fishing gear and also bycatch issues that commonly happen. The efficiency of the fishing gear used in capture ray species is compared and discussed among the countries. This paper distinguishes the maturation size for the female and male ray according to the species presence. The bycatch scenario is also discussed as the majority of this elasmobranch (shark and ray) which is caught as bycatch in both small scale fisheries (gill nets, long lines and hooks) and large scale fisheries (bottom trawl and purse seine).

AB  - Fisheries in all of the earth’s oceans entail direct and indirect effects on marine food webs and on seabirds in particular. Fisheries that target forage species are associated with precipitous declines of seabird populations in the eastern boundary currents of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Uncertainties and variation in physical and biological conditions and in prey and predator distributions however make the attribution of fishing effects to seabird responses extremely difficult. Cascading effects associated with the removal of large piscivorous fishes and other apex predators have had both positive and negative indirect trophic influences on seabirds by either increasing or decreasing the availability of small fishes and other prey in temperate and tropical ocean systems, respectively. Fishery discards and wastes have provided otherwise inaccessible demersal food sources that have benefitted surface-feeding seabirds. Their low nutritive value (“junk food hypothesis”) and subsequent reduction and termination is however having negative effects on inflated populations of scavenger species. Bycatch in fishing gear kills hundreds of thousands of birds annually, though limited collection of systematic data underestimates total mortality. Pelagic long-lines, that target tuna, swordfishes, and sharks in tropical and temperate regions, hook and drown surface feeders (albatrosses, tube-nosed seabirds) many of which are threatened with extinction. Demersal long-lines set for groundfish in temperate, subpolar and polar waters kill large numbers of fulmars and shearwaters. Gillnets in temperate and subpolar regions entangle and drown numerous diving species (auks, penguins, seaducks). Disturbances created by light-based fishing activity for squid and forage and pelagic fishes attract nocturnal seabirds, escalating risks of collisions and gear entanglement. Marine and freshwater aquaculture sites displace and attract seabirds that are often shot, and at times, they provision predatory birds such as eagles. The feed requirements of the expanding aquaculture industry, which produces more fish than capture fisheries, will likely increase the value and intensity of forage fisheries. Increasing consumer demands for wild seafood will ratchet fishing pressure in warming oceans subject to more frequent heat waves and other extreme weather events. These circumstances will create further challenges for the behavior and ecology of marine birds and their populations and diversity. The incorporation of seabird and other predator requirements and information from seabird indicators in ecosystem management would improve biological conservation and fishing sustainability.

AB  - Data collected by on-board observers and from experimental surveys during 2004-2006 were analyzed to figure out the status of shark bycatch in Korean tuna longline fishery. Results obtained from 10 surveys indicated that 14, 13 and 1 species of shark were incidentally caught in Korean tuna longline fishery operated in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic (Mediterranean) Ocean, respectively, and that shark bycatch accounted for about 29-31% of the total catch. Sharks brought aboard were processed in 3 ways; out of 1,127 sharks observed, 575 sharks (51.0%) were discarded after finning, 299 sharks (26.5%) were stored frozen after finning for future use and 253 sharks (22.4%) were released into the sea immediately after caught. The fin to body weight ratio of sharks was estimated to be about 4.7% which is similar to the guideline of 5% established by the international fisheries organizations. The underestimate of shark bycatch in Korean tuna longline fishery was significant because it was general practice that fishermen on-board did not count the discarded shark as a catch.

AB  - Developing nations in tropical regions harbour rich biological resources on which humans depend for food, income and employment, yet data to aid their management is often lacking. In West Africa, the diversity and fisheries of elasmobranchs are poorly documented, despite them being known to be economically important and vulnerable to overexploitation. Rapid qualitative surveys of fish processing and landing sites in The Gambia from 2010-2018 revealed valuable new data on species composition, biology, relative abundance, fisheries and utilisation by humans. Diversity and abundance was dominated by batoids, with a major component comprising a large guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus) that was apparently targeted, and a small whipray (Fontitrygon margaritella). Nearly all taxa recorded are classified by the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered (angel sharks Squatina spp.), Endangered, Data Deficient, or Not Evaluated; several were endemic, of exceptional evolutionary distinctness, cryptic, possibly undescribed, and rare (including stingray Hypanus rudis not apparently recorded since description in 1870). Significant threats to biodiversity, coastal livelihoods and possibly food security are identified based on the apparent importance of elasmobranch fisheries and processing; the known inability of key taxa to withstand intensive fisheries; ‘fishing down the food web’ by intensive utilisation of F. margaritella; and the absence or rarity of previously common elasmobranch species that may be severely depleted in the region. This study provides data that may act as a starting point to aid sustainability accreditation of local fin-fisheries, and demonstrates the value of inexpensive and low-resolution data collection in developing countries.

AB  - High bycatch of non-target species and species of conservation concern often drives the implementation of fisheries policies. However, species- or fishery-specific policies may lead to indirect consequences, positive or negative, for other species or fisheries. We use an Atlantis ecosystem model of the Northern Gulf of California to evaluate the effects of fisheries policies directed at reducing bycatch of vaquita (Phocoena sinus) on other species of conservation concern, priority target species, and metrics of ecosystem function and structure. Vaquita, a Critically Endangered porpoise endemic to the Upper Gulf of California, are frequently entangled by finfish gillnets and shrimp driftnets. We tested five fishery management scenarios, projected over 30 years (2008 to 2038), directed at vaquita conservation. The scenarios consider progressively larger spatial restrictions for finfish gillnets and shrimp driftnets. The most restrictive scenario resulted in the highest biomass of species of conservation concern; the scenario without any conservation measures in place resulted in the lowest. Vaquita experienced the largest population increase of any functional group; their biomass increased 2.7 times relative to initial (2008) levels under the most restrictive spatial closure scenario. Bycatch of sea lions, sea turtles, and totoaba decreased > 80% in shrimp driftnets and at least 20% in finfish gillnet fleets under spatial management. We found indirect effects on species and ecosystem function and structure as a result of vaquita management actions. Biomass and catch of forage fish declined, which could affect lower-trophic level fisheries, while other species such as skates, rays, and sharks increased in both biomass and catch. When comparing across performance metrics, we found that scenarios that increased ecosystem function and structure resulted in lower economic performance indicators, underscoring the need for management actions that consider ecological and economic tradeoffs as part of the integrated management of the Upper Gulf of California.

AB  - A trawl efficiency device (TED) was developed to reduce bycatch whilst maintaining prawn catches and operational ease and safety. The concepts and design of the system, including an innovative flexible grid, are described. The system reduced bycatch, with significantly fewer large rays and turtles being caught than in conventional trawl nets. Video photography indicated that further refinements would be appropriate.

AB  - Global abundances of oceanic pelagic sharks have declined due to overfishing. Internationally protected shark species remain at risk due to indiscriminate bycatch in longline fisheries with under-reported catches affecting reliability of population assessments for management. However, the scale of under-reporting remains poorly understood. Here we use detailed shark species catch data in a global fishing hotspot to show that the discards of three globally or regionally ‘Endangered’ or ‘Critically Endangered’ species (bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus; oceanic whitetip Carcharhinus longimanus; smooth hammerhead Sphyrna zygaena) are potentially under-reported on a large scale: the total discards made by a single observed vessel in April–June 2018 in the eastern tropical Atlantic exceeded by 1.3–11.0 times the discards reported officially for these species Atlantic-wide for all of 2018. Scaling up observed catches (discards) of a single vessel to potential discards made by a single nation's fleet in the region, we estimate a mean annual total of 1526.2 t (±1 S.D. range: 415.3–2637.0 t), which exceeds by 89.2 times (±1 S.D. range: 24.3–154.2 times) the official reported discards for these three species. Without reducing bycatch mortality, which at present appears obscured by substantial under-reporting, Atlantic populations remain at serious risk.

AB  - Blue sharks (Prionaceglauca) are recognised as one of five key pelagic shark species in the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) due to their frequent incidental catch in tuna and billfish longline fisheries. Given their importance in the region, the aim of this study was to investigate the life history of this species for use in future population assessments in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Eighty-one vertebral samples were examined to provide preliminary age and growth estimates for P.glauca caught by commercial longline vessels operating in the Bismarck and Solomon seas. Ages ranged from 10 to 25 years. A Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to estimate growth parameters. The von Bertalanffy model provided the best fitting growth model (males: L∞ = 379 cm, L0 = 45.8 cm, k = 0.07 year−1; females: L∞ = 329.2 cm, L0 = 45.8 cm and k = 0.08 year−1; combined sexes: L∞ = 350.8 cm, L0 = 45.8 cm, k = 0.07 year−1). The asymptotic length parameter estimate for the male P.glauca population from PNG was the largest reported. Our results demonstrate that intraspecific variation in life history traits of P.glauca across its entire distribution is likely due to differences in methodology, sample size and interpretation of growth bands rather than regional differences in growth. This study takes an important step towards facilitating management strategies for P.glauca in PNG by producing preliminary growth estimates for the species. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are required to conduct age validation and refine the life history information for this highly migratory species in PNG.

AB  - While bycatch, the unintentional catch of untargeted species, is one of the main threats to large marine species such as cetaceans, reef sharks and turtles, also known as megafauna, fishers can also be negatively impacted by bycatch. Understanding local fisheries profiles, fishers’ demography and their opinion is thus a necessary part of the strategy to mitigate marine megafauna bycatch in artisanal fisheries. Interviews with fishers were conducted in order to assess the magnitude of marine megafauna bycatch, the dependency of fishers on the fishery and the potential for implementation of bycatch mitigation measures in the artisanal fisheries in Gorontalo, northern Sulawesi (Indonesia). Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the data. Regression trees showed that cetacean and turtle bycatch were mainly influenced by the fishing location, while bycatch of reef sharks, whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) and mobulids was mainly influenced by the gear type. Cetaceans mostly escaped after being caught or were released. Reef sharks, which were often sold for their meat, were caught in the highest numbers followed by sea turtles. Interviewed fishers had large households, typically averaging more than five people, and mostly were dependent on the fishery, often with few other sources of income. Fishers were generally in favour of reducing bycatch as bycatch often posed a financial threat, due to lost catch and damaged gear. When implementing bycatch reduction measures, it is important to involve fishers in design and implementation of mitigation measures. As awareness on bycatch management and mitigation is growing in Indonesia, measures including recordings (official and self-reporting), capacity building on bycatch specimen handling and release and bycatch mitigation techniques (e.g. gear modifications) are some of the most important bycatch reduction strategies for the country.

AB  - Accounting for components of fishing mortality, including post-release mortality (Fr), is necessary for robust assessments of the effects of fishing. Forty-eight blue (Prionace glauca) and 35 silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformes) were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags to monitor Fr rates from pelagic longline vessels in the western tropical Pacific Ocean. There is a paucity of Fr studies at low latitudes and identifying factors that significantly explain Fr is critical for understanding fishing mortality. Mean Fr rates were 0.17 [95% CI 0.09–0.30] for blue shark and 0.20 [95% CI 0.10–0.36] for silky shark. When it occurred, Fr was acute with 87% of mortalities within 2 days of release. Several prognostic operational, environmental, biological and handling variables were evaluated to assess their influence on survival outcomes. Using Kaplan–Meier survival curves, logistic regression, accelerated failure time and Cox proportional hazards models to screen variables, the only significant prognostic or risk variable was health condition at haulback. There was close correspondence (~ 83% accuracy) between condition at capture and survival outcomes. Reliable methods to classify at-vessel condition represent an inexpensive and simple metric for estimating both Fr and at-vessel (Fc) mortality rates. Examining Fc rates in detail in longline fisheries using capture information on depth, temperature and dissolved oxygen that may act in synergy with condition code and hooking duration is a research priority. Results suggest that a large proportion of shark survive following release and that Fr rates can be increased by improving the haulback condition of captured sharks.

AB  - Historically, the Mediterranean Sea supported a rich shark fauna. Presently, however, populations of most shark species have significantly declined, largely due to intense fishing pressure. Interviews with crew members of bottom trawlers, drifting longliners and bottom longliners operating off the Costa Brava (Catalonia, NE Spain) were conducted between October 2016 and July 2017 in order to gather information on the current bycatch rate of several shark species. Interviews covered 41.2% of the fleet and respondents were asked for the bycatch of selected shark species—Alopias vulpinus, Cetorhinus maximus, Galeorhinus galeus, Hexanchus griseus, Isurus oxyrinchus, Mustelus spp., Prionace glauca, and Squalus acanthias—in two distinct time periods. Bottom trawlers captured the highest diversity of species (eight) followed by bottom longliners (seven), and drifting longliners (three). Most respondents (89.7%) declared having captured at least one shark from 2006 to 2016 but only 56.4% declared having captured at least one shark from 2016 to 2017. From 2016 to 2017, the whole fleet captured 89 specimens of H. griseus (95% confidence interval (CI) = 145, 34), 14 of G. galeus (95% CI = 30, 0), 3 of A. vulpinus (95% CI = 8, 0), 3 of I. oxyrinchus (95% CI = 8, 0), 3 of C. maximus (95% CI = 6, 0), and no Mustelus spp. The total bycatch of P. glauca and S. acanthias was uncertain due to extremely loose confidence intervals. A significant decline was perceived by fishermen in the bycatch of C. maximus and S. acanthias, whereas the bycatch of H. griseus was considered to have remained stable. This study suggests a dramatic reduction in the abundance of most of the medium‐sized and large sharks of the Costa Brava and the likely disappearance of Mustelus spp. from the area. Only H. griseus, S. acanthias, and P. glauca are still being bycaught frequently.

AB  - Chondrichthyans are usually caught incidentally in fisheries for species of high commercial value and then discarded on board or landed as by-products. On the coast of Chubut province and adjacent waters (43°00′S–44°56′S) a bottom trawl fishery has developed targeted at the Patagonian shrimp ( Pleoticus muelleri ) and common hake ( Merluccius hubbsi ). Since 2005, this fishery has been monitored by the On-board Observers Program of Chubut province (POBCh). With the aim of advancing towards an ecosystem approach, POBCh not only collects information about target species but also about all the species caught by the trawl nets of the province fisheries. From the information collected by this programme it was possible to identify and record the chondrichthyan species vulnerable to the fishing gear used by the coastal fleet that operates from Puerto Rawson. The composition of the fleet catch was characterized according to the target species during the 2005–2014 period. In the analysis of 3786 hauls, 23 species of chondrichthyans (seven species of sharks, 15 species of batoids and a single species of Holocephali) were identified. Seven species showed a frequency of occurrence greater than 10% ( Callorhinchus callorynchus, Discopyge tschudii, Mustelus schmitti, Sympterygia bonapartii, Psammobatis normani, Squalus acanthias and Zearaja chilensis ). Species spatial distribution was evaluated and five areas of species assemblages were established. Besides the aspects related to bycatch, these analyses have contributed to the knowledge of the chondrichthyan biodiversity in the provincial coast where the fleet operates, a region with incomplete and mostly dispersed and outdated information.

AB  - In Alaska, sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation on longline sets has increased since implementation of the Individual Fishing Quota programme in 1995. A collaborative effort (SEASWAP) between longliners, scientists, and managers has undertaken research to evaluate this depredation with a primary objective to develop and test a passive deterrent that would reduce depredation without reducing catch rate of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). Commercial longliners, fishing for their own sablefish quotas during the regular season, deployed beaded gear (25 mm lucite beads attached to gangions) with control gear and set recorders to collect acoustic data. Beaded and control gear were randomly assigned by skate quad (672 hooks) with 5 quads in each longline set. Acoustic recorders were used to document sperm whale creak–pause events, representative of depredation of the longline gear. Although there were more sablefish per skate quad on the beaded gear and there was a decrease in depredation events on the beaded gear compared with the control, neither effect was significant (p = 0.205 and 0.364, respectively). The SEASWAP project is testing other deterrent strategies including gear modifications and the establishment of a sighting network to improve avoidance.

AB  - Shortfin mako sharks, Isurus oxyrinchus, were listed under Appendix II of CITES in 2019 in part due to the results of the last stock assessment for the North Atlantic population, which determined the population is overfished and experiencing overfishing. With population numbers expected to continue to decline, the managing body, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), has called for efforts to reduce shortfin mako bycatch. We evaluate the potential for reducing mako bycatch by identifying mako hot sets, those with particularly high shortfin mako bycatch. Environmental conditions were evaluated for their influence on catch per unit effort (CPUE) of shortfin mako sharks. Standardized CPUEs were calculated from the US pelagic longline observer program (2004–2012) using a generalized additive model (GAM) with a delta-lognormal approach applied to the environmental variables sea surface height, sea surface temperature, bathymetry, and chlorophyll-a concentration. Quantile regression (QR) was also performed to evaluate whether environmental variables can predict fishing conditions with high CPUE. The results of the GAM and QR methods were compared and assessed for their ability to predict and identify locations where shortfin mako CPUE is particularly high. The results suggest that using the binomial portion of the delta-lognormal model, the probability of positive bycatch, is the best basis to define an algorithm to avoid setting in conditions that might have high mako bycatch. Bycatch avoidance strategies built from probability of positive bycatch perform well enough at identifying hot sets to avoid half the shortfin mako bycatch with only a 20% reduction in effort.

AB  - High fishing pressure on elasmobranchs had caused declines in their populations worldwide, though these declines may not always be observed due to lack of monitoring. The Longnose stingray Hypanus guttatus is one of the most abundant and captured species in Northeast Brazil, mainly as bycatch by shrimp trawl. We aimed to estimate how the population of H. guttatus behaves in the face of different fishing pressures in the Northeast. For this purpose, we used a life matrix analysis from the metadata of three studies in the Northeast of Brazil (Bahia, Alagoas and Rio Grande do Norte). The average annual population growth rate estimated for the three states was strongly negative ( − 11 . 83 %). However, there was considerable regional variation: data from Bahia showed in fact a low level of positive growth (3.24%) compared to the severe population decline ( − 29 . 47 % per year) in Rio Grande do Norte, caused by the high mortality from shrimp trawling We conclude that the Longnose stingray has a high risk of long-term population decline in Northeastern Brazil, mainly caused by the high capture rate of juveniles.

AB  - This study comprised a meta-analysis of elasmobranch bycatch in commercial longline, trawl, purse-seine and gillnet fisheries in order to obtain a general perspective of bycatch patterns, and to expose knowledge gaps and identify management and research priorities. Two bycatch ratios were considered: the number and the weight of elasmobranch bycatch relative to that of the target species captured. Patterns were determined through machine learning algorithms with gear type, oceanic region, habitat and the presence or absence of bycatch management measures as candidate predictors. There are considerable information gaps. Most of the current information on elasmobranch bycatch is for the North Atlantic, which is not where the greatest fishing pressure is exerted, so several fisheries were largely under-represented. Overall for sharks, gear type was the most important predictor with pelagic longline fisheries in the South Atlantic displaying the highest bycatch ratios. No patterns were found for ray bycatch ratios. For the fisheries considered in this study, pelagic longlines, and deep-sea and coastal trawl fisheries had the largest total annual shark and ray bycatch, respectively. Blue sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) dominated the total annual bycatch of longline fisheries. For other fishing gears, the annual species-specific bycatch composition varied across oceanic regions. Many of the fisheries with the largest elasmobranch bycatch operate over large spatial scales and often in international waters. International management, mitigation and cooperation are an essential component for the sustainability of elasmobranch bycatch species. Data collection systems and data availability are required at a global scale to improve assessments of elasmobranch bycatch and this should be a high priority for ongoing management and monitoring.

AB  - The endangered species, Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus is the northernmost and most cold-water shark that is widely distributed in the north Atlantic and Arctic. It inhabits depths from the surface to almost 3000m. It can attain a length of over 7m, weigh up to 1.5t and live several hundred years. As with many shark species, the Greenland shark demonstrates slow growth, long lifespan, late maturity, and small litter size that makes this species vulnerable to fisheries. There is a decline in abundance of Greenland shark since the early 1600s with the steepest decreasing since the early 1800s through the 1940s that is associated with target fishery in the past. During recent years, the major threat for this species relates to large-scale bottom trawl and longline fisheries where bycatch of this species occurs. The main conservation measures for this species should include prohibition of directed fishing and minimization of the incidental catch and mortality.

AB  - During July to November of 2008, the artisanal fisheries captured juvenile sharks belonging to the Carcharhinus and Sphyrnidae family in the Veracruz Reef System (south western Gulf of Mexico). The three most abundant organisms were of the species Sphyrna lewini, Carcharhinus brevipinna and Rhizoprionodon terraenovae. Local fisherman recognized five captured areas of sharks as a direct way or bycatch. Some of these areas are located near to eddies formations and river discharges (high productivity areas). These top predators fed on benthic and demersal prey of coastal and reef habits had been the Teleost group the most important item in its diet. However it is possible to observe differences in its feeding tendency.

AB  - Studies have been conducted in Georgia to examine bycatch in many fisheries, but none has focused on the trawl fishery for cannonball jellyfish Stomolophus meleagris. Although this fishery is relatively new, it presently ranks in the top three by weight (kg) in Georgia, along with the food shrimp and blue crab Callinectes sapidus fisheries. The purpose of this study was to characterize and quantify the finfish and invertebrate bycatch species in the cannonball jellyfish trawl fishery in Georgia. Between December 2005 and December 2012, observers accompanied commercial fishers utilizing trawl gear to target cannonball jellyfish in the coastal waters off Georgia; a total of 133 tows were sampled. Observed tow duration ranged from 0.15 to 1.22 h, averaging 0.55 h/tow. During the study period, 1,488 finfish and 150 invertebrates were collected, and 13 individuals representing four species of concern were present in the bycatch. The most numerous species were the Harvestfish Peprilus paru (n = 677), Cownose Ray Rhinoptera bonasus (n = 185), Atlantic Bumper Chloroscombrus chrysurus (n = 179), Butterfish Peprilus triacanthus (n = 175), and blue crab (n = 114). The estimated numbers of captured cannonball jellyfish and bycatch varied monthly and yielded an overall cannonball jellyfish : bycatch ratio of 291:1. Results suggest that bycatch in the cannonball jellyfish fishery is nominal in comparison with other Georgia trawl fisheries (e.g., shrimp trawl fishery) and is dominated by a few species that are known to associate with jellyfish. Information gained in the present study provides fishery managers with the knowledge necessary to better understand the impacts of Georgia's commercial cannonball jellyfish trawl fishery on other species.

AB  - A total of 32 species were caught in surveys using Madeiran traditional longlines targeting the black scabbardfish (Aphanopus spp.) in the Canarian archipelago (northwest of Africa). Of these species, 15 belonged to the subclass Actinopterygii, 16 species to the Elasmobranchii, and one to the Holocephali. Species of the genus Aphanopus, the target species of this fishery, represented 38.5% of the catch in terms of the number of individuals and 36.4% in relation to the weight of the catch. The bycatch, which are non-target species of commercial interest, comprised only four species: two Teleostei species, Mora mora and Benthodesmus simonyi, which represented approximately 3.2% of the catch in number and 2.4% in weight; and two Elasmobranchii species, Centrophorus granulosus and Centrophorus squamosus, which represented 6.6% of the catch in number and 15.4% by weight. Deep-sea sharks were observed to be the most important component of the incidental catch (discarded species) of the traditional black scabbardfish longline fishery in the Canarian archipelago, representing 35.1% of the catch in number and 38.8% by weight. All of the Actinopterygii species were present in a proportion of less than 1%. The deep-sea shark species that were most frequent in the catches were Zameus squamulosus (44.9%), Deania hystricosa (14.7%), C. squamosus (13.5%), Centroscymnus coelolepis (6.7%) and Etmopterus princeps (5.1%). The ratio between the commercial catch (targeted species and bycatch) and the incidental catch was 1:1 in number of individuals. The ratio between the catch of the target species and the deep-sea sharks was 1:1 in number of individuals and in weight. The proportion of immature sharks constituted 31.7% of the total of all sharks caught.

AB  - Catch, bycatch and discard information is important for the assessment and management of fisheries. Using Chinese pelagic tuna longline observer data from 2010 to 2018, we studied the catch composition in the Chinese pelagic tuna longline fisheries in Atlantic targeting bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), and analyzed the survival status and discard rates of common bycatch species. A total of 55 species, including tunas, billfishes, sharks, sea turtles, cetaceans, seabirds, and other pelagic species, were observed. The results indicated that the catch composition of the Chinese pelagic tuna longline fishery targeting bigeye tuna was significantly different from that targeting bluefin tuna. The annual discard rates of common species decreased over this period. Discard rate by length and discard mortality for common species were varied among species. This is the first study to estimate catch, bycatch, and discard using Chinese pelagic tuna longline observer data in the Atlantic Ocean, which is important for the management of Chinese tuna longline fisheries in Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - Depredation by cetaceans on fisheries is a major issue globally, both in terms of conservation and fisheries economics. The present study conducted in Cyprus, Eastern Mediterranean Sea, aimed to understand the extent, level, and type of cetacean depredation on the albacore tuna pelagic longline fishery, and in particular to quantify and evaluate the economic consequences of depredation and identify potential dolphin-longline conflict areas and mitigation practices for management. The data were obtained from fisher’s logbooks, interviews and onboard observations between June and August 2018. A novel and simple approach was applied to estimate the depredation rate and economic loss by using simple calculations including the number and weight of depredated fish, landings and fishing effort. The results revealed that there is an estimated economic loss per fishing trip of 313.07± 486.19 EUR and an estimated annual economic loss for the entire fleet of 259,272 EUR from depredation caused by cetaceans. The study also estimated that 16,639 albacore tunas were depredated in 2018 and the depredation rate ranged between 0% to 100% with a mean depredation rate of 17% per fishing trip. Depredation by the common bottlenose dolphin and striped dolphin was reported in more than 50% of their fishing trips. Other species that were found to be involved in depredation were the neon flying squid, the shortfin mako shark and the Risso’s dolphin. This is the first official record worldwide of depredation from the common bottlenose dolphin, the striped dolphin and the neon flying squid on the pelagic longline albacore tuna fishery. A total bycatch of 62 individuals of common bottlenose dolphins and one individual of stripped dolphin were reported in interviews as a result of depredation on bait and catch. The study also identified depredation hotspots and possible depredation mitigation measures. Such information could support the development of management action plans and measures to minimise interactions between cetaceans and pelagic longlines.

AB  - Bycatch by longline fisheries, especially by artisanal small-scale fisheries, is one of the main conservation problems for some sea turtle populations around the world. Since 2004, a network of professionals under the “Eastern Pacific Regional Sea Turtle Bycatch Program” have been working with artisanal longline fishers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) to reduce sea turtle bycatch and related mortality. Trials assessing circle hooks of different sizes and shapes, and different baits, have been conducted to determine the effectiveness in the reduction of sea turtle bycatch and changes in hooking location. In this paper, information from 1823 olive ridley sea turtles incidentally captured in the EPO were analyzed to assess how hook type (J, tuna hooks or circle hooks), hook size, bait type (squid or fish), turtle size and target species (tunas, sharks or mahi-mahi) affect hooking location on sea turtles. This were modeled with a Classification and Regression Tree using hooking location as a multinomial variable response (for 6 categories of hooking locations); and also as a binomial response (swallowed vs. non-swallowed) using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Hook type and size, plus bait type, were the most important factors affecting hooking location, while turtle size and target species did not have any significant effect. J-hooks and tuna hooks had a much greater probability of being swallowed than circle hooks. In addition, as the hook size increased, the likelihood of swallowing it decreased. The use of fish bait in combination with larger circle hooks tended to produce higher proportions of external hookings. An increase in external or lower mandible hookings is preferred since these locations are assumed to be less dangerous for the animal's post-release survival, and because hooks and attached gear are easier to remove by well-trained fishermen.

AB  - Incidental catch or bycatch of sea turtles by pelagic longline fisheries is a major concern worldwide. The Northeast Atlantic hosts key foraging and developmental areas for oceanic juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) originating mainly from the Southeastern USA and Cape Verde. This region may be one of the most heavily fished areas by pelagic longline for which no recent assessments of fisheries interactions exist. We analysed fishery observer data collected between 2015 and 2020 to assess sea turtle bycatch by Portuguese commercial longliners targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) in the Northeast Atlantic. A total of 177 sea turtles interacted with the gear during the 896 fishing sets (887,641 hooks) monitored. Loggerheads (n = 139) ranging between 32 and 78 cm curved carapace length (CCL) were caught at a rate of 0.152 turtles per 1000 hooks, and leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea; n = 38) between 100 and 210 cm estimated length at a rate of 0.043 turtles per 1000 hooks. Loggerhead and leatherback bycatch shows a clear seasonal pattern in the region. At haul-back mortality rates of oceanic-stage juvenile loggerheads was estimated at 26% whereas no at haul-back mortality was registered for leatherback turtles. Model estimates, based on AIS derived fishing effort from Global Fishing Watch, indicate a total of 1439 interactions (552–3069 BCI) for loggerhead, and 604 interactions (262–1129 BCI) for leatherback turtles between 2016 and 2020. Information from this study is essential to support effective management strategies for sea turtle conservation in the Northeast Atlantic.

AB  - Bycatch production in the recently developed monkfish (Lophius gastrophysus) fishery off southern Brazil was assessed from 14 observer trips conducted by a chartered gillnet fleet during 2001. Catch composition and discard ratios were estimated in 523 selected sets conducted between latitudes 22°44′S and 34°21′S and longitudes 33°37′W and 52°23′W and between the 132 and 607m isobaths. The monkfish constituted on average 40.7% of all organisms entangled in each observed set. Among non-targeted species geryonid crabs (mostly the royal crab, Chaceon ramosae) and spider crabs (Majidae) were the main components representing 22.6% and 8.5% of total entangled organisms, respectively. The remaining 23% included mostly teleosts and elasmobranchs, such as beard fish (Polimixia lowei), silver john dory (Zenopsis conchiffer), gulf hake (Urophycis cirrata), argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), angel shark (Squatina argentina) and various skates (Rajidae). Geryonid crabs and angel sharks were the most retained and processed bycatch components (88.8, 50.0% of numerical catches, respectively). Discard ratios were higher than 75% in all other species entangled by gillnets, including abundant or valuable species, such as the wreckfish (Polyprion americanus). Catch rates of large-size bycatch components, such as dolphins, birds, sharks, rays and the wreckfish were poorly correlated with fishing effort and seem to have been mostly affected by the overlap between these species concentrations or higher diversity areas and the southernmost monkfish fishing grounds. Geryonid and majid crabs were correlated with monkfish catches and fishing effort, being most frequently caught north of 29°S. This pattern was related not only to a target/not-target species distribution area overlap, but also to an elevated vulnerability of these crustaceans to gillnet operations. Proposed measures for bycatch reduction in the monkfish fishery in future, include area closures within monkfish southern fishing grounds and effort reduction measures. Whereas the former would minimize mortality on wreckfish, angel shark and also royal crab populations, effort reduction would benefit particularly the royal crab, which constitutes a conflict aspect of deep-water trap and gillnet fishery development off southern Brazil.

AB  - The sandpaper skate, Bathyraja kincaidii, is commonly taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries off central California. The impact of fisheries exploitation on this population is unknown, however little is known about its biology, including its reproductive life history. To determine reproductive aspects of B. kincaidii, 506 individuals were collected from commercial trawls, museum collections, and monthly trawl and longline surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service. Males ranged from 112 to 635 mm TL, whereas females ranged from 113 to 610 mm TL. Males reach first maturity at 440 mm TL and at ~3 years, whereas females reach first maturity at 450 mm TL, approximately 1 year later. Size and estimated age at 50 % maturity were similar between sexes: 492 mm TL and 7.5 years for males and 467 mm TL and 7.1 years for females. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) values indicate a continuous reproductive cycle, with a seasonal peak in the summer and fall, and a resting period following egg case deposition.

AB  - The spinner dolphin is the most commonly seen dolphin in tropical pelagic waters, as it leaps and spins in the air. There are several recognized subspecies. The skull is similar to that of several other small delphinids. It can be very abundant, with regional populations of up to hundreds of thousands. Habitats vary from shallow waters around islands to the high seas. Prey consists mostly of small fishes and squids. Predators include sharks and some smaller toothed whales. The reason for the spinning behavior is unknown. Sexual maturity is reached in females at about 8–9 years and in males at 7–10 years. Gestation is about 10 months. The mating system may vary among populations. Large numbers have been killed as bycatch in the tuna purse seine fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific; one population has been reduced to half its original size. They are also hunted and taken as bycatch in many other regions.

AB  - The capture of pelagic sharks as bycatch of the South African pelagic longline fleet targeting tuna Thunnus spp. and swordfish Xiphias gladius was investigated during the period 1998-2005. In all, 26 species were caught, of which six are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (lUCN) as Vulnerable and one (scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini) as Endangered. Blue shark Prionace glauca and short-finned mako Isurus oxyrinchus were the most commonly caught species (69.2% and 17.2% respectively). Generalised linear models explained 70.4% of blue shark and 22.2% of short-finned mako bycatch patterns and showed that vessel name was the most important explanatory variable. Other significant explanatory variables included month, year, area, bathymetry, bait type, moon phase and time of set. South African-flagged, swordfish-directed vessels caught more sharks (11.7 blue sharks and 1.4 short-finned mako sharks per 1 000 hooks) than Asian-flagged, tuna-directed vessels (1.8 blue sharks and 0.9 short-finned mako per 1 000 hooks). The catch per unit effort of blue sharks and short-finned mako sharks started to decrease from 2001 and 2000 respectively. This was accompanied by a decrease in average length for both species over the period 2002-2007. Three techniques for extrapolating total shark mortality were investigated. Simple extrapolation yielded an estimate of 73 500 sharks per year; if vessel flag was taken into account, the estimate decreased to 39 200 sharks per year and to 43 100 sharks if vessel flag and area (5° grid cells) were taken into account.

AB  - Background Whale sharks have received significant research attention in recent years, yet key questions on their biology and ecology remain unanswered. This continues to hamper the conservation assessment of the species. The critical mass of whale shark researchers at IWSC4 presents an opportunity to collaboratively develop strategic research initiatives to close these knowledge gaps. Approach Thispresentation is intended to promote discussion, and eventual consensus, on key research questions and approaches. Accompanying this presentation will be a discussion document. My aim is to publish a multi-author manuscript outlining a framework for achieving medium-term (the next five years, to 2020) applied research objectives for whale sharks. Results Mykey questions are: (1) How many whale sharks are there? Movement models applied at single sites consistently point to transience, with a degree of site fidelity in some individuals. Some mark-recapture models are better-suited than others to modelling this reality. A more existential challenge is that, at most aggregations, we are disproportionately sampling juvenile male sharks. We need to understand habitat use of other life stages and incorporate them into population models. (2) Are regional populations present? Two major genetic subpopulations exist, in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific, respectively. Further genetic/genomic studies, along with the expansion of photo-ID studies and medium- to long-term electronic tag deployments, will be vital in clarifying smaller-scale divisions. Biochemical studies are also showing promise. This work is vital, as the human threat profile differs between regions. (3) Are regional populations, if they exist, increasing or decreasing? Whale sharks are highly mobile. Even studies that have attempted to control for biophysical variation, such as in Mozambique, have documented declines in sightings that are steeper than can be explained by known human pressures. On the other hand, in at least some areas where whale shark sightings are on the increase, such as in the Azores, changes in the long-term ocean climate is a likely contributor. An improvement in our ability to relate local sighting trends to broader abundance is necessary. More data on whale shark demographic parameters, such as age at maturity and reproductive periodicity, are also required to understand the potential timeframe for recovery. (4) How can human impacts be mitigated? Some clear threats to large whale shark aggregations remain, such as the active whale shark fishery in southern China, ship strikes off the Quintana Roo coast in Mexico and in the Arabian Gulf, and the inadequate management of purse-seine bycatch. These examples, and others, require specific examination. (5) What is the best overall strategy for ensuring population recovery? Broadly, large juvenile and adult females are the most important individuals to the species' rebound potential. Identifying human threats to these life stages, and mitigating them, will be the most efficient means of reversing population decline. Regionally, identifying high-priority threats (i.e. the most significant impact on the largest number of sharks) will help with the development of practical mitigation strategies. Conclusions Effectivemanagement requires good data. I hope that the discussions we start at IWSC4 will go a long way towards aligning our regional research objectives towards answering these global questions in the shortest possible timeframe.

AB  - Longline fisheries throughout the world have frequent and often fatal interactions with seabirds. We experimentally tested one possible solution to seabird–fisheries interactions that was proposed by a New Zealand longline fisherman. This involved dripping school shark Galeorhinus galeus liver oil on the ocean surface behind fishing vessels. We tested the efficacy of shark liver oil in reducing the numbers of seabirds attending fishing vessels and the number of dives seabirds executed in pursuit of pilchard Sardinops neopilchardus baits. We conducted trials in northern New Zealand where seabird assemblages include the globally vulnerable black petrel Procellaria parkinsoni. Shark liver oil was effective in reducing both seabird numbers and dives on baits, compared to canola oil and seawater control treatments. Comparisons of seabird responses to shark liver oil and vegetable oil suggest that shark liver oil acts as an olfactory or chemesthetic deterrent for seabirds. Further work should include testing the oil with additional seabird species and investigating active ingredients and habituation of seabirds to the oil in order to assess wider opportunities for long-term use of shark liver oil to reduce seabird bycatch.

AB  - The speartooth shark Glyphis glyphis is a Critically Endangered whaler shark known from a few tropical river systems in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. There is limited genetic exchange in populations residing in northern Australian rivers that are greater than 100 km apart. In Queensland, the species is only found in the Wenlock and Ducie River that flow into Port Musgrave. Juveniles are confined to upstream reaches of these rivers with seasonal downstream movement related to freshwater influx. This region also supports commercial and recreational fisheries including crab pot and gillnet fisheries. Being obligate ram-ventilators, entrapment in crab pots results in mortality of bycaught speartooth sharks after a few hours. Following anecdotal reports of juvenile speartooth sharks being captured in crab pots, we investigated catch rates in crab pots experimentally and examined commercial fishing effort in the Wenlock and Ducie River from logbook data. Twenty four juvenile (55–80 cm TL) speartooth sharks were captured in experimental crab pots in the Ducie River and Tentpole Creek (a tributary of the Wenlock River) with catch rates high; up to 0.82 (±1.86 SD) sharks pot–1 day–1. Experimental catch rates in crab pots varied between rivers and with distance upstream and were highest in areas of highest shark density based on detection of acoustically tagged sharks over 7 years and line fishing catch per unit effort data. Although commercial crab effort varies spatially and temporally in relation to current catch rates and market demands, consistent monthly overlap with juvenile speartooth shark core distribution occurred throughout the year. Using CPUE data multiplied by fishing effort in Tentpole Creek, we estimate that in November alone, between 51 and 279 speartooth sharks are potentially captured in years with high fishing effort. Bycatch of juvenile speartooth sharks in commercial and recreational crab pots poses a significant threat to this genetically isolated and small population. Urgent management intervention to drastically reduce bycatch mortality either through gear modifications or spatial closures are required to ensure the viability of this population.

AB  - Chondrichthyan populations in the Mediterranean Sea have been heavily affected by the impact of fishing activities. In the last two decades, even fishing gears that were traditionally considered highly selective, such as pelagic longlines, have been revealed to be responsible for the capture of many unwanted species. The pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) is not an endangered nor a charismatic species, but it largely dominates longlines bycatch fractions.The aim of our study was to investigate the importance of three main variables, bait size, presence and type of light attractors, and hook size and shape, in the capture rate of pelagic stingrays. Ninety-seven longline experimental sets were run. Trials took place on nine vessels in the Strait of Sicily, central Mediterranean Sea, over a period of 3years from 2005 to 2007. Results showed that the larger the J hook, the lower the stingray capture rate. Moreover, 16/0 circle hooks had a significantly lower number of stingrays captured per 1000 hooks than J hooks, up to ∼80%. Bait size, within the range of sizes assessed, and use of light attractors did not have significant effects on stingray catch rate. These results suggest that the adoption of large circle hooks by commercial and artisanal swordfish longlining may be a measure to reduce their environmental footprint.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a circle hook ring on catch rates of target fish species and bycatch rates of sea turtles, elasmobranchs, and non‐commercial fish in a shallow‐set Italian swordfish longline fishery. Results were compared from 65 sets from six commercial fishing vessels totalling 50 800 hooks in which ringed and non‐ringed 16/0 circle hooks with a 10° offset were alternated along the length of the longline. In total, 464 individuals were caught in the 4 years of experiment, with swordfish (Xiphias gladius) comprising 83% of the total number of animals captured. Catch rates of targeted swordfish were significantly higher on ringed hooks (CPUEringed hooks = 8.465, CPUEnon‐ringed hooks = 6.654). Results indicate that ringed circle hooks captured significantly more small‐sized swordfish than non‐ringed circle hooks (27.7% vs. 19.5%, respectively). For species with sufficient sample sizes, the odds ratio (OR) of a capture was in favour of ringed hooks; significantly for swordfish (OR = 1.27 95%CI 1.04–1.57), and not significantly for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) (OR = 1.50, 95%CI 0.68–3.42) nor for pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrigon violacea) (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.54–2.36). All six loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and three of the four blue sharks (Prionace glauca) were captured on ringed hooks, however, the small sample sizes prevented meaningful statistical analysis. In summary, results from this study suggest that the addition of a ring to 16/0 circle hooks confers higher catchability for small‐sized commercial swordfish, and does not significantly reduce catch rate of bycatch species and protected species in a Mediterranean shallow pelagic longline fishery. These findings should motivate fisheries managers to consider factors in addition to hook shape when aiming to promote sustainable fishing practices. The presence of a ring has the potential to negate some conservation benefits. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Data from voluntary logbooks (5,884 longline sets) collected between 1997 and 2000 were analyzed to assess the potential impact of the Reunion-based longline swordfish fishery (South West Indian Ocean) on sharks and on sea turtle populations. Blue shark (Prionace glauca) represented between 75% and 88% of the total catches of sharks studied. Bycatch discarding varied with species, ranging from low discards (2.6%) for mako shark (Isurus sp.) to high discards for blue shark (86.5%). Estimation of the total catch of sharks (retained and discarded individuals) represented in weight between 7% and 9% of the total catch of the major species caught by the fishery. Of concern is the decline of blue shark CPUE (Catch Per Unit of Effort) from 2.2 to 1.03 sharks per 1,000 hooks between 1998 and 2000. Of the 22,974 hook-timers deployed during cruises onboard commercial, 49% of the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and 41.2% of the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) were retrieved alive. It was assumed that among the 15,250 blue sharks caught during this period, at least 7,099, released alive, could have survived.The observed sea turtle catch rates were low compared with those reported for other longline fisheries. The fishery had 47 interactions with Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), 30 with Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), and 16 with Green turtles (Chelonia mydas).

AB  - During the last decade, particular attention has been paid worldwide to the problem of bycatch and discards in fisheries. Collaborative research between fishermen and scientists is important to fisheries management. Partnerships with commercial longline fishermen were developed to enable them to participate in two research projects in order to integrate their information, experience and expertise. These programmes, financed by the fishing industry and regional councils were designed to describe the activity of the fisheries, to assess the scale of fishery effects on the various taxa, to study the ecology and explore spatial population genetic structure in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea of the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and sting rays (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) and finally to propose mitigation measures to reduce impacts on elasmobranchs, sea birds and sea turtles. Communication, education, post-implementation monitoring and long-standing collaboration are the key factors to success. This presentation shows the progress realized to date.

AB  - For many years, tremendous effort has been dedicated to developing new industrial tuna fisheries, while their adverse impacts on threatened marine species have received relatively little attention. In tuna fisheries, bycatch is the major anthropogenic threat to marine megafauna in general, particularly sharks. Research on the development of gear technology for bycatch reduction and potential mitigation measures helped tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations adopt bycatch reduction management measures. After reviewing past research on the development of mitigation measures for pelagic longline and tropical purse seine fisheries based on pelagic species' behaviours, we describe promising new approaches integrating recent technological breakthroughs. New innovations include autonomous underwater vehicles carrying cameras along with miniaturized sensors, aerial drones, computer simulation of fishing gear geometry, environmental DNA assays, computer visualizations and deep learning. The successful application of such tools and methods promises to improve our understanding of factors that influence capture, escape and stress of caught species. Moreover, results emerging from recent ethological research explaining the power of social connection and learning in the “fish world” such as social learning from congeners, habituation to deterrents, and how past fishery interactions affect responses to fishing gear should be taken into account when developing technical mitigation measures.

AB  - Tuna fisheries have been identified as one of the major threats to populations of other marine vertebrates, including sea turtles, sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. The development of technical mitigation measures (MM) in fisheries is part of the code of conduct for responsible fisheries. An in-depth analysis of the available literature regarding bycatch mitigation in tuna fisheries with special reference to elasmobranchs was undertaken. Studies highlighting promising MMs were reviewed for four tuna fisheries (longline, purse seine, driftnets and gillnet, and rod and line – including recreational fisheries). The advantages and disadvantages of different MMs are discussed and assessed based on current scientific knowledge. Current management measures for sharks and rays in tuna Regional Fishery Management Organizations (t-RFMOs) are presented. A review of relevant studies examining at-vessel and postrelease mortality of elasmobranch bycatch is provided. This review aims to help fisheries managers identify pragmatic solutions to reduce mortality on pelagic elasmobranchs (and other higher vertebrates) whilst minimizing impacts on catches of target tuna species. Recent research efforts have identified several effective MMs that, if endorsed by t-RFMOs, could reduce elasmobranchs mortality rate in international tropical purse seine tuna fisheries. In the case of longline fisheries, the number of operational effective MMs is very limited. Fisheries deploying driftnets in pelagic ecosystems are suspected to have a high elasmobranchs bycatch and their discard survival is uncertain, but no effective MMs have been field validated for these fisheries. The precautionary bans of such gear by the EU and by some t-RFMOs seem therefore appropriate. Recreational tuna fisheries should be accompanied by science-based support to reduce potential negative impacts on shark populations. Priorities for research and management are identified and discussed.

AB  - The piked dogfish Squalus acanthias is part of the bycatch of several South American longline fisheries, although in Argentina, it was only reported in the bycatch of benthic and demersal fisheries operating bottom nets. This communication represents the first record of S. acanthias bycatch in a commercial semi-pelagic longline fishery within Argentinean waters. In October-November 2005, 185 piked dogfish were captured (122 females and 63 males). The estimated mean catch rate was 0.37 sharks/1000 hooks (544,320 hooks deployed). Nearly half of the captured females and over 50% of captured males were morphometrically mature. The piked dogfish bycatch could have been influenced by the use of the Argentine shortfin squid Illex argentinus as bait; this squid is part of the sharks natural diet. Although S. acanthias is abundant in the region, we believe that the bycatch species could be more vulnerable than the targeted ones since the signs indicating a declining population of non-target species in commercial catches and collapses in bycatch populations go unnoticed El tiburn espinoso Squalus acanthias es capturado incidentalmente en diversas pesqueras sudamericanas de palangre, aunque en Argentina la captura incidental ha sido informada en pesqueras de arrastre de fondo. Esta comunicacin representa el primer registro de la captura incidental de S. acanthias en una pesquera comercial de palangre semi-pelgico en aguas nacionales. Entre octubre y noviembre de 2005, se capturaron 185 tiburones espinosos (122 hembras y 63 machos). La tasa de captura media fue de 0,37 tiburones/1000 anzuelos (544.320 anzuelos calados). Aproximadamente la mitad de las hembras y ms del 50% de los machos estaban morfomtricamente maduros. La captura incidental del tiburn espinoso habra sido influenciada por el uso de calamar Illex argentinus como carnada que constituye parte de la dieta natural del tiburn. Aunque S. acanthias es abundante en la regin, se cree que las especies que conforman la captura incidental podran ser ms vulnerables que las especies objetivo, ya que los signos en el decrecimiento poblacional en las capturas comerciales y los colapsos poblacionales de aquellas especies no-objetivo pasan inadvertidos

AB  - The dusky finless skate Gurgesiella furvescens appears sporadically as part of the bycatch in the trawl fishery targeting demersal crustaceans on the continental shelf and upper slope of the north-central area of Chile (26ºS-33ºS). Demersal crustaceans could be forage for deep-water predators such as G. furvescens, and sizes and shapes of prey eaten could be restricted by mouth size. The diet composition of G. furvescens was determined based on specimens collected from the bycatch of trawls targeting demersal crustaceans in 2013. Stomach contents revealed nylon shrimp Heterocarpus reedi (32.8% by weight), deep-water shrimp Haliporoides diomedeae (7.2% by weight), and indeterminate crustaceans (9.0% by weight). The diet composition was similar between sexes, body length, or depth strata. Prey size was a linear function of Gurgesiella furvescens mouth width, and prey mass positively related with G. furvescens individual mass. Although squat-lobsters Pleuroncodes monodon and Cervimunida johni were abundant in the study area, the nylon shrimp and deep-water shrimp in the diet of G. furvescens may be due to the preference or selection of this kind of prey in deep waters.

AB  - Background Tounderstand the historical and present occurrence and distribution patterns of whale sharks along the west coast of India in the Arabian Sea, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) questionnaire surveys were conducted during May 2012 to March 2013. The surveys were conducted in the maritime states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and the union territory of Lakshadweep. Approach Thesurvey was targeted at active and non-active fisher-folk between the ages of 25 and 90 years to obtain information on historical and current presence of whale sharks in fishing territories across the West Coast. Results Atotal of 1703 fisher folk in 118 fishing villages were interviewed using an improvised structured questionnaire developed from the standard TEK and ITK questionnaires. Over 60% of the interviewed fishers reported having sighted whale sharks in the Arabian Sea along the west coast during their fishing activities 20–100 km from the shoreline. Sightings were most frequent in the Lakshadweep Sea followed by the coastal waters of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa. Four major whale shark aggregation locations in the Arabian Sea were identified: close to the coast of Malvan in the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra, Netrani Island in Uttar Kannada of Karnataka, Minicoy and Kavaratti Island in Lakshadweep and along the Saurashtra coast of Gujarat. The whale shark aggregation locations that were identified as a result of this study were found to overlap with key marine resource productivity areas, such as paste shrimp (Acetes sp.) abundance zones. The incidental capture of whale sharks in fishery operations over the last few years were notably high along the Kerala coast followed by Maharashtra. The mean number of respondents (in each village) who had caught whale sharks using gill nets were significantly higher (Kruskal-Wallis x2 218.56, df 2, p <0.05) than the mean number of respondents (in each village) who had caught the species using either purse-seine or trawl nets. Conclusions Thesurvey results indicate a lack of awareness amongst the fishing community of the whale shark being a protected species and the ban on their capture and trade; it emphasizes the need tolaunch an intensive awareness campaign along the west coast of India. The respondents also mentioned that the most common human induced threats to the whale sharks are incidental catch in gill net, purse seine and trawl.

AB  - The lack of a long term, comprehensive and reliable fisheries statistics system is a major impediment to fisheries management in Brazil. Fishing is one of the main activities throughout the country's coast, with predominance of small-scale, artisanal, multigear, and multispecies captures that are landed in a pulverized network of coastal villages. Brazil is also a hotspot of common names, another feature that challenges artisanal fisheries' monitoring. We combined taxonomic and ethnobiological information to support the implementation of an artisanal fisheries' monitoring program under the co-management framework of a Marine Extractive Reserve in Bahia State, Northeastern Brazil. We surveyed 141 fishing landings, recording 86 fish species (43 families) and 52 correspondences 1:1 between local and scientific names. Broad folk categories had an average of 5.1 specific names, with "cação" (shark) being the category with more specific names (24 names to six biological species). With the exception of species that make up the bycatch captured by shrimp trawling, fisherfolks are able to identify commercially important species from both fresh specimens and photos. Common names can be reliably used in fisheries monitoring programs, and their usage facilitates the participation of fisherfolks in surveys based on voluntary or compulsory declarations of captures

AB  - Pseudobatos prahli is considered a low-medium fishing importance species in Ecuador, caught as target species and bycatch in both artisanal and industrial fisheries. Despite its importance, some basic aspects of its biology remain unknown, turning its study a priority. The aim of the present research was to describe for the first time the reproductive biology of P. prahli based on the analysis of individuals landed in the port of Santa Rosa, Province of Santa Elena, Ecuador. A total of 96 females and 165 males were sampled from January 2013 to January 2014. Females presented larger sizes (51-86 cm total length, TL) than males (51-78 cm TL), but no significant differences were found between the mean sizes of both sexes. The sexual proportion of landed individuals (0.6F:1M) suggested that free-living individuals segregate by sex, however, sex proportion of embryos was similar to the proportion 1F:1M. The number of mature individuals (64%) in the landings was larger than the immature ones (36%). Mean size at maturity (L50) of females (65.9 cm TL) was also slightly larger than that for males (61.8 cm TL). Size at birth was estimated at 22.5 cm TL. Ovarian fecundity ranged from 1 to10 and uterine fecundity from 1 to 6, and a positive but low linear relationship was found between both fecundity estimates and maternal size. Based on the comparison of some reproductive parameters, such as mean size at maturity, gestation period and fecundity, it can be concluded that P. prahli is one of the species with lowest biological productivity among the species of the same genus.

AB  - Prior to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, little research effort was focused on studying deep-sea sharks in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). While the biology of these fishes remains virtually unknown, they are routinely captured in commercial fisheries as bycatch. In the absence of basic biological data, and with the probability of post-release survival unknown for most species, effective management plans cannot be formulated, making populations highly susceptible to overfishing. Any potential detrimental effects of the DWH oil spill, which occurred at 1500 m deep, are also unknown. Following longline capture, we characterized the physiological blood biochemical parameters related to secondary stress and compared them among seven shark species occurring on the continental shelf edge and slope in the GoM at depths ranging from 200 to 2000 m<i>.</i> We also investigated the relationship between blood parameters and depth as well as proximity to the oil spill site. The deep-sea sharks examined here exhibited variability in blood chemistry associated with the secondary stress response, with values falling within published records for previously studied elasmobranchs. Results suggested that there is greater relative physiological stress in shallower-dwelling sharks as well as smaller-bodied sharks. Further, the rate of core temperature warming was fastest in smaller bodied sharks, which likely contributes to greater physiological stress. The core temperatures of the larger-bodied, deeper-dwelling species were not altered as drastically as the smaller-bodied sharks after being hauled to the surface. Any chronic physiological effects of the oil spill were not detectable as there were no relevant correlations between blood chemistry metrics and proximity to the DWH oil spill site.

AB  - Thresher sharks are known to have substantial economic value. They are caught globally as target and as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Due to their declining population, they are listed as an appendix II species on CITES, therefore any form of trade and fisheries related to the species have been nationally and internationally regulated. However, information on thresher shark fisheries in Bali is still limited. This study aims to socio-economically characterize thresher shark fishermen in Manggis, Karangasem. The research was conducted in August 2020 – October 2020 by interviewing 53 out of 119 recorded shark fishermen using a structured questionnaire. Shark fishermen use surface longlines to catch thresher sharks (Alopiidae) in between 3 areas, North Nusa Penida-Karangasem, east Nusa Penida and Bangko-Bangko. The fishermen catch sharks exclusively during the months of June-October and catch tuna the rest of the year.  Operational costs for 1 boat ranges between Rp 121.000 – Rp 250.000 during 1 round trip. The income generated from shark fishing each trip averages to about Rp 627.714 per boat.  Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, some of the fishermen work jobs in the tourism sector. However, due to the pandemic’s impact on tourism, they have no choice but to be fishermen full time. Although thresher shark fisheries in Manggis are generally small scale, conservation and management strategies need to be implemented to ensure sustainable use of shark resources.

AB  - The species composition and bycatches of a new trawl for crustaceans (Heterocarpus reedi, Cervimunida johni and Pleuroncodes monodon) was studied in central Chile between 2007 and 2009. The spatial and temporal variations of the catch composition were analyzed using univariate and multivariate comparison techniques. In 289 trawl hauls, 72 taxa were recorded, with target species accounting for most of the catch, while the bycatch consisted mainly of Merluccius gayi, Hippoglossina macrops, Coelorinchus aconcagua, Epigonus crassicaudus and Platymera gaudichaudii. 14 species of elasmobranchs were identified, and at least one of these species was present in 50% of the hauls made. The classification and ordination methods showed the existence of three groups, each one associated with a target species, with no significant spatial and temporal effects. The information obtained in this study represents the basis for setting targets in order to reduce the bycatch captured by this trawl. The focused strategy on the most recurring and sensitive species for these fisheries is also discussed.

AB  - The stock of blacknose sharks Carcharhinus acronotus in the U.S. South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is overfished, and according to the 2007 stock assessment conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service overfishing continues to occur. Penaeid shrimp trawl bycatch rates in the Gulf of Mexico were modeled for this species as well as for the Atlantic sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon terraenovae and bonnethead shark Sphyrna tiburo using a combination of research trawl and observer data. Research trawls have never used turtle excluder devices (TEDs), which are expected to exclude larger specimens of blacknose sharks. Most of the observer data that contain blacknose shark occurrences were collected during the pre‐TED era when the two data sets tracked one another. Minimum observer data were available for the post‐TED period (1990–present). As a consequence, the pre‐TED (1972–1989) relationship between observer and research trawl catch per unit effort (CPUE) is driving the observer CPUE estimates from 1990 to the present, a period characterized by increased blacknose shark abundance. We suspected that the increase in predicted observer CPUE in the post‐TED era is an artifact of application of the pre‐TED observer and research trawl relationship to the post‐TED era. This suspicion led us to question whether the bycatch of these species was altered due to the use of TEDs. We used negative binomial regression in a before‐after‐control‐impact setting to test the effects of TEDs on the bycatch rates of these small coastal sharks. The TED effect was found to substantially reduce the bycatch of blacknose sharks (by 94%) and to do so moderately for bonnethead sharks (31%); the results were inconclusive for Atlantic sharpnose sharks. The management implication of our findings is that the existing small coastal shark–penaeid shrimp fishery bycatch model needs to be modified or replaced with a model that explicitly incorporates the potential for a TED effect.

AB  - The regulation of mesh size is important for the effective and sustainable management of fisheries using gillnets, which are the main fishing gear used in artisanal elasmobranch fisheries throughout northwestern Mexico. Gillnet selectivity studies focusing on elasmobranchs have generally evaluated the impact on target species, and information on bycatches remains scarce. This study assessed the impact of gillnet selectivity on both target elasmobranch species and bycatches, by varying the mesh size of gillnets. Sampling was performed from 2009 to 2015 in five artisanal fishing grounds located along the northwestern coast of Mexico. The species composition and ecological parameters of the elasmobranch communities that were caught, as well as the size structure and estimated selectivity models for the main species caught, were compared between four mesh sizes: 10.16, 15.24, 20.32 and 25.4 cm (stretched opening). Overall, 32 elasmobranch species were caught, nine of which were common to all mesh sizes. Our results indicate that the species composition of the catch varied with mesh size. While the small-sized sharks Mustelus californicus and M. henlei were the main species caught by gillnets with the smaller mesh sizes, the guitarfish Pseudobatos productus and Zapteryx exasperata, and the Pacific angel shark Squatina californica were the main species caught gillnets with the largest mesh sizes. Gillnet selectivity was estimated for these latter four species as well as for the horn shark Heterodontus francisci. Optimum length for these species varied widely, increasing proportionally to mesh size. These findings emphasize the difficulty of determining an optimal minimum mesh size for multi-species fishery in this area. Finally, recommendations for future directions according to the species' vulnerability to fishing are discussed, focusing on the development of effective strategies to initiate or strengthen the recovery of elasmobranchs of the northwestern coast of Mexico.

AB  - The South African midwater trawl fishery targets adult horse mackerel Trachurus capensis. The bulk of the catch is taken by a single freezer-trawler, the biggest fishing vessel operating in South African waters. As fishing takes place off the south coast in ecologically sensitive areas, there are concerns about the potential impacts of this fishing operation on non-target species. Fishing behaviour and bycatch of this fishery from 2004 to 2014 were investigated by analysing observer records with regard to catch composition, volume and temporal and spatial patterns. The midwater trawl fishery was estimated to have caught 25 415 tonnes annually, with a bycatch of 6.9% of the total catch, by weight. There are species overlaps with various fisheries, namely the demersal trawl, small-pelagic, line, shark longline and squid fisheries, yet the total bycatch estimates from this fishery are generally small relative to catches taken in the target fisheries. Bycatch species with the highest average annual catches were chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, redeye roundherring Etrumeus whiteheadi, ribbonfish Lepidopus caudatus and hake Merluccius spp. Large-fauna bycatch species included sunfish Mola mola as well as a number of CITES II- and IUCN-listed species, such as Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena and thresher sharks Alopias spp. The 97.9% observer coverage is high and the 6.9% bycatch rate low compared to other South African fisheries; however, due to the large size of the individual hauls (average of 46.3 t), the average sampling rate of 1.56% is low. Our analyses suggest that bycatch in the South African midwater trawl fishery has been lower than in other South African fisheries and similar fisheries elsewhere, but due to the combination of high catch volumes and low sampling rates, estimation errors for rare species are high and there is a substantial risk of incidental unmonitored bycatch of rare large fauna and aggregations of small fauna. This could be mitigated by spatio-temporal management of this fishery, to avoid fishing in high-risk areas, and the introduction of an electronic monitoring programme.

AB  - We conducted a meta‐analysis of literature reporting on the use of circle hooks and J‐hooks in pelagic longline fisheries. Our study included more data than previous meta‐analyses of the effects of hook type, due to both a larger number of relevant studies available in recent years and a more general modelling approach. Data from 42 empirical studies were analysed using a random effects model to compare the effects of circle hooks and J‐hooks on catch rate (43 species) and at‐vessel mortality (31 species) of target and bycatch species. Catch rates with circle hooks were greater for 11 species, including four tuna species, six shark species and one Istiophorid billfish. Catch rates on circle hooks were lower for seven species, including two Istiophorid billfishes and two species of sea turtle. At‐vessel mortality was significantly lower with circle hooks in 12 species, including three tuna species, three Istiophorid billfishes, swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and three shark species. No species had significantly greater at‐vessel mortality when captured with a circle hook rather than a J‐hook. While our general approach increased model variability compared to more detailed studies, results were consistent with trends identified in previous studies that compared the catch rates and at‐vessel mortality (between hook types) for a number of species. Our results suggest that circle hooks can be a promising tool to reduce mortality of some bycatch species in pelagic longline fisheries, although the effects depend on the species and the metric (catch rate or at‐vessel mortality), emphasizing the need for fishery‐specific data in conservation and management decisions.

AB  - Industry standard fishing hooks used prior to 2004 during Us commercial pelagic longline (Pll) fishing were the 8/0–10/0 J-hooks with a 20°–25° offset—a lateral deviation of the hook point relative to the hook shaft. However, federal regulations enacted in 2004 require the Us Pll industry to employ circle hooks allowing up to 10° offset during fishing operations. Until recently, there have been no studies directly comparing the performance of non-offset and 10° offset circle hooks in commercial Pll applications. Our study alternated non-offset and 10° offset circle hooks along the gear length on individual Pll deployments in the western north atlantic, gulf of mexico, and Windward Passage in the caribbean sea. The study compared the relative performance of both hook types in terms of: (1) catch rates, (2) percent mortality, and (3) the percentage of deep-hooked target and bycatch species. For swordfish, Xiphias gladius (linnaeus, 1758), several experiments indicate: (1) marginally higher catch rates, (2) significantly lower mortality, and (3) significantly less deep hooking on non-offset than 10° offset circle hooks. Most of the performance differences for blue marlin, Makaira nigricans lacépède, 1802, were insignificant; however, one study produced significantly higher mortality on 10° offset than non-offset circle hooks. The present study suggests that, relative to non-offset circle hooks, 10° offset circle hooks may reduce fishing efficiency and can counteract the conservation benefits commonly associated with circle hooks (e.g., lower mortality). However, additional research is required to assess the effects of offset hooks on tunas, billfishes, and elasmobranchs.

AB  - Sharks and rays are often caught as bycatch by commercial fisheries, and high incidences of bycatch are partially to blame for the declines in many populations of elasmobranchs. In an effort to reduce rates of bycatch, researchers have tested various deterrents that could benefit fisheries. Permanent magnets are one promising form of bycatch reduction device, yet their efficacy has only been tested for hook-and-line fisheries with variable results. Here, we examined the potential benefits of permanent magnets on an ocean fish trap fishery targeting snapper (Pagrus auratus) where more than 10% of the total catch is comprised of unwanted elasmobranchs and the presence of elasmobranchs reduces the catch of target species. Over 1000 fish traps were deployed in a fishery-dependent survey in New South Wales, Australia. Standardised catch rates indicate that the incorporation of magnets into fish traps significantly reduced incidences of elasmobranch bycatch (mainly Brachaelurus waddi) by over a third, while increasing the amount of target fish caught by an equivalent amount. Together these results suggest that magnets can be used as an effective bycatch reduction device that reduces incidences of elasmobranch bycatch while increasing the profitability of fish traps for fishermen. Future studies should aim to replicate these results in areas where different species of elasmobranchs occur.

AB  - The present study assesses the effects of a Morrison soft turtle excluder device (TED) upon catch rates of commercial prawn, fish and non-commercial bycatch species at an essentially oceanic site and an estuarine site. Effects of the TED upon catch rates were highly variable. Reductions in prawn catch (Penaeus plebejus, Penaeus esculentus, Metapenaeus bennettae) in the TED-equipped net varied between no significant reduction to a 29% reduction, by weight, depending on location and season. Reductions in prawn catch could not be attributed to the loss of prawns by species or solely to the selective loss of prawns on the basis of size. Fish catches (Sillago sp., Platycephalus sp., suggrundus sp.) were highly variable and showed no significant difference between control and TED-equipped nets. Catches of marketable sand crabs (Portunus pelagicus) were reduced by more than 50% in the TED-equipped net. Large bycatch animals, such as shovelnose rays (Rhinobatus batillum), sand rays (Amphotistius kuhlii) and turtles (Caretta caretta), were caught occasionally in the control net but were absent from the TED-equipped net. Non-commercial bycatch, composed of fish and crustaceans, was reduced by up to 32% by weight in the TED-equipped net. Results from this study suggest that it is difficult to predict accurately the effect of the Morrison soft TED upon catches of prawns and bycatch for all trawl locations and seasons.

AB  - Sustainable fisheries' managers increasingly seek to implement measures that reduce the mortality of threatened species while maintaining or increasing catch of target species. Our study proposed a simple management option for optimizing fishing over daily and seasonal scales to maximize catch success while protecting non-target species in pelagic longline fisheries. We used Bayesian beta mixed regression models to describe the effects of setting times and seasonality on catches in a pelagic longline fishery in the southwest South Atlantic Ocean (SWAO). Targeted species (swordfish, blue shark, and albacore tuna) are typically captured in fully nocturnal sets (started between 16 and 00 h), whereas shortfin mako shark and loggerhead turtles are typically captured during partially nocturnal sets (started between 00 and 04 h); probably a response to hook depth and circadian behaviours. The results suggest that it is feasible to use only fully nocturnal sets to target preferred species while reducing incidental catch of non-target species. The catch of target species was higher in austral winter, explained by the northward displacement of the subtropical convergence in the SWAO during this season. These results provide a baseline for bycatch mitigation strategies in pelagic longline fisheries at regional and global scales.

AB  - The majority of deep-water fish have very low capacity to survive discarding as fishery bycatch due to their biological characteristics and adaptation to depth. This study explores the catch and post-release mortalities of several deep-water shark species caught by bottom longline in the El Cachucho (Le Danois Bank) MPA in northern Spanish waters (NE Atlantic). Survivorship was qualitatively evaluated according to health condition and responses of individuals after capture and subsequent release. A total of 15 species were caught, of which the most abundant were leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (39%), birdbeak dogfish Deania calcea (39%) and Portuguese dogfish Centroscymnus coelolepis (10%). Catch or at-vessel mortality (AVM) for these species was lower than expected, 1.2%, 8.8% and 4.5%, respectively but 18.9%, 37.4% and 38.6% including both those specimens dead on retrieval and those scored in poor condition). The species with the highest vitality rate was C. squamosus (37.3% in good condition; 43.8% in moderate condition), followed by D. calcea (22.8% in good condition; 39.8% in moderate condition) and C. coelolepis (6.8% and 54.5%). Post-release mortality (PRM) was examined using electronic tags (PSATs, n =14). Of the nine C. squamosus tagged successfully, three died within 5–10weeks after release, whereas the other six survived for periods of at least 45–120days, when tags were programmed to release). In the case of C. coelolepis, two of the four tagged specimens died almost immediately after release, whereas the other two tags indicated that the fish survived immediate release, but data were too limited to gauge survival due to tag failure.

AB  - Bycatch of marine mammals in the gillnet sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery in the Great Australian Bight prompted managers to assess the use of demersal automatic longlines as an alternative method to target gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus). The school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) is a migratory species that is occasionally taken as bycatch when targeting gummy shark, and the stock is currently managed under a rebuilding strategy. We used pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) to investigate the survival, movements, and habitat use of mature female school shark (147–170cm total length) following capture and release from demersal automatic longlines. Satellite telemetry data indicated lively school sharks survived the capture, on-board handling, tagging and release processes. Tracked school sharks mostly moved offshore and across the continental shelf in south to south-easterly directions. Depth habitat use reflected semi-pelagic behavioural traits and a preference for lower mixed layer depths of 50–100m where water temperatures were 15–21°C. Two PSATs provided data that we interpreted as indicative of tag and/or tagged shark ingestion, and tag regurgitation by endothermic predators. This study also identified an area where neonate and large, mature female school sharks were observed together during the Austral summer. Findings of this study are crucial to informing current fisheries management, stock recovery and bycatch mitigation strategies off southern Australia.

AB  - The smooth hammerhead Sphyrna zygaena (Sphyrnidae) is a pelagic shark occasionally caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, but is one of the least studied of all pelagic sharks. Age and growth of S. zygaena was studied along a wide Atlantic region covering both the northern and southern hemispheres. Data from 304 specimens, caught between October 2009 and September 2014, ranging in size from 126 to 253 cm fork length (FL), were analysed. Growth models were fitted using the three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) re-parameterized to calculate L0 (size at birth). Growth models were fitted to the sample data and data from several back-calculation models. The model fit to the quadratic modified Dahl-Lea back-calculated data seems to be the most appropriate to describe growth in this species, with resulting growth parameters of Linf = 285 cm FL, k = 0.09 year−1 for males and Linf = 293 cm FL, k = 0.09 year−1 for females. Compared with other species of the same genus, estimated growth coefficients for S. zygaena seem to fall in the low to middle range. Although further work is still needed, this study adds to knowledge of the vital life-history parameters of smooth hammerheads in the Atlantic Ocean, which can be used in the management and conservation of this species.

AB  - This study describes the first potential multi-species shark nursery area in Atlantic Africa (Sal Rei Bay – SRB, Boa Vista Island, Cabo Verde). From August 2016 to September 2019, 6162 neonates and juveniles of 5 different shark species were observed in SRB using beach gillnet-based bycatch surveys, namely milk (Rhizoprionodon acutus; n= 4908), scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini; n= 1035), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus; n=115), Atlantic weasel (Paragaleus pectoralis; n= 93) and nurse (Ginglymostoma cirratum; n= 12) sharks. Except for nurse sharks, significant seasonal variations in shark relative abundance were observed, with higher levels being recorded during summer and autumn. These findings, together with local knowledge (interviews to fishermen), denote the consistent use of SRB by juvenile sharks and its preference relative to other areas in the region. Ensuring the protection and conservation of SRB nursery area is especially relevant as, according to IUCN, all identified shark species are threatened with extinction over the near-future – in particular, scalloped hammerheads (critically endangered) and Atlantic weasel sharks (endangered). The effective protection of SRB will not only support the conservation of shark populations, but also of other charismatic fauna (e.g., loggerhead turtles) and broader benthic and pelagic ecosystems.

AB  - Chondrichthyans (sharks, batoids and chimaeras) play key roles in the regulation of marine food webs dynamics. However, more than half of the assessed species in the Mediterranean are threatened, primarily by fishing pressure and compounded by habitat degradation and climate change. Nevertheless, there is an important knowledge gap in identifying the underlying drivers of their community structure and spatial distribution. We provide insights into the current bycatch rates of chondrichthyans in the western Mediterranean commercial bottom trawling fishery by accurately depicting the unaltered practices of the local fleet. A total of 17 species were recorded in the studied fishing grounds (ranging from 50 to 800 m deep), including 7 sharks, 9 batoids, and 1 chimaera, although the total catch was dominated by few species. Furthermore, we tested the effect of environmental and fishing-related factors on multiple community descriptors by using analysis of community structure (multidimensional scaling and analysis of similitude) and generalized linear mixed models to further understand the drivers of the chondrichthyan community distribution and structure. This study revealed the importance of combining environmental and anthropogenic drivers to further understand the spatial distribution patterns of chondrichthyan communities. Our results indicate that depth was the main driver of the community structure, with deeper areas within the fishing grounds hosting a higher diversity. Sea bottom temperature and substrate type also influenced the distribution of the community, with substrate effects changing depending on the intensity of fishing pressure. In all cases, density, biomass, and diversity of chondrichthyans were negatively impacted by increasing fishing effort. Understanding the drivers of the structure and distribution of the chondrichthyan community is crucial to understand the potential impacts that increased fishing pressure, habitat loss and global change may entail. The ongoing challenges that the Mediterranean chondrichthyans and their ecosystems are facing highlights the need for continued monitoring and improved chondrichthyan-focused fisheries management.

Biodiversitas 19: 2275-2282. This investigation was conducted to determine the bycatch composition of cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) trawlers in Bushehr and Hormozgan waters during fishing season 2013. Data collection was carried out in the summer for Bushehr and in the autumn for Hormozgan province for one month. All trawler vessels were equipped with a 36 m head rope and 75 mm stretched mesh size in the codend and 90 to 200 mm stretched mesh size in the panel. 47 species included 35 species of teleosts, 9 species of elasmobranches and 3 species of invertebrates were identified in Bushehr. Also, 48 species included 38 species of teleosts, 7 species of elasmobranches and 3 species of invertebrates were identified in Hormozgan. The weight and numerical averages of bycatch species were 25.41 (kg h-1) and 205.9 (n h-1) in Bushehr, and 92.58 (kg h-1) and 440.4 (n h-1) in Hormozagan. I. megaloptera, S. tumbil, N. japonicus, D. acuta, C. sexfasciatus, L. equulus in Bushehr and P. sextarius, I. megalopteran, M. cinereus, P. macrophthalmus, N. japonicus and S. tumbil in Hormozgan had highest catch weight. Based on the weight and number, PCA and nMDS methods were indicative of two different assemblages in hunting places. Furthermore, ANOSIM similarity analysis confirmed the results of PCA and nMDS and showed a significant difference in the catch composition of two fishing zones.

AB  - Bigeye tuna (BET), yellowfin tuna (YFT) and skipjack tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean, in general, are underfished. However, according to Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) who is mandated to assess the fishing impact on tuna and bycatch, the fishing impact on BET juveniles (including from Indonesia) were identified as high level impact. Productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA) was used to assess the risk of tuna and sharks. The objectives of this study were to identify the types of tuna fisheries operated in Indonesias water (FMAs 713-715) which harm tuna and sharks species. Result shows that tuna was mainly caught by purse seine, pole and line, and longline. Purse seine fishing has a higher impact than the pole and line and longline fishing. Blue shark, hammerhead shark and silky shark in particular whale shark were at risk due to purse seine fishing, without proper management. Information regarding their niches and seasonal migrating patterns are required for further studies.

AB  - This paper presents data on the incidental catch of sea turtles in both the Brazilian exclusive economic zone and adjacent international waters (both areas are located mainly in the south-western Atlantic) by Brazilian commercial pelagic longliners targeting swordfish, tuna and sharks. Data were obtained by on-board observers for 311 trips carried out in 2001–2005, totalling 7385 sets and 11,348,069 hooks. A total of 1386 sea turtles were incidentally captured in the five years (some of them were considered dead at capture): 789 loggerheads ( Caretta caretta ), 341 leatherbacks ( Dermochelys coriacea ), 45 green turtles ( Chelonia mydas ), 81 olive ridleys ( Lepidochelys olivacea ) and 130 of unknown species. Taking into account the distribution of the fishing effort in the study area and the incidental catch of sea turtles, four regions were highlighted for the analyses: Zone 1 is located off the northern Brazilian coast; Zone 2 is located off the central Brazilian coast; Zone 3 is the region off the southern Brazilian coast; and Zone 4, located in the open sea almost totally within international waters, is the region around a chain of undersea mountains known as the Rio Grande Rise (Elevação do Rio Grande). There is no information on the origin (nesting areas) of the captured olive ridleys, but there is some evidence, obtained through genetic and demographic analyses, that loggerheads, leatherbacks and green turtles inhabiting the open ocean around Brazil originate from nesting areas in several countries. Together with the fact that the south-western Atlantic is fished by longliners again from several countries, this places the conservation of sea turtles in that part of the ocean in an international context. Some conservation actions carried out by Brazil concerning the interaction between pelagic longlines and sea turtles in the study area are described.

AB  - 1. Incidental catches by the pelagic longline fishery is a major global threat for loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) sea turtles. 2. The reduction of incidental capture and post‐release mortality of sea turtles in the Brazilian pelagic longline fishery, operating in the south‐western Atlantic Ocean, was investigated by comparing the performance of 18/0 circle hooks with 9/0 J‐type (control) hooks. Hook selectivity experiments were performed between 2004 and 2008, in a total of 26 trips, 229 sets and 145 828 hooks. The experimental design included alternating control and experimental hooks along sections of the mainline. 3. An overall decrease in capture rates for loggerhead turtles of 55% and for leatherbacks of 65% were observed when using circle hooks. In addition, deep‐hooking in loggerheads decreased significantly from 25% using J‐hooks to 5.8% with circle hooks, potentially increasing post‐release survival. 4. Circle hooks increased catch rates of most of the main target species, including tunas (bigeye Thunnus obesus and albacore T. alalunga), and sharks (blue Prionace glauca and requiem sharks of the genus Carcharinus), with no difference in the capture rates of yellowfin tuna (T. albacares), shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini and S. zygaena), and dolphinfish or mahi mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). On the other hand, a significant decrease in the capture rate of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) was detected when using circle hooks. 5.

AB  - Bycatch and discards are common and recurrent problems faced by fishing industry all over the world. In India, the bycatch issue is more complex due to the multi-species and multi-gear nature of the fisheries. Trawling remains a controversial method due to the non selectivity nature of the trawl net. A study was conducted during October, 2015 to May, 2016 using shrimp trawls in the traditional trawling grounds of Mumbai coast to reveal the catch composition, bycatch characterization and monthly variations in catch per unit effort (CPUE) generated by single day trawlers. The maximum catch was contributed by Sciaenids (35%), followed by Sharks and Rays (10%), Anchovies (10%), Prawns (8%), Bombay duck (6%) and other demersal species. The study identified 143 species including juveniles of commercially important fishes and shellfishes from the shrimp trawl bycatch. Catch was increased from new moon to full moon and from full moon to new moon irrespective of fishing effort. Mean monthly bycatch generated by shrimp trawling ranged from 11.82 to 20 . 65 kg h − 1 , in different months with an overall average of 16 . 82 ± 0 . 97 (SE, n = 8 )  kg h − 1 . The present study highlighted the urgent need for improving the selectivity of the trawl system, in order to mitigate its impacts on non-targeted resources. The results will be beneficial for researchers and policy makers associated with a co-ordinated plan to address trawl bycatch management options.

AB  - AIM: Trypanorhyncha cestodes comprise a wide range of heteroxenous parasites infecting elasmobranchs as definitive hosts. Limited data exist on the larval infection of these cestodes and the role of intermediate and paratenic hosts in the life cycle of these parasites. We investigated the factors that determine the occurrence and the level of infection of <i>Grillotia</i> plerocerci in the skeletal muscles of various benthonic sharks and analyzed the parasites through an integrative taxonomic approach. LOCATION: Mediterranean Sea. METHODS: Sharks obtained as bycatch of commercial trawling activities (i.e., <i>Etmopterus spinax</i>, <i>Galeus melastomus</i>, and <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i>) were used in this study. Data from a limited number of <i>Dalatias licha</i> and <i>Scyliorhinus stellaris</i> were also included. <i>Grillotia</i> plerocerci were molecularly characterized using the partial 28S large subunit rDNA. Boosted regression trees were used to model the relationship between the abundance of infection with both morphological and physiological predictors in each host. RESULTS: Plerocerci of <i>Grillotia</i> were detected in all shark species except <i>S. stellaris</i>. Host species significantly differed in terms of parasite abundance, with the highest and lowest prevalence and abundance of infection detected in <i>G. melastomus</i> and <i>E. spinax</i>, respectively. The relative influence of the traits involved in explaining the parasite abundance was related to the host size in <i>G</i>. <i>melastomus</i>, while both morphology- and physiology-related traits explained the patterns observed in <i>E</i>. <i>spinax</i> and <i>S</i>. <i>canicula</i>. The 28S rDNA sequences shared an identity of ∼99.40% with a <i>Grillotia</i> species previously found in the Mediterranean Sea. At intraspecific level, two different genotypes were found. A first type was retrieved only from <i>D</i>. <i>licha</i>, whereas a second type was found in <i>G. melastomus</i>, <i>E. spinax</i>, and <i>S. canicula</i>. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Present results suggest that the two genotypes could be involved in different consumer-resource systems and confirm most of the examined shark species as transport hosts of <i>Grillotia</i> species for unknown larger top predators.

AB  - The smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena, is a cosmopolitan semipelagic shark captured as bycatch in pelagic oceanic fisheries, especially pelagic longlines targeting swordfish and/or tunas. From 2012 to 2016, eight smooth hammerheads were tagged with Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags in the inter-tropical region of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, with successful transmissions received from seven tags (total of 319 tracking days). Results confirmed the smooth hammerhead is a highly mobile species, as the longest migration ever documented for this species (> 6600 km) was recorded. An absence of a diel vertical movement behavior was noted, with the sharks spending most of their time at surface waters (0-50 m) above 23°C. The operating depth of the pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth Recorders, and the overlap with the species vertical distribution was calculated. The overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is higher for juveniles (~40% of overlap time). The novel information presented can now be used to contribute to the provision of sustainable management tools and serve as input for Ecological Risk Assessments for smooth hammerheads caught in Atlantic pelagic longline fisheries.

AB  - The smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena, is a pelagic shark occasionally captured as bycatch by industrial pelagic longline fleets in the Atlantic Ocean. Data for this study were collected by fishery observers, between 2003 and 2016. Datasets analyzed included information on catches per unit effort (CPUE), size and sex of smooth hammerhead sharks bycaught by the Portuguese pelagic longline fishery in the Atlantic Ocean. A total effort of 2 523 288 hooks yielded 638 sharks, ranging in size from 123 to 275 cm fork length. Larger sharks tended to occur in open ocean habitats and smaller specimens in coastal areas. Results confirmed the wide latitudinal range of the species (45 °N–35 °S), although CPUE was higher closer inshore within the Tropical North and Equatorial regions. An overall sex ratio of 1.4 males for each female was observed, with more males in both inshore and offshore waters. Significant differences in CPUE and size distribution were found between regions, years and quarters of the year. Mean CPUE increased and mean specimen size decreased in the Equatorial region from 2012 onwards. In order to remove fishery-dependent effects from CPUE data, a Tweedie Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to create a relative index of abundance (standardized CPUE). The index showed some oscillations in the initial years (2008–2010), followed by a decreasing trend until 2013 and then an increasing trend in more recent years, until 2016. The distributional patterns and indicators presented in this study provide a better understanding of the smooth hammerhead shark’s spatio-temporal dynamics and population structure in the Atlantic Ocean and can be used to improve management and conservation measures for this species.

AB  - Elasmobranchs are priority species for conservation due to their rapid decline determined by the unbalanced struggle between a fragile bio-ecology and strong anthropogenic impacts, such as bycatch from professional fishing. In this context, measuring species resistance to catch of poorly selective gear is of paramount importance. During June–October 2022, five experimental fishing campaigns were carried out in the Asinara Gulf (northern Sardinia) through 35 geographically and bathymetrically representative hauls of an area between 30 and 600 m in depth. Skates prevailed over sharks in the number of species, with seven and five species, respectively. We first evaluated the status of each individual with respect to stress due to the trawl’s catch using a three-graded scale. We also recorded individual biometrics (total and disk length, weight and sex, and maturity for males) on board by implementing the best practices in manipulating individuals for physiological recovery and release at sea. After capture, skates resulted in generally better conditions than sharks, although deepwater species of both groups exhibited a worse state than coastal species. The estimated vitality rates also depended on the size of the individuals. This work provides standardized data on the intermingled effect of size, species type, and inhabited depth on the resistance response of some elasmobranch species against capture by trawl fishery activities.

AB  - Large‐scale pelagic fisheries exploit a diversity of apex predators with a wide range of life history strategies. Exploitation of species with different life history strategies has different population and food web consequences. We explored the changes in predation that result from exploitation of a common species with a slow growth and low fecundity life history strategy (blue shark, Prionace glauca) with those that result from exploitation of a common species with fast growth and high fecundity (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares) in the central Pacific Ocean. Longline fisheries directed toward billfishes and tunas also capture blue sharks as incidental catch. Mortality rates of sharks had been relatively low prior to the recent surge in finning that has resulted in a substantial rise in mortality of adult and subadult sharks in the last decade. We estimated the magnitude of changes in predation by populations of yellowfin tuna and blue sharks in response to longline fisheries that involve shark finning. Bioenergetics models for sharks and tunas were coupled to simple population models that account for changes in size‐structure in response to fishery‐induced mortality regimes in order to estimate predation responses to changes in fishing intensities. Our analyses demonstrate that blue shark populations are very sensitive to low exploitation rates, while yellowfin tuna populations are extremely robust across a wide range of exploitation rates by longline fisheries. Although predation rates by yellowfin tuna are 4–5 times higher than by blue sharks, longline fisheries have substantially greater effects on shark predation than on yellowfin tuna predation at the food web scale. Expected food web responses will be strongest where the unexploited biomass of long‐lived species is high and predation is relatively specialized compared with other apex predators. Our analyses suggest that active management to reduce finning mortality in sharks will play an important role toward minimizing the effects of longline fisheries on the food web structure of the pelagic Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Changes to fishing gear configurations have great potential to decrease fishing interactions, minimize injury and reduce mortality for non-target species in commercial fisheries. In this two-part study, we investigate potential options to optimize fishing gear configurations for United States Pacific pelagic longline vessels to maintain target catch rates whilst reducing bycatch mortality, injury, and harm. In part one, a paired-gear trial was conducted on a deep-set tuna longline vessel to compare catch rates and catch condition of target and non-target species between wire and monofilament leader materials. Temperature-depth recorders were also deployed on hooks to determine sinking rates and fishing depth between the two leader materials. In part two, hooks of different configurations (size, diameter, shape, metal type, and leader material) were soaked in a seawater flume for 360 days to obtain quantitative estimates of breaking strength, as well as the time taken for gear to break apart. We found that switching from wire to monofilament leaders reduced the catch rate of sharks by approximately 41 %, whilst maintaining catch rates of target species (Bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus). However, trailing gear composed of monofilament did not break apart even after 360 days. In contrast, branchlines with wire leaders began to break at the crimps after approximately 60 days. Additionally, the breaking strength of soaked fishing hooks was greater for larger, forged hooks composed of stainless steel typically used in United States Pacific longline fisheries. These results have direct implications for fisheries management and the operational effectiveness of bycatch mitigation strategies for longline fisheries worldwide.

AB  - Schroederichthys saurisqualus is a small shark endemic to the southwestern Atlantic, with known distribution on the upper continental slope of southern Brazil, ranging between 122 and 435 m in depth, where it is a trawling bycatch component. In the present study, 124 S. saurisqualus specimens collected between 280 and 500 m in depth from September to October 2002 were analyzed concerning reproductive and feeding aspects. Specimen sizes ranged from 252 to 610 mm total length (TL) for males and 280 to 602 mm TL for females. All males larger than 550 mm TL presented calcified claspers, while seven females (524 to 602 mm TL) presented forming eggs. The data reported herein indicate a first maturity size of about 500 mm TL for both males and females. Stomach content analysis identified the squid Illex argentinus as the most frequent prey, observed in 76.86% of the examined stomachs. The results indicate that S. saurisqualus displays a mate-finding strategy during the reproductive season, when squid predation ocurrs. However, this behavior puts this small catshark population in a vulnerable situation, since intense squid trawling activities are noted during the same period in the same area, exposing the local juvenile S. saurisqualus population to higher fishing pressures.

AB  - The decline in traditionally valuable fish stocks, coupled with an increased demand for shark fins and meat has caused many fishermen to target sharks. However, there is limited information on the fishing practices, gears, and catch distribution for the shark fisheries. This study used a semi-structured interview to characterize the shark fisheries and techniques used to catch sharks as well as the catch statistics and trade in fifteen coastal communities along the Eastern, Central, and Western coasts of Ghana. Out of the 470 fishers interviewed, 46% were specialized shark fishers while the remaining 54% landed sharks as bycatch. Specialized shark fishers captured between 7–10 individual sharks per fishing trip while by-catch shark fishers captured between 1–5 sharks. The shark species harvested include the blue shark, thresher shark, common and sand tiger, bull shark, short and longfin mako shark, hammerhead, and milk shark. Fishers along the eastern coast mostly capture sharks as bycatch, while those along the central and western coast of Ghana target sharks with specialized fishing gears. The catch data obtained from the fishers indicated higher shark landings and was linked to the development of longlines and drift gill nets with hooks attached to the footrope that target sharks, and are usually deployed along the western coastlines of Ghana. Nearly all the shark species captured in the study communities were listed by the IUCN as either “Endangered”, “Critically Endangered” or “Vulnerable”. Among fishers who target sharks, 74% stated that shark populations were declining and were spending more effort to capture the fish. Specialized shark fishers indicated a poor perception and attitude towards shark conservation along the entire coastline of the country and are not in support of shark conservation. It is recommended that the capture and trade in these species should be closely monitored to prevent the extinction of vulnerable populations.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are vital for food security, nutrition, and livelihoods in coastal areas throughout the world's oceans.<sup>1-9</sup> As intricately linked social-ecological systems, small-scale fisheries require management approaches that help ensure both ecological and socioeconomic sustainability.<sup>7</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>10-14</sup> Given their ease of use and lucrative nature, coastal gillnet fisheries are globally ubiquitous.<sup>10</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>15</sup> However, these fisheries often result in high discarded capture of non-target organisms (bycatch) that can lead to significant cascading effects throughout trophic chains<sup>16-18</sup> and costly fisheries restrictions that result in important revenue losses in coastal communities with scarce economic alternatives.<sup>19</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>20</sup> Despite these challenges, few solutions have been developed and broadly adopted to decrease bycatch in coastal gillnet fisheries, particularly in developing nations.<sup>5</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>21</sup> Here we used controlled experiments along Mexico's Baja California peninsula to show that illuminating gillnets with green LED lights-an emerging technology originally developed to mitigate sea turtle bycatch-significantly reduced mean rates of total discarded bycatch biomass by 63%, which included significant decreases in elasmobranch (95%), Humboldt squid (81%), and unwanted finfish (48%). Moreover, illuminated nets significantly reduced the mean time required to retrieve and disentangle nets by 57%. In contrast, there were no significant differences in target fish catch or value. These findings advance our understanding of how artificial illumination affects operational efficiency and changes in catch rates in coastal gillnet fisheries, while illustrating the value of assessing broad-scale ecological and socioeconomic effects of species-specific conservation strategies.

AB  - We examine the impact on pelagic fish hooking survival rates (defined as the proportion of fish alive upon gear retrieval) of the rapid switch from J-hooks to circle hooks that was required of the us pelagic longline fishery operating in the atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico after august 2004. Our focus was on 12 fish taxa that are commonly caught as bycatch or retained for the market, and for which individual disposition (live or dead) information was available from 1992 to 2010. To test the hypothesis of no change in survival before vs after the circle hook rule went into effect, we utilized a repeated measures logistic regression approach which accounted for variation in several operational, environmental, and biological covariates, including bait, fishery target, fishing zone, soak duration, water temperature, maximum fishing depth, and fish size (length). For white marlin and albacore, results were mixed, with both increases and decreases in hooking survival varying by fishing zone. For blue shark and lancetfish, no significant differences in hooking survival were detected between the pre- and post-circle hook rule time periods. However, for the remaining eight taxa (swordfish, yellowfin tuna, dolphinfish, bigeye tuna, escolar, silky shark, blue marlin, and sailfish), significant increases in survival were evident. Our results are generally consistent with previous experimental and fishery observer longline studies which suggested circle hook use has the potential to increase hooking survival. Results imply that the 2004 circle hook rule has provided increased opportunities for: (1) live release for several bycatch species; and (2) improved quality (and perhaps prices) of targeted and incidentally-caught taxa that are retained for the market.

AB  - Globally, bycatch in tropical/subtropical shrimp trawl and longline fisheries is threatening many marine species. Here we examine the joint effects of increased mortality caused by shrimp trawling bycatch, and reduced predation caused by losses of large sharks because of longline fishing. Research surveys in the Gulf of Mexico (1972–2002) demonstrated precipitous declines in shallow water coastal elasmobranchs where shrimping effort was highest (bonnethead 96%, Bancroft's numbfish (lesser electric ray) 98%, smooth butterfly ray > 99%) and consistent increases in deeper water elasmobranchs (Atlantic angel shark, smooth dogfish). These increases are the first empirical support for predation release caused by the loss of large sharks, which have been theorized to structure tropical/subtropical marine ecosystems. Bycatch of elasmobranchs in shrimp trawls is a critical conservation concern which is not solved by present mitigation measures; similar loss of elasmobranchs is expected to be occurring in tropical/subtropical regions worldwide where ever intensive shrimp trawling occurs.

AB  - Relative to target species, priority conservation species occur rarely in fishery interactions, resulting in imbalanced, overdispersed data. We present Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs) as an intuitive extension of the Random Forest algorithm to handle rare event bias. Each Random Forest receives individual stratified randomly sampled training/test sets, then down-samples the majority class for each decision tree. Results are averaged across Random Forests to generate an ensemble prediction. Through simulation, we show that ERFs outperform Random Forest with and without down-sampling, as well as with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique, for highly class imbalanced to balanced datasets. Spatial covariance greatly impacts ERFs’ perceived performance, as shown through simulation and case studies. In case studies from the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery, giant manta ray Mobula birostris syn. Manta birostris and scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini presence had high spatial covariance and high model test performance, while false killer whale Pseudorca crassidens had low spatial covariance and low model test performance. Overall, we find ERFs have 4 advantages: (1) reduced successive partitioning effects; (2) prediction uncertainty propagation; (3) better accounting for interacting covariates through balancing; and (4) minimization of false positives, as the majority of Random Forests within the ensemble vote correctly. As ERFs can readily mitigate rare event bias without requiring large presence sample sizes or imparting considerable balancing bias, they are likely to be a valuable tool in bycatch and species distribution modeling, as well as spatial conservation planning, especially for protected species where presence can be rare.

AB  - We describe the 1994 and 1995 releasable bycatch (bycatch) of sharks (Carcharhinidae and Sphyrnidae) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico fishery for gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus. “Releasable bycatch” is defined as catch of nontarget species observed in the purse seine from the time it is brought alongside the carrier ship until all the catch is pumped into the hold and the net is cleaned. Shark bycatch in the gulf menhaden fishery was positively skewed, 726 sharks being observed in 30% of the fishing sets sampled. Ten species of sharks were identified, blacktip sharks Carcharhinus limbatus being the most common. Approximately 20% of sharks were not identified to species. At the time of release, 75% of the sharks in the bycatch were dead, 12% were disoriented, and 8% were healthy. An annual bycatch of approximately 30,000 sharks for the fishery was estimated for the 1994 and 1995 fishing seasons. By means of a logit model, the likelihood of observing shark bycatch was explained by spatial and temporal differences within the fishery and the size of the menhaden catches. In 1995, we observed significant temporal differences in bycatch in the fishing grounds between 90° and 93°W, where much of the fishery's effort occurred. The odds of observing sharks was highest in April and May. In addition, the odds of observing a set with shark bycatch were 2.4 times as great for fishing sets with a catch greater than 16 metric tons than for sets with a smaller catch. Stomach analyses of sharks suggest their occurrence in the fishery is probably the result of a predator–prey relationship between sharks and gulf menhaden. Although detailed age and maturity data were not collected, comparisons of the length distributions to those found in the literature indicated that the fishery may be affecting a portion of the primary and secondary nursery grounds of sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - At-sea observer programmes can provide spatio-temporal data on the sizes and quantities of fish being either discarded or retained, including for species and size categories that may not be sampled effectively during scientific surveys. Such data were analysed for English and Welsh fisheries operating on the continental shelf of the North Sea ecoregion (ICES Divisions 4a-c and 7d) and Celtic Seas ecoregion (ICES Divisions 6a, 7a-c, e-k) for the period (2002-2016). These data were collated for four main gear types: beamtrawl, nephrops and otter trawls, and nets (including gillnets, tangle nets and trammel nets). Beamtrawlers caught proportionally more smaller individuals than otter trawlers, whilst nets were the most size-selective gear for larger sharks. Size-related discarding was observed, with smaller spurdog Squalus acanthias and starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias (&lt; 60 cm total length, L<sub>T</sub> ) usually being discarded. Such size-based selection was not evident for lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula, which was generally landed as bait. Temporal changes in the discard-retention patterns were evident for S. acanthias and porbeagle Lamna nasus, with increased regulatory discarding as management measures became restrictive. A corresponding increase in the proportion of the non-quota M. asterias retained was also observed over the study period. Knowledge of the size-based discard-retention patterns by métier can also help inform on where future studies on discard survival could usefully be undertaken.

AB  - The high economic value of fisheries was historically associated to commercial teleost fishes. Since the 1970s, despite some elasmobranchs becoming an important target or a bycatch, relatively little research has been carried out on this group because of their low economic value. Due to their specific life history characteristics, sharks and rays are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, taking several decades to recover after reaching an overexploitation status. In Portugal elasmobranch fishery results mainly from targeted longlining and bycatch from different fishing gears. During the last decade, the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) of rays have been decreasing, the European Union (EU) banned the capture of some ray species, the Portuguese government implemented both a closed season and a minimum landing size for some rays, and the EU prohibited target fishing for sharks. All these measures may have been highly responsible for the national and local landings reduction. Official landings from the last decade were analyzed, the landed species conservation status was consulted, and structured interviews using a questionnaire were conducted in the most important fishing port in the Portuguese mainland, the port of Sesimbra. Results led us to conclude that fishers’ answers and landings data did not match. It also revealed a lack of awareness by fishers about the state of shark and ray populations, and about some aspects of their biology and ecology, like reproduction season and method. The present study highlights the need to fill in this existing gap in knowledge through the transfer of scientific knowledge and sharing of management responsibilities. Also, we aimed to demonstrate the necessity for awareness and education activities within fishing communities, an essential step to elasmobranch conservation.

AB  - A vessel-based line-transect survey conducted during February 2004 along 1,018km of systematic trackline in the nearshore waters of Bangladesh resulted in 111 ‘on-effort’ cetacean sightings including: Irrawaddy dolphins, Orcaella brevirostris (n=75, mean group size=2.2); finless porpoises, Neophocaena phocaenoides (n=11, mean group size=2.6); Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis (chinensisform; n=6, mean group size=16.2); Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus (n=3, mean group size=36.1); pantropical spotted dolphins, Stenella attenuata (n=1, best, high and low group size estimates=800, 1,100 and 600, respectively); Bryde’s whales, Balaenoptera edeni/brydei (large-form; n=1, three individuals); and unidentified small cetaceans (n=14). Cetacean distribution was closely tied to environmental gradients, with Irrawaddy dolphins and finless porpoises occurring most often in nearshore, turbid, low-salinity waters, IndoPacific humpback dolphins in slightly deeper waters where the colour turned from brown to green and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins and Bryde’s whales in deep, clear, high-salinity waters of the Swatch-of-No-Ground (SoNG), a 900+m-deep submarine canyon that extends to within about 40km of the Sundarbans mangrove forest. A Generalised Additive Model of environmental and presence-absence data indicated that Irrawaddy dolphin distribution was conditionally dependent (p<0.05) on low salinity and shallow depth, which explained 36% of the variance. A distance analysis of Irrawaddy dolphin and finless porpoise sightings resulted in abundance estimates of 5,383 (CV=39.5) and 1,382 (CV=54.8%), respectively. The positive conservation implications of these abundance estimates were tempered by observations of potentially unsustainable bycatch in gillnet fisheries targeting elasmobranches and scarring on bottlenose dolphins consistent with trawl fishery interactions. The nearshore waters of Bangladesh support a taxonomically diverse and relatively abundant cetacean fauna, which can probably be explained by the wide variety of environmental gradients (river-sea and shallow-deep) available within a relatively small area and the enormous biological production driven by extreme fluvial and oceanographic processes. Priority recommendations for future research include: (1) evaluating bycatch levels and the types of fishing gears responsible for incidental kills; (2) investigating the spatial and temporal dynamics of high-density cetacean hotspots; (3) resolving the species and population identities of baleen whales and delphinids occurring in the SoNG; and (4) assessing the abundance, movement patterns and fishery interactions of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins.

AB  - Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) are frequently captured as bycatch on a wide variety of fishing gears, such as pelagic longlines and hook-and-line fisheries, and therefore many species have experienced severe population declines. To reduce elasmobranch bycatch, scientists have begun exploring the effectiveness and potential application of elasmobranch-specific repellents, such as permanent magnets and electropositive metals. For the present study, the behavioural responses of captive small spotted catsharks (Scyliorhinus canicula) and thornback skates (Raja clavata) were observed in response to neodymium-iron-boron (Nd2Fe14B) permanent magnets. Results demonstrate that both R. clavata and S. canicula; (1) significantly avoided the Nd2Fe14B magnets more often in comparison to the control and procedural control and (2) significantly fed from the control and procedural control more often in comparison to the Nd2Fe14B magnets. Data also suggests a relationship between water temperature and the avoidance distance by R. clavata, with closer approaches prior to avoidance occurring in association with water temperatures of ≤12 °C. Additionally, the tail beat frequency associated with the avoidance behaviour of S. canicula was significantly slower (≤9 beats/10 s) in water temperatures of ≤12 °C. The findings from this study agree with previous electrosensory repellent studies, in that elasmobranchs detect and are deterred by permanent magnets however, the present study also demonstrated that there is a correlation between avoidance speed and distance with water temperature. These findings suggest that water temperature may be correlated to magnetic repellent effectiveness and thus warrants further experimentation.

AB  - The composition of teleost and elasmobranch bycatch in two tropical Australian penaeid prawn fisheries was examined using scientific surveys. These covered the major fishing grounds in February and October 1997. On average 82% of the bycatch was teleosts and elasmobranchs, resulting in a high proportion of the bycatch which is unlikely to survive capture. The bycatch is highly diverse (over 350 species of teleosts and elasmobranchs) and dominated by species which occur rarely (75% of species occurred in <10% of trawls) and in low abundance (<10nh−1) and biomass (<1kgh−1). Eight families, including 83 species had to be included to account for 66% of the bycatch weight.Overall the general catch characteristics (e.g. total bycatch weight, catch rate of teleosts and elasmobranchs), bycatch composition and individual species abundances showed significant variation among the regions and between February and October. The variation due to regional differences was much greater than between the two times of year. The inclusion of covariates (depth, acoustic measures of seabed roughness and hardness, commercial prawn catch and commercial fishing effort) explained some of the observed variation but there was still significant regional variation present. The primary implication of the results is the clear need for future monitoring strategies to be stratified with respect to region. Monitoring from a single region or time is unlikely to be representative of the fishery.

AB  - Spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthius) comprises a significant unwanted bycatch on demersal longlines set for halibut and cod in shelf waters of the east and west coasts of North America. In this laboratory study, attacks on baits were tested in the presence of two different rare earth materials (neodymium–iron–boride magnets and cerium mischmetal) believed to deter elasmobranch catch. Experiments were made with spiny dogfish and with Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in pairwise tests of the rare earth materials and inert metal controls. Dogfish attacked and consumed baits tested with cerium mischmetal at a lower frequency than controls. Times to attack the baits were significantly higher in the presence of mischmetal, as were numbers of approaches before first attack. The time differential between mischmetal and control treatments and the number of baits consumed converged with increasing food deprivation (1h, 2d, and 4d), but treatment differences were always significant. Cerium mischmetal appeared to be irritating to dogfish and may disrupt their bait detection and orientation abilities. Magnets also appeared to irritate dogfish but provided no protection for baits in feeding trials. Pacific halibut showed no reaction whatsoever to the rare earth magnets or cerium mischmetal. Mischmetal, therefore, may be useful in reducing spiny dogfish bycatch in the halibut fishery. Disadvantages in using mischmetal in commercial operations are expense, hazardous nature, and relatively rapid hydrolysis in seawater.

AB  - Abundance of marine stocks fluctuates in response to both internal processes (e.g., density dependence) and exogenous drivers, including the physical environment, fishing, and trophodynamic interactions. In the United States, research investigating ecosystem drivers has been focused in data‐rich systems, primarily in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. To develop a more holistic understanding of important ecosystem drivers in the Southeast U.S. continental shelf Large Marine Ecosystem, we applied generalized linear and dynamic linear modeling to investigate the effects of climate and fishing covariates on the relative abundance trends of 71 demersal fish and invertebrate species sampled by a coastal trawl survey during 1990–2013. For the assemblage as a whole, fishing effects predominated over climate effects. In particular, changes in trawling effort within the penaeid shrimp fishery governed abundance trends of bony fishes, invertebrates, and elasmobranchs, a likely result of temporal changes in bycatch mortality. Changes in trawling intensity induced changes in overall community composition and appear to have altered trophic interactions among particular species. Among climate indices investigated, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Western Bermuda High Index were most prevalent in well‐supported dynamic linear models. Observed annual abundance trends were synchronous among some taxonomically related species, highlighting similar responses to exogenous influences based on life history. This study strengthens the foundation for generating hypotheses and advancing ecosystem‐based fisheries research within the region.

AB  - Globally, many of the Elasmobranch species are threatened with extinction due to their vulnerable life history traits, habitat alterations, overexploitation, and climate change. The Spadenose shark, Scoliodon laticaudus Müller & Henle, 1838, is an amphidromous coastal shark that exhibits placental viviparity. The latest IUCN Red List of Threatened species classified S. laticaudus as near threatened (NT) indicating its vulnerability to overfishing. We investigated the genetic population structure of S. laticaudus along the Indian coast using mitochondrial cytochrome C Oxidase 1 (COI), control region, and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (NADH2) markers. Significant genetic differentiation was detected between the east and west coasts of India with the occurrence of two major haplotypes, one dominant along the east coast, and the other along the west coast when analyzed using all the 3 markers. The NADH2 sequences of the predominant haplotype from the west coast recorded 100% identity with sequences of S. laticaudus deposited in NCBI, GenBank. On the contrary, the predominant haplotype from the east coast recorded 100% identity with sequences of Scoliodon cf. laticaudus deposited in NCBI, GenBank. The divergence values of 2% and 3.7% between these haplotypes in the COI and NADH2 genes, respectively, indicate that they can be considered distinct species. Divergence between populations and speciation indicates restricted mixing and gene flow due to the limited dispersal capacity of nearshore elasmobranchs. Natal philopatry, selection on mitochondrial genes due to differential habitat characteristics, and environmental differences between the east and west coasts of India can also be considered as reasons for restricted gene flow and genetic differentiation. Based on the results of the present study, S. laticaudus and the putative S. cf. laticaudus can be managed separately along the Indian coast. A comprehensive investigation based on morphological and molecular information is also warranted to resurrect S. cf. laticaudus as a new species. Besides, restrictions on the fishery and the use of bycatch reduction devices in trawls can be undertaken to conserve this species from further depletion and possible extinction in the future.

AB  - Discard mortality (DM) estimates are vitally important to fisheries management. Commercial fishery DM estimates, for example, can help calculate total fishing mortality and biologically acceptable catch limits. The winter skate, Leucoraja ocellata, is the only species within the US portion of the western North Atlantic that is targeted in the skate wing fishery. However, due primarily to fishery regulations, this species is also routinely discarded at sea when daily quotas are reached. While already examined in mobile fishing gears (i.e. bottom otter trawls), DM has not been addressed for the western North Atlantic skate species captured in the sink gillnet fishery, and a conservative 50% DM is used across the species of the skate complex in the management processes. Given this data gap, we estimate the DM of winter skate in sink gillnets under standard commercial fishing conditions. The study methods employed address the issue of cryptic mortality (drop out of dead skates from the gear and depredation prior to retrieval), which can bias DM estimates low for bycatch in passive gear. The degree of injury sustained during capture and handling was found to be a statistically significant predictor of mortality. Overall mean DM rates reached an asymptote within 170h of captivity, with estimates of 11% and 17% for females and males, respectively. Based on these results, the species appears more resilient to sink gillnet capture and release than previously thought. However, cryptic fishing mortality appeared to be high for extended soak times and likely represents an important focus of future research and management actions.

AB  - The latest stock assessment for the dusky shark, Carcharhinus obscurus, in the western North Atlantic Ocean indicates the population is overfished and experiencing overfishing. As part of a rebuilding plan, the commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks has been prohibited since 2000. Despite this prohibition, dusky sharks are bycatch in multiple fisheries, including the pelagic longline fishery; however, post-release mortality (PRM) rates have not been empirically determined for this gear. Herein we estimated PRM of dusky sharks captured by the US pelagic longline fleet in the western North Atlantic Ocean utilizing pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags. One hundred and twenty three dusky sharks were captured on commercial pelagic longline gear and time on the hook, based on hook timer data, ranged from 0.8 to 8.1 h (4.3 ± 0.28 h). No at-vessel mortality (AVM) was observed for any dusky sharks in this study. Prior to release, 50 PSAT LIFE tags (Lotek Inc.) were attached to dusky sharks (females n = 12, 209 ± 8 cm FL; males n = 4, 198 ± 7 cm FL; unknown sex n = 34, 214 ± 7 cm FL) to assess PRM rates in the pelagic longline fishery during a 30 day attachment period. Forty-three of the 50 deployed tags reported data with deployment times ranging from 1 to 28 days (11.2 ± 9.8 days). Four dusky sharks were in poor condition at release and two individuals suffered PRM, which occurred within two hours after release. Total mortality rate (AVM + PRM) in the current study was 5.1%, far below estimates reported for bottom longline gear (˜97%), and reinforces the notion that PRM should be evaluated by species, season, and gear type.

AB  - In many pelagic longline fisheries around the world there is reluctance to adopt a line weighting regime that will sink fishing gear rapidly to reduce seabird bycatch. In many cases this is due to safety concerns caused by traditional leaded swivels causing serious injuries, and even fatalities, when they fly-back at the crew in the event of line breakage (e.g. from shark bite offs) during line hauling. This paper presents the results of at-sea and on-shore trials to test the safety and operational effectiveness of an alternative line weight (the Safe Lead) which is designed to slide down, or off the line, in the event of a bite-off, significantly reducing danger to the crew from line weights. At-sea trials in South Africa revealed that Safe Leads can reduce the incidence of dangerous fly-backs to very low levels. In at-sea trails, only 4.2% of Safe Lead fly-backs reached the vessel (the remainder fell in the sea) whereas 73.3% of fly-backs by leaded swivels hit the vessel and one hit a crewmen in the head. Simulated bite-off events on shore revealed the degree of slippage (influences whether leads slide but remain on the branch line, or slide off the end of the line) varied as a function of distance from Safe Lead to hook (1–4m range) and tension on the line (20–120kg range). All Safe Lead replicates placed within 2m of the hook slid off the line under all four tension treatments. Under the higher tension categories of 80kg and 120kg, 80% of Safe Leads positioned 3m from the hook position slid off the line after a simulated bite-off (cut-away). High speed photography of fly-backs showed a significant (P<0.05) reduction in the velocity on impact of Safe Leads compared to leaded swivels and an associated >80% reduction in kinetic energy on impact. Our results suggest that Safe Leads are a cost-effective and operationally simple alternative to traditional leaded swivels with significant benefits to crew safety.

AB  - Bycatch may be defined as incidental non-targeted catch which is retained and marketed by fishers. It is one of the greatest and most pervasive threats to marine life and poses a major problem in fishery management. Fishery activities create vast amounts of bycatch, whether on a large industrial scale or a small artisanal scale. The modern fishing gear, poor management practices, and non-implementation of fisheries policies are the major causes of bycatch landings and discards. Bycatch includes dolphins, marine turtles, seabirds, corals, starfish, sharks, juvenile fish, and small fish with little or no commercial value.Asia dominates the world in capture fishery as well as aquaculture industry in terms of quantities. In 2008, over 85 % of all fishers and fish farmers were Asian; China, Indonesia, Japan, India, Philippines, and Myanmar comprised six of the top ten producer countries in capture fishing. Other important fishing nations of Asia are Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. In Asia, marine fisheries production is based almost exclusively on trawl nets, which produce huge amounts of bycatch. According to recent estimates, bycatch in Asia comprises 13–90 % of the total landings, depending on the area, gear, and season of fishing; the highest bycatch rate was found in Bangladesh, whereas the lowest was found in Japan. Despite the high value of bycatch, losses have been minimized by the maximum utilization for human food and animal feed. In some countries of SE Asia, such as Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, etc., all of the bycatch is fully utilized.Asian bycatch is characterized by its rich biodiversity, including a large number of species of fish, shrimp, crab, squid, cuttlefish, and paste shrimp. The number of fish species ranged from 30 to more than a hundred. Generally, a major part of the bycatch is utilized in animal and aquaculture feeds in East Asia, value-added and novel products in SE Asia, and as fresh fish, traditional products, and animal feeds in South Asia. In SE Asia, product development is based on the availability of bycatch species. Small pelagic fish like sardines, scads, and croakers are often salted, dried, and marketed widely as a low-cost source of protein. Minced fish meat with low gel strength is also used in a variety of indigenous products, usually as a binder in deep-fried fish cakes, rolls, etc. SE Asia has achieved the greatest success in utilizing the bycatch and discard, and previous bycatch has attained the status of target species as a result of market-driven demand. The fish products developed from bycatch in Asian countries range from traditional to value-added products. The processing of these products involves simple methods used at home or at the cottage industry level to high technology being used for large-scale production. The products prepared in different countries depend largely on the cultural, social, religious, and traditional values of the country. These products can be broadly categorized as: (i) cured, (ii) fermented, (iii) hydrolyzed, (iv) minced, (v) dehydrated protein-rich foods, (vi) canned, and (vii) miscellaneous products.Technological advances are almost non-existent for bycatch utilization. The techniques adopted are based mainly on simple, traditional, and cost-effective methods in majority of the Asian countries, except those of Japan, where technological advances have been made for the development of value-added fishery products using high-value fish and sophisticated equipment, though the quantity of bycatch is quite low.

AB  - 1. This study compared the catch rates of targeted dolphinfish or mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus), and sea turtles and other fish bycatch in a shallow‐set Costa Rican longline fishery using 14/0 circle hooks with and without a 10° offset. The effect of hook offset on hooking location and injury in captured sea turtles, specifically if the hooking was external, in the mouth, or in the esophagus was also evaluated. 2. Results were compared from six trips totalling 33 876 hooks with squid (Dosidicus gigas) used as bait. In total, mahimahi catch‐per‐unit‐effort (CPUE, expressed as number caught per 1000 hooks) was similar between hook types (CPUE∼52). 3. Olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) were caught on all 42 sets. In total, 640 olive ridley turtles were caught and released alive. There were no significant differences in the number of sea turtles caught between hooks with and without an offset (CPUE∼19) nor between hook type and anatomical hooking location, suggesting similar levels of injury for turtles caught on each hook type. 4. These data suggest that a 10° offset on 14/0 circle hooks does not confer any selective advantages over hooks with no offset with respect to capture rates of mahimahi, sea turtles, sharks, or pelagic stingrays in a shallow set pelagic longline fishery.

AB  - Our research aims to identify longline fishing gear modifications that can improve fishing selectivity and reduce incidental capture of non-target species. Catch rates and anatomical hook locations (AHL) were compared when using a 14/0 standard “control” circle hook with a 0° offset and an experimental “appendage” hook in a Costa Rican longline fishery. With the appendage, the maximum dimension of the appendage hook was increased by 10% and the minimum dimension of the hook by 19%. A total of 1,811 marine animals were captured during five fishing trips. By taxonomic groups, sea turtles represented the largest total catch (27%), followed by sharks (26%), rays (25%), mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus) (12%), and tunas and billfish (10%). Non-target and discard species, such as rays and sea turtles, accounted for over half of the total catch. Catch per unit effort (CPUE; number of individuals per 1,000 hooks) was higher with control hooks compared to appendage hooks for all species’ categories except rays; appendage hooks caught 52% fewer sea turtles and 23% fewer tunas and billfish than standard hooks, which represents a significant reduction in bycatch of endangered and other species. No differences were found in the AHL for sea turtles, suggesting use of the appendage may not incur additional advantages regarding turtles’ post-release survivorship. Despite lower catch rates for marketable species, such as sharks and mahimahi, use of the appendage resulted in dramatic reductions in catch rates of sea turtles. The results suggest that large scale adoption of hooks with a significantly wider hook dimension could be an effective conservation measure to maintain marine biodiversity while allowing for continued fishing.

AB  - Bycatch and mortality in fishing gear poses a conservation threat worldwide to many marine species. Resource managers and conservation scientists face challenges in identifying bycatch mitigation solutions that work for multiple taxa while maintaining acceptable levels of target fish catch. The most successful mitigation measures to address bycatch concerns are those that (1) minimize bycatch with limited or no impact on target species catch, (2) have been proven through at-sea experimental research, (3) are practical, affordable, and easy to use, and (4) do not risk the safety of the fishing vessel crew or the bycaught animals. We conducted a review of mitigation measures in fishing gears that target tuna and tuna-like species and that either prevent capture of non-target species in fishing gear or facilitate alive post-capture release, and evaluated these against 4 defined criteria: effective, proven, practical, and safe. This paper outlines the most effective bycatch mitigation measures, as based upon the best scientific information available, in commercial and artisanal pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries, specifically those that target tuna and tuna-like species. This review includes information on gear and operational changes to fishing practices that reduce bycatch for protected and threatened species across taxonomic groups, with a focus on cetaceans, sea turtles, seabirds, sharks, and istiophorid billfishes. The information provided can guide future research and management efforts in Regional Fisheries Management Organizations that are specific to tuna fishing and that aim to minimize impacts to protected and threatened species while maintaining viable commercial fisheries.

AB  - Fishes are often caught as bycatch on longlines and subsequently discarded. The behavioural response of fishes to longline capture is poorly understood, although it may be linked to the magnitude of the physiological stress response, and, ultimately, contribute to stress-induced mortality. We used accelerometers, video cameras, and hook timers to analyse the behavioural response of 13 subtropical teleost and elasmobranch species to experimental longline capture in The Bahamas. We found that, across all species and species groups, fight intensity during a capture event was best described by a negative linear and positive quadratic response. Nurse sharks and tiger sharks had lower fight intensity values and exhibited less steepness in their quadratic response during the first 10 min of capture than other species, particularly blacktip and Caribbean reef sharks. Nurse sharks also exhibited the most consistent fight intensity during the entire capture event compared to other shark species, particularly the blacknose shark. Generally, obligate ram ventilators and mixed ventilators exhibited higher steepness in fight intensity trajectories than buccal/spiracular pumpers, which had more consistent, lower fight intensity values. Behavioural responses to longline capture are species specific but may be linked to distinct evolutionary traits such as respiratory mode.

AB  - Elasmobranchs have become an important element of the bycatch in the fisheries worldwide and an important resource for most of Argentine trawl fisheries. This work is the first analysis of the diversity of batoid fishes in the bycatch of the Argentine coastal fisheries. Between July 1998 and June 2000, an onboard observer program was carried out and 89 tows were monitored. A total of 1354 batoid specimens were obtained from the bycatch and 11 different species were identified: Atlantoraja castelnaui, A. cyclophora, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dipturus chilensis, Discopyge tschudii, Myliobatis goodei, Psammobatis bergi, P. extenta, Rioraja agassizi, Sympterygia bonapartii and Zapteryx brevirostris. The electric ray D. tschudii and the sand skate P. extenta were the most abundant species and were always discarded. The commercial capture of batoids was estimated at 33.6kgh−1 and showed no clear pattern of temporal variation.

AB  - The relative abundance and distribution of sharks caught by the artisanal fishery was determined for the most important offshore islands of Venezuela (Los Roques, Las Aves and La Blanquilla). Data were collected from January 1997 to October 1998, corresponding to 123 fishing days targeting sharks using bottom longline. We also present the results of 10 days of fishing activities targeting tunas and marlins by the same fleet using pelagic longline, in order to determine the importance of the shark bycatch in these fisheries around the offshore islands. A total of 15 shark species representing five families were captured during the study period. The catch composition and CPUE values expressed in weight and number showed that the most abundant species were Carcharhinus perezi and C. falciformis for Los Roques Archipelago and La Blanquilla Island, while C. perezi and Ginglymostoma cirratum were more common in Las Aves Archipelago. In Los Roques Archipelago, C. perezi and C. falciformis were most common during the second half of the year; a similar trend was observed for the rest of the shark species caught by the fishery. A positive relationship was observed between CPUE and fishing depth in the case of C. perezi and C. falciformis off Los Roques Archipelago: CPUE by weight increases with depth, while CPUE by number decreases with depth. The main factors that could be determining shark abundance and their spatial-temporal distribution are the characteristics of the ecosystem, depth, and biological characteristics such as birth, mating season and migratory patterns of the species.

AB  - The assessment of fisheries-related effects on protected species, such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), is often hampered by a lack of historical catch information. In the present study, historical catch estimates derived from interviews with fishers operating in the Western Australian Temperate Demersal Gill-net and Demersal Longline Fisheries were matched with fishing effort data reported in statutory fishing returns. Catch estimates obtained from interviewed fishers were extrapolated to account for total catch in two different ways, resulting in mean (95% confidence intervals) estimates of 1232 (476–2245) and 1039 (505–2096) white sharks caught between 1988 and 2012. These estimates were then used to reconstruct catches over a 59-year period, from the start of commercial gillnetting in the mid-1950s. The reconstructed catch trend reflected the history of gill-net fishing effort, peaking in the late 1980s at a level approximately fourfold greater than the estimated catch of ~30 sharks year–1 in 2014. More than one-third of fishers interviewed expressed doubts about the accuracy of self-reported white shark catch data, a requirement of current legislation. Given the benefits of reporting data from protected species bycatch, efforts to accurately record this information should be continued and improved.

AB  - Flatfishes represent an important resource in Portuguese fisheries. Although flatfish landings represent a low percentage of total fish weight landed, their importance is higher when commercial value is considered (11%). Official data on flatfish landings from 1992 to 2005 for all landing ports in Portugal were analysed, together with vessel characteristics, in order to detect patterns in flatfish fisheries. Fleet characteristics were heterogeneous, but most of the vessels were multi-gear. Three landing profiles were identified in the flatfish fishery, and the target species of these métiers showed variation in space and in time. Small vessels caught species that occur in coastal areas, mainly soles, bastard sole, flounder, turbot and brill, and usually also presented high landings of octopuses, cuttlefish and rays. Megrims and spotted flounder were caught with others species, like small pelagic fishes and seabreams by coastal trawlers. For this fleet component, catches of flatfish were usually bycatch. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to analyse flatfish landings (LPUE, landings per unit effort and landings in terms of value) between 1992 and 2005 and to evaluate their relationships with several variables. The main effects in the models included year, month, landing port, vessel length class and total landings (kg). The models explained between 15% and 60% of the variability of the LPUE, and 46% to 82% of the variability of landing value, for the flatfish groups considered, with the most important factors being landing port, vessel length class, month, total landing (kg) and landing port: vessel length interaction. These results suggest high spatial and temporal variability. The results of this study may have implications for fishery management, because the LPUE was highest during the important periods of flatfish life cycles, like the spawning season. This fishing pattern has a negative impact on the stocks because of increased fishing pressure during a sensitive period for these species. The adoption of spatial and temporal closures should be implemented.

AB  - Hammerhead sharks are represented by four species in India's marine fishery – Sphyrna lewini, Sphyrna mokarran, Sphyrna zygaena and Eusphyra blochii. This paper describes the hammerhead shark fishery in India during 2007–2018 and summarizes observations on the biology of S. lewini exploited along the Indian coast. Hammerhead sharks are caught by trawl nets, gillnets, seines and line gear, mostly as bycatch. Annual average landing of hammerhead sharks during 2007–18 was 639 t, with a low of 290 t in 2018, of which S, lewini was the dominant species, comprising 95% of landings. Hammerhead sharks formed nearly 1.31% of the total elasmobranch landings. About 54% of hammerhead sharks were landed by trawlers. Length range of S. lewini in regular landings was 36–300 cm total length (TL). The dominant size class was 30–100 cm TL; 79.5% of males and 83.2% of females measured between 40 and 100 cm TL. Length–weight relationship was derived as W = 0.0218*(L)2.634 and W = 0.0131*(L)2.769 for males and females, respectively. Overall sex ratio (F: M) was 1.3:1; below 100 cm TL, the sex ratio was skewed in favour of females. The length at first maturity of males was estimated as 168 cm. The length at first maturity of females was estimated at 239.6 cm. Fecundity ranged from 12–40, size at birth was 36–45 cm TL. Bony fishes were the preferred prey, followed by cephalopods. The S. lewini landings in India are dominated by juveniles and threatens sustainability of the stock. Capture of juvenile sharks can be excluded to a considerable extent through strict implementation of minimum legal size of capture, and a conservative minimum legal size of 220 cm is suggested for this species in Indian waters. Identification of recurring juvenile aggregation grounds, their spatio‐temporal closures, gear restrictions and greater stakeholder awareness could lead to conservation of the resource and a sustainable fishery.

AB  - Fishing with modified gillnets was conducted to elucidate their potential for reducing shark bycatch. Experimental fishing focused on two commercial fisheries, Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus). The modification took the form of increasing the gillnet tension using larger floats on the head-rope and increasing the lead-core lead-line weight. Gillnet mesh sizes were 7.2cm (spot fishery) and 7.6 and 10.2cm (Spanish mackerel fishery). Gillnet selectivity of the four most commonly encountered shark species were fitted to fork-length distribution data using the SELECT method. There was no significant difference in the catch rate of the target species between control and modified gillnets for all mesh sizes used. Catch rates of some shark species were significantly reduced in modified gillnets. Model deviance values indicated good fits to the data for blacknose (Carcharhinus acronotus), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus) and bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) sharks with lowest deviance values (i.e., best fit) generally associated with the normal scale (spread proportional to mesh size) form. The selectivity results demonstrated that all life stages of Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) and blacknose sharks were available to the gillnets. The mesh selectivity of bonnethead sharks was largely uniform due to their exaggerated cepholaphoil that resulted in the majority being hammer-wrapped. Further, capture data indicated a dominance of large juveniles and adult bonnethead sharks resulting in poor model fits. The capture mortality rate for all shark species was high (78.6%) with higher mortality rates associated with heightened locomotor performance and wrapping as an entanglement mode. These results demonstrated that modified gillnets have the potential to reduce shark bycatch, particularly for those species for which wrapping was the primary entanglement mode.

AB  - Several species of elasmobranchs are commonly found as bycatch or discard in both artisanal and industrial fisheries. In particular, in the Mediterranean Sea, only few studies are available about bycatch and discards of elasmobranchs in artisanal coastal fisheries. In this study, we focus our attention on elasmobranch catches in a trammel net fishery targeting cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in the southeastern Ionian coast of Sicily (central Mediterranean Sea). In 2017, during the peak S. officinalis fishing season (February–May), four species of the infraclass Batoidea (Raja radula, Dasyatis pastinaca, Torpedo marmorata and Torpedo torpedo) constituted the total elasmobranch catches of the 16 survey days. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of T. torpedo, in both number of specimens and biomass terms, showed the highest value, accounting for about 50% of the total. Except for the three larger specimens of R. radula (1.7% of R. radula specimens caught), all elasmobranchs were discarded. An ANOVA showed significant differences (P<0.05) between monthly CPUE values of the four species; while, for each species, the chi-square test failed (P>0.05) to show a significant difference in monthly CPUE values. Average disc width of the specimens caught showed the overall presence of a large number of juveniles. Chi-square test for sex ratio showed a significant difference (P<0.05) only for T. torpedo. For D. pastinaca, survival rate was equal to 0. Local traditions play an essential role in fishermen’s choice to discard or retain fishes. Monitoring the impact of fishing on populations of these vulnerable or potentially vulnerable species is of fundamental importance for the development of management strategies.

AB  - The sustainable mitigation of human–wildlife conflicts has become a major societal and environmental challenge globally. Among these conflicts, large marine predators feeding on fisheries catches, a behaviour termed “depredation,” has emerged concomitantly with the expansion of the world’s fisheries. Depredation poses threats to both the socio‐economic viability of fisheries and species conservation, stressing the need for mitigation. This review synthesizes the extent and socio‐ecological impacts of depredation by sharks and marine mammals across the world, and the various approaches used to minimize it. Depredation was reported in 214 fisheries between 1979 and 2019 (70% post‐2000) and affected fleets from 44 countries, in all sectors (commercial, artisanal and recreational), and in all major fishing techniques (nets, traps and hook‐and‐lines). A total of 68 predator species were involved in depredation (20 odontocetes, 21 pinnipeds and 27 sharks), and most (73%) were subject to either by‐catch and/or retaliatory killing from fishers when interacting with gear. Impacts on fishers were primarily associated with catch losses and gear damage but often lacked assessments. Deterrence was a major mitigation approach but also the least effective. Gear modifications or behavioural adaptation by fishers were more promising. This review highlights the need for improved monitoring, and interdisciplinary and integrated research to quantify the determinants and impacts of depredation in the socio‐ecological dimension. More importantly, as the conflict is likely to escalate, efforts directed towards changing perceptions and integrating knowledge through adaptive co‐management are raised as key directions towards coexistence between fisheries and large marine predators.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management is widely recognized as the path to achieve sustainability of ecosystem services. Tuna Fisheries Management Organizations have incorporated an ecosystem approach into their mandate, but their decision-making process essentially relies on individual stock assessments. This study investigates possible unintended consequences of management measures that primarily focus on single target species. In 2016, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted a plan for rebuilding yellowfin tuna stock. We examined the impacts that this measure might have had on the fishing strategy of purse seine fleets and on silky shark mortality, their main elasmobranch bycatch. The economic dimension of this possible ecological impact was also explored. Logbook and observer data from the French fleet, coupled with IOTC data from Spain, Seychelles and Mauritius, were used. After the implementation of the measure, an increase on the number of fish aggregating device (FAD) sets and an expansion of the fishing effort were observed. These resulted in a 35% increase on silky shark bycatch for the French fleet and a 18% increase for all fleets combined. Based on the estimated catches, the mean forgone consumptive value of silky shark bycatch was evaluated at US$ 1.6 million. Taking the conservation value into account, the social cost of this forgone ecosystem service could increase up to USD 14 million. This work is a first exploration into to the socioeconomic dimension of trade-offs between the use of FADs in tuna purse seine fisheries and shark bycatch and can be applied to other FAD-associated species.

AB  - A combination of fisheries dependent and independent data was used to assess the vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark to pelagic longline fisheries. The Brazilian tuna longline fleet, operating in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic, is used as a case study. Fisheries dependent data include information from logbooks (from 1999 to 2011) and on-board observers (2004 to 2010), totaling 65,277 pelagic longline sets. Fisheries independent data were obtained from 8 oceanic whitetip sharks tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags in the area where longline fleet operated. Deployment periods varied from 60 to 178 days between 2010 and 2012. Tagging and pop-up sites were relatively close to each other, although individuals tended to travel long distances before returning to the tagging area. Some degree of site fidelity was observed. High utilization hotspots of tagged sharks fell inside the area under strongest fishing pressure. Despite the small sample size, a positive correlation between tag recorded information and catch data was detected. All sharks exhibited a strong preference for the warm and shallow waters of the mixed layer, spending on average more than 70% of the time above the thermocline and 95% above 120 m. Results indicate that the removal of shallow hooks on longline gear might be an efficient mitigation measure to reduce the bycatch of this pelagic shark species. The work also highlights the potential of tagging experiments to provide essential information for the development of spatio-temporal management measures.

AB  - Several pelagic fish species are known to regularly associate with floating objects in the open ocean, including commercially valuable species. The tuna purse seine industry takes advantage of this associative behavior and has been increasingly deploying free-drifting man-made floating objects, also known as fish aggregating devices (FADs). Using passive acoustic telemetry, this study describes the associative dynamics of the main targeted tropical tuna species (Thunnus albacares, T. obesus and Katsuwonus pelamis), as well as three major bycatch species, silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) and oceanic triggerfish (Canthidermis maculata). Short-term excursions away from the FADs were frequently performed by all tuna species as well by silky sharks. These excursions were characterized by a marked diel pattern, mainly occurring during nighttime. Rainbow runners and oceanic triggerfish were much more present at the FADs and rarely performed excursions. Average continuous residence times (CRTs) ranged from 6 days, for silky shark, up to 25 days for bigeye tuna. Similar to silky shark, average CRTs for skipjack tuna and oceanic triggerfish were less than 10 days. For yellowfin tuna and rainbow runner, CRTs averaged 19 and 16 days, respectively. Bigeye and yellowfin tuna remained associated to a single drifting FAD for a record of 55 days and 607 km traveled.

AB  - Catch and effort data from 14,835 longline sets conducted by foreign tuna longline vessels chartered by Brazil, from 2004 to 2010, were analyzed aiming at assessing the size, distribution and the relative abundance of the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) exhibited a gradual increase, from 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks, in 2004, the first year of the time series, up to 0.13, in 2007. In 2008, however, the CPUE increased sharply, reaching 0.43, dropping, then, back to 0.15, in 2010. A CPUE standardization was performed using a delta-GLM approach, but the standardized index of abundance did not differ significantly from the nominal CPUE. The models indicated that the catches of oceanic whitetip sharks are higher for the Spanish fishing strategy, which is characterized by the deployment of hooks at shallower depths. These results indicate that the use of deep longline hooks (>100m) may help to mitigate the bycatch of this species.

AB  - The Joseph Bonaparte Gulf (JBG) banana prawn subfishery is an important component of Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). However, the species composition of the large volumes of bycatch caught in this region is poorly known. We sampled the prawn trawl bycatch of the JBG from 53 commercial trawls over two years. These samples contained 195 taxa from 85 families; 117 teleost taxa contributing 90.9% of the total biomass, 68 invertebrate taxa (7.7% of biomass), six species of elasmobranchs (1.3% of biomass) and three species of sea snakes (<1% of biomass). The species composition of this bycatch is distinctly different from that of other tropical regions, including the neighbouring Gulf of Carpentaria in the NPF. The estimated 4934t of bycatch taken annually in the JBG consists mainly of teleosts (4486t), invertebrates (382t) and small elasmobranchs (66t), with around 4000t (81.6% of the total biomass) coming from just six teleost families: Synondontidae (17.7%), Rhinoprenidae (15.9%), Trichiuridae (14.1%), Sciaenidae (12.3%), Engraulidae (10.9%) and Polynemidae (10.7%). Of the other taxa, around 58% occurred in less than 10% of trawls and 28% occurred in only one trawl. Eight species have never been recorded from other bycatch studies in northern Australia. The total bycatch take and its teleost component varied seasonally, while some abundant species also showed seasonal and diel differences in their catch rates and size composition. The data collected in this study will be the basis for a long-term bycatch monitoring program in the region. This will improve the accuracy of quantitative risk assessments used to demonstrate the sustainability of bycatch populations impacted by fishing in northern Australia.

AB  - In the Northeast Atlantic, elasmobranchs are a common bycatch in many fisheries, including demersal trawls, longlines, or gillnets and many countries do not have regulations or any control over the amount taken. In the Mid Atlantic, the Azores EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone), small-scale fishing operations, artisanal and hook-and-line fishing methods are responsible for part of local total landed elasmobranch biomass, although some species are specifically focused and severely harvested by international large-scale fleets. This work provides a review and analysis of the commercial elasmobranch fisheries in the Azores EEZ, and its evolution over the last two decades, highlighting management priorities, taking into account the Northeast Atlantic elasmobranch fisheries status. In the Mid-Atlantic, elasmobranch fisheries mainly target 4 species, that are usually landed as bycatch: the tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) and the thornback ray (Raja clavata), captured mainly by local demersal artisanal fisheries, the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) captured by a more industrialised fleet, including those from foreign nations. Considering elasmobranchs life history traits and fishery history, caution is advised in the development of a management strategy focusing on these species, considering the Northeast Atlantic context and regional, local and national interests.

AB  - Within the Ecosystem-based fisheries management framework, we evaluated the changes over time in bycatch species of the European tuna purse-seine fishery operating in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Bycatch data was collected during two scientific observer programs conducted in the late 1990s and in the late 2000s. Over these two time periods, we compared the temporal trends in bycatch species composition, the probability of occurrence of functional groups per fishing set, the spatio-temporal species richness and the potential impact on several species listed in the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The analyses were performed separately on the two main fishing modes of the fleet, i.e. sets on free-swimming school sets and on fish aggregating devices (FADs). Owing data quality constraints, we did not estimate bycatch rates. Ours results showed that the species composition of sharks caught on FADs decreased over time. The total species richness was higher for FAD sets than for free-swimming school sets (87 vs. 61 species respectively), such difference is common between fishing modes worldwide. For the species catalogued as threatened by the IUCN, in free-swimming schools, 25.5 % of the species caught during first period increased to 30.4 % during second period, while for FAD-fishing the increase was from 28.8 % during first period to 34.9 % in second period. Ours findings suggest that tropical tuna purse-seine fisheries should include ecosystem-based governance of bycatch. Effective tuna management will require a combination of technological improvements for mitigating incidental catch of vulnerable species, best use of byproduct species, regulations in fishing practices and in spatial distribution of fishing effort, and international agreements that, together, can monitor and manage bycatch, reducing the negative fishing effects on the epipelagic ecosystem biodiversity.

AB  - Discarding is considered globally among the most important issues for fisheries management. The recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy establishes a landing obligation for the species which are subject to catch limits and, in the Mediterranean, for species which are subject to Minimum Conservation Reference Size (MCRS) as defined in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006. Additionally, several other initiatives aim to reduce unwanted catches of target and bycatch species, including species of conservation concern. This raises the need to study discarding patterns of (mainly) these species. In this work we collated a considerable amount of historical published information on discard ratios and lengths at discarding for species caught in EU Mediterranean bottom trawl fisheries. The main aim was to summarize the available historical records and make them more accessible for scientific and managerial needs, as well as to try identifying patterns in discarding. We show discard ratios and lengths at which 50% of the individuals were discarded (L50) for 15 species (9 bony fishes, three crustacean decapods, and three elasmobranchs). Discard ratios were usually low for target species such as hake, red mullets and highly commercial shrimps and exemptions from the landing obligation under the de minimis rules could be sought in several cases. Discard ratios were usually higher for commercial bycatch species. Discarding is affected by a combination of factors and for a given species, especially for non-target ones, discards are likely to fluctuate within a fishery, across seasons, years, and regions. For most species considered, L50s were lower than the MCRS (when in place) and length at first maturity. L50s of target species, such as hake, were very small due to the existence of market demands for small sized individuals. However, for species of low demand, like horse mackerels, a higher retention size was observed, often exceeding MCRS. Lengths at discarding are affected by legal provisions, market demands but also by biological, population, and ecological traits. Understanding the factors that affect discarding constitutes the starting point for designing mitigation measures and management plans to reduce discards and improve the sustainability of the stocks.

AB  - Over the last few years, data on seasonal and interannual variations in the biological parameters of picked dogfish in the Black Sea have been limited, which hampers the understanding of the current status of this vulnerable species and management options. We studied the size and sex structure, as well as the link between the length and weight of picked dogfish by sex in the Western Black Sea to distinguish the variability of biological parameters. For this purpose, picked dogfish specimens were collected by a bottom trawl research survey for turbot during the autumn and spring seasons of 2014–2019. The number of picked dogfish specimens collected from 385 trawls, was 178. The most abundant bycatch of picked dogfish was recorded in late autumn, with a maximum in 2018. Although spring samples were scarce, seasonality in the sex ratio was observed and the percentage of females tended to increase in the spring bycatch. The factor “sex” determined the differences in weight and the female specimens were heavier than the males during the two seasons. Seasonal changes in the growth patterns of both sexes were observed. Statistically significant interannual variability in size was established in autumn when the most abundant samples were collected. Fluctuations in size and sex structure reflect the complex behavior of this migratory predator species.

AB  - Beam trawl fisheries for sole are characterised by large amounts of unwanted bycatch (i.e. discards) consisting of fish below the Minimum Conservation Reference Size, unwanted fish due to low commercial value or lack of quota, and benthic invertebrates. In order to reduce the quantity of discards, a substantial part of the Dutch beam trawl fleet was allowed to replace the conventional tickler chain beam trawl (BT) with the pulse trawl (PT) on an experimental basis. The PT used electrical stimulation to immobilise and capture fish. Here we study whether pulse trawling reduced the amount of discards by comparing catch rates of landings and discards of BT and PT in the period 2009–2018 for a wide range of species. The PT caught (kg.km-2) significantly more marketable sized sole (Solea solea, 48 %), turbot (Psetta maxima, 8 %), brill (Scophthalmus rhombus, 28 %) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus, 95 %), and significantly less marketable sized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa, −16 %), cod (Gadus morhua, −32 %) and gurnards (−12 %). No significant difference was found for dab (Limanda limanda), gadoids, or rays and sharks. Among discards, the PT caught more undersized sole (27 %) and whiting (42 %) but less undersized plaice (−21 %), dab (−19 %) and grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus, −31 %). The observed differences in species selectivity are discussed in relation to the response of fish to bottom trawl gear and the effects of pulse stimulation. For the benthic invertebrates Ophiuroidae, bivalves and crabs the PT caught fewer individuals (between −38 % and −57 %). No significant difference was observed in sea urchins and sea stars. Overall, this study shows that the transition from the BT to PT resulted in a 36 % decrease (95 % prediction interval: 31–42 %) in discards (kg.hour-1).

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is a biodiversity hotspot where intense fishing pressure is associated with high bycatch rates of protected species (sea turtles and cetaceans) and top predators (sharks). Since the conservation of these species has become a priority, fishery scientists are faced with the challenge of reducing incidental catch, which entails high rates of mortality. Among the species threatened by fishing activities, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is a charismatic species considered as "vulnerable" at the global scale. In the Mediterranean Sea trawl nets are the gears with the highest probability of catching protected species incidentally. A new flexible Turtle Excluder Device (TED) was tested for the first time on commercial bottom trawlers to assess its effectiveness in reducing bycatch in the Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of the total catches of the hauls made with and without the TED showed that the difference in terms of weight was not significant. The catch of the main commercial species showed similar rates without a significant loss of size (i.e. total length) with the exception of the largest anglerfish (Lophius spp.). The bycatch of control nets included mostly rays and sharks, but never turtles, although the authors learned from the crews of other vessels operating in the same areas at the time of the trials that they had caught some loggerhead turtles. Our study demonstrates that TED scan be adopted without significantly affecting commercial catch. This informs fishers and managers for a practical and effective means that may reduce the bycatch of threatened species in coastal Mediterranean demersal multispecies fisheries. The measures involving gear modifications require significant investment but they are technically feasible and are capable of improving the conservation prospects of these endangered species. Besides ensuring normal earnings, the TED induced a significant reduction of debris and litter in the codend, thus reducing catch sorting time and improving catch quality.

AB  - Neoheterocotyle robii n. sp. is described from the gills of four female Rhinobatos annulatus Müller & Henle caught as bycatch during routine demersal research trawls off the Southern Cape coast of South Africa. The new species can be distinguished from all other members of Neoheterocotyle Hargis, 1955 by the morphology of the accessory piece associated with the male copulatory organ, the presence of a distinct horseshoe-shaped muscle associated with the male copulatory organ and the presence of a sclerotised structure in the proximal portion of the vagina. This is the first Neoheterocotyle species described from South African waters.

AB  - Information about the spatial distribution of bycatch species and their spatial overlap with the target species is essential for fisheries management. The present study used fishery-dependent data (vessel monitoring systems, logbooks and official daily landings) to study the spatial distribution and overlap between black scabbardfish Aphanopus carbo and leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus taken by the longline fishery operating off mainland Portugal. The geostatistical method kriging was applied to estimate the distribution of the leafscale gulper shark in relation to black scabbardfish and thus assess the impact of the fishery on the leafscale gulper shark. Results indicate that in fishing grounds where the black scabbardfish is more abundant, the relative occurrence of deepwater sharks is reduced. These findings have implications for alternative management measures to be adopted in this particular fishery, particularly where it concerns the minimization of deepwater shark bycatch.

AB  - Population declines in shark species have been reported on local and global scales, with overfishing, habitat destruction and climate change posing severe threats. The lack of species-specific baseline data on ecology and distribution of many sharks, however, makes conservation measures challenging. Here, we present a fisheries-independent shark survey from the Fiji Islands, where scientific knowledge on locally occurring elasmobranchs is largely still lacking despite the location's role as a shark hotspot in the Pacific. Juvenile shark abundance in the fishing grounds of the Ba Estuary (north-western Viti Levu) was assessed with a gillnet- and longline-based survey from December 2015 to April 2016. A total of 103 juvenile sharks identified as blacktip <i>Carcharhinus limbatus</i> (<i>n</i> = 57), scalloped hammerhead <i>Sphyrna lewini</i> (<i>n</i> = 35), and great hammerhead <i>Sphyrna mokarran</i> (<i>n</i> = 11) sharks were captured, tagged, and released. The condition of umbilical scars (68% open or semihealed), mean sizes of individuals (±<i>SD</i>) (<i>C. limbatus:</i> 66.5 ± 3.8 cm, <i>S. lewini:</i> 51.8 ± 4.8 cm, <i>S. mokarran</i> 77.4 ± 2.8 cm), and the presence of these species over recent years (based on fishermen interviews), suggest that the Ba Estuary area is a critical habitat for multiple species that are classified as "Near Threatened" or "Endangered." Specifically, the area likely acts as a parturition ground over the studied period, and potentially as a subsequent nursery area. We identified subareas of high abundance and found that temperature, salinity and depth acted as small-scale environmental drivers of shark abundance. The data suggests a tendency for species-specific spatial use, both horizontally (i.e., between sampling areas) and vertically (i.e., across the water column). These results enhance the understanding of shark ecology in Fiji and provide a scientific basis for the implementation of local conservation strategies that contribute to the protection of these threatened species.

AB  - The Pacific coast of Colombia is characterized by mangrove ecosystems which play a crucial role as possible nurseries for juvenile sharks. However, trophic food webs from coastal ecosystems are heavily disturbed by increased fishing pressure, which affects numerous shark species. In this region of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), fisheries' data from coastal areas are scarce and unspecific, as most sharks from artisanal fisheries are landed decapitated and finless, making their morphological identification difficult. For the establishment and implementation of effective regional conservation and management policies, information on the diversity and population dynamics of shark species is crucial. We therefore sequenced the mitochondrial NADH2 gene of 696 samples taken from fishermen's landings of shark's bycatch along the Colombian north Pacific coast. We were able to identify 14 species of sharks, two of the most abundant species were <i>Sphyrna lewini</i> and <i>Carcharhinus falciformis</i>, both evaluated on IUCN the Red List of Threatened species (Critically Endangered and Vulnerable) and CITES regulated. We found low genetic diversity in the sampled area increasing the concern for both species in the region, even more considering that the majority of individuals were juveniles. Our results showed the importance of genetic markers for first population genetic insights as a complementary tool during the decision-making process in management plans. For this specific region, strategies such as the delimitation of conservation priority areas or the regulation of fishing gears could help improve the sustainability of shark populations in the Colombian Pacific.

AB  - Concerns regarding quantifying fishing impacts on rarely-encountered bycatch species in a demersal fish trawl fishery in north-western Australia have raised issues with, 1) uncertainty associated with extrapolated estimates from low levels of coverage by human observers, and 2) appropriate minimum levels of observer coverage. This study used data collected from a very high level of independent observations (85% coverage, n = 2127 trawls) using electronic monitoring (EM) to determine the uncertainty of extrapolated estimates of chondrichthyan, cetacean and reptile bycatch at different levels of observer coverage. The distribution of extrapolated estimates of total numbers for rarely-encountered bycatch (i.e. dolphins and hammerhead sharks) was asymmetric, with a higher tendency for overestimation at lower levels of observer coverage (≤ 25%). Conversely, the minimum level of observer coverage required to achieve a reasonable level of precision (± 30% or lower) for rarely-encountered species would need to be very high (≥90%). Combining the interaction rates of rarely-encountered species (i.e. via statutory logbook validation) reduces the minimum level of observer coverage required to an achievable level (~64%), whilst maintaining relatively accurate (± 25%) quantitative bycatch estimates for management purposes. Future programs need to consider that, in contrast to the infrequent presence of human observers, EM with cameras installed to monitor all fishing activity will effectively negate the need to assume that fishing practices are equivalent between observed and unobserved events. Hence, analysis of data collected by human observers may need to account for additional biases and/or imprecision along with the marked increase in uncertainty associated with lower levels of observer coverage.

AB  - To improve bycatch mitigation of chondrichthyans, reptiles and cetaceans for a tropical demersal fish-trawl fishery, species-specific responses to bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) were investigated using both in situ subsurface and onboard observations. There are few, if any, studies that have determined mitigation performances of BRDs from subsurface interactions for these species, as most are rarely encountered and thus require substantial levels of observer coverage for robust assessments. This study combined in-net and onboard (774 day trawls and 1320 day trawl hours of subsurface observer coverage) electronic monitoring on all fish-trawl vessels (n = 3) to compare bycatch mitigation performances among nine megafauna groups, based on escape rates and interaction durations for three BRDs over 6 months (June to December 2012). Overall, 26.9% of day trawls had no megafauna interactions and 38.3% of the 1826 interactions escaped, with most in rapid time (91.4% in ≤ 5 min). The upward inclined exclusion grid significantly improved the escape proportions for most chondrichthyans by 20–30%. All BRDs were highly effective in reducing reptile (turtles and seasnakes) bycatch, but irrelevant for the few sawfish (n = 13) that readily entangled in the anterior of the net. Cetacean (bottlenose dolphins only) interactions with BRDs were very rare (n = 7) despite high levels of attendance and depredation during trawling. Loss of targeted teleosts through the BRD hatch was rare (1.3% of day trawls). This relatively cost-effective method of electronic monitoring achieved very high levels of subsurface observer coverage (60% of day trawls or 56% of day trawl hours), and provided evidence that the subsurface expulsion of megafauna in poor condition is negligible. Furthermore, this study provides species-specific improvements toward bycatch mitigation strategies for demersal fish trawling.

AB  - Assumptions about gear efficiency and catchability influence estimates of abundance, mortality, reference points and catch potential. Despite the need to better quantify fishing effects on some target species and on many non-target species taken as bycatch, there are few gear efficiency estimates for some of the most widely deployed towed fishing gears in the northeast Atlantic. Here, we develop a method that applies generalised additive models to catch-at-length data from trawl surveys and a commercial catch and discard monitoring program in the North Sea to estimate catch-ratios. We then rescale these catch-ratios and fit relationships to estimate gear efficiency. When catches of individuals by species were too low to enable species-specific estimates, gear efficiency was estimated for species-groups. Gear efficiency (and associated uncertainty) at length was ultimately estimated for 75 species, seven species-groups and for up to six types of trawl gear per species or species-group. Results are illustrated for dab (Limanda limanda), grey gurnard (Eutrigula gurnardus) and thornback ray (Raja clavata), two common non-target species and a depleted elasmobranch. All estimates of gear efficiency and uncertainty, by length, species, species-group and gear, are made available in a supplementary data file.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is considered the most serious threat globally to long‐lived marine megafauna (e.g., mammals, birds, turtles, elasmobranchs). However, bycatch assessments to date have not evaluated population‐level bycatch impacts across fishing gears. Here, we provide the first global, multi‐gear evaluation of population‐level fisheries bycatch impacts for marine turtles. To compare bycatch impacts of multiple gears within and among marine turtle populations (or regional management units, RMUs), we compiled more than 1,800 records from over 230 sources of reported marine turtle bycatch in longline, net, and trawl fisheries worldwide that were published between 1990–2011. The highest bycatch rates and levels of observed effort for each gear category occurred in the East Pacific, Northwest and Southwest Atlantic, and Mediterranean regions, which were also the regions of highest data availability. Overall, available data were dominated by longline records (nearly 60% of all records), and were non‐uniformly distributed, with significant data gaps around Africa, in the Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia. We found that bycatch impact scores—which integrate information on bycatch rates, fishing effort, mortality rates, and body sizes (i.e., proxies for reproductive values) of turtles taken as bycatch—as well as mortality rates in particular, were significantly lower in longline fishing gear than in net and trawl fishing gears. Based on bycatch impact scores and RMU‐specific population metrics, we identified the RMUs most and least threatened by bycatch globally, and found wide variation among species, regions, and gears within these classifications. The lack of regional or species‐specific patterns in bycatch impacts across fishing gears suggests that gear types and RMUs in which bycatch has the highest impact depend on spatially‐explicit overlaps of fisheries (e.g., gear characteristics, fishing practices, target species), marine turtle populations (e.g., conservation status, aggregation areas), and underlying habitat features (e.g., oceanographic conditions). Our study provides a blueprint both for prioritizing limited conservation resources toward managing fishing gears and practices with the highest population impacts on sea turtles and for enhancing data collection and reporting efforts.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is a primary driver of population declines in several species of marine megafauna (e.g., elasmobranchs, mammals, seabirds, turtles). Characterizing the global bycatch seascape using data on bycatch rates across fisheries is essential for highlighting conservation priorities. We compiled a comprehensive database of reported data on marine turtle bycatch in gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries worldwide from 1990 to 2008. The total reported global marine turtle bycatch was ∼85,000 turtles, but due to the small percentage of fishing effort observed and reported (typically <1% of total fleets), and to a global lack of bycatch information from small‐scale fisheries, this likely underestimates the true total by at least two orders of magnitude. Our synthesis also highlights an apparently universal pattern across fishing gears and regions where high bycatch rates were associated with low observed effort, which emphasizes the need for strategic bycatch data collection and reporting. This study provides the first global perspective of fisheries bycatch for marine turtles and highlights region–gear combinations that warrant urgent conservation action (e.g., gillnets, longlines, and trawls in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean) and region–gear combinations in need of enhanced observation and reporting efforts (e.g., eastern Indian Ocean gillnets, West African trawls).

AB  - Shark catches are common in small‐scale (artisanal) and recreational fisheries; the magnitudes of these catches remain poorly known and understudied, particularly in developing countries. Data from three sources were used to assess the composition of shark landings in these fisheries in Kenya: boat‐based recreational fishery tagging 1987–2016; observed landings from the Bycatch Assessment and Mitigation in the Western Indian Ocean Fisheries Project 2016–2017; and Catch Assessment Surveys landings data 2017–2020. Eighteen species were identified among 1,215 sharks recorded in small‐scale fisheries between June 2016 and June 2017. Most of them belonged to the families Carcharhinidae (26%), Triakidae (23%) and Sphyrnidae (14%). Longlines (41%), drift gillnets (30%) and bottom‐set gillnets (21%) recorded the highest proportions of catches. A total of 501 sharks comprising 16 species were recorded in the recreational tagging data between 1987 and 2016, caught using either trolling lines or rods and reels. The families Carcharhinidae (56%) and Sphyrnidae (12%) represented the highest proportion of the catch. A generalized linear model was used to assess the effect of year, gear type, season and vessel propulsion mode on the variation in catches of sharks in small‐scale fisheries between 2017 and 2020. Catches were significantly higher in 2017 with high catch rates observed in longlines and handlines. Findings from this study highlight the importance of citizen science by recreational fishers in increasing awareness around the risks and threats to shark populations. Strengthening of existing monitoring of shark interactions with small‐scale and recreational fisheries is important alongside the implementation of appropriate conservation and management measures such as reductions in fishing effort (e.g. prawn trawling) in nursery areas, prohibiting the capture of CITES‐protected species, and enforcing catch‐and‐release practices by sport fishers to ensure the long‐term sustainability of both the affected shark species and the livelihoods of the fishers.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch of marine animals has been linked to population declines of multiple species, including many sea turtles. Altering the visual cues associated with fishing gear may reduce sea turtle bycatch. We examined the effectiveness of illuminating gillnets with ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diodes for reducing green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) interactions. We found that the mean sea turtle capture rate was reduced by 39.7% in UV-illuminated nets compared with nets without illumination. In collaboration with commercial fishermen, we tested UV net illumination in a bottom-set gillnet fishery in Baja California, Mexico. We did not find any difference in overall target fish catch rate or market value between net types. These findings suggest that UV net illumination may have applications in coastal and pelagic gillnet fisheries to reduce sea turtle bycatch.

AB  - A substantial level of non-target species are often caught in tuna longline fisheries, which can therefore impose a heavy ecological burden on pelagic fish communities. However, limited studies have quantitatively examined the scale of bycatch varying across fishing fleets and areas in regional tuna longline fisheries, as data are often sparse. We used scientific observer data to analyze the discard and bycatch patterns of Chinese tuna longline fleets in the Pacific Ocean by applying general statistical analysis and spatial hotspots analysis. A total of 9971 sets were observed, representing 1.56% of the total efforts. Of 435,156 individuals, 30.4% were recorded as bycatch, and 15.8% were discarded. The majority of bycatch was other bony fishes (15.5%) and sharks (7.3%). Bycatch and discard rates of the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus, BET) fleet were larger than that of the albacore (Thunnus alalunga, ALB) fleet. The highest bycatch rates of other bony fishes and elasmobranchs most often occurred in the western and central temperate Pacific and the eastern tropical Pacific, respectively. Most marine turtles and mammals were caught by the BET fleet in the Tropical Pacific, and the bycatch of seabirds often occurred in the Temperate Pacific. Low bycatch rates but high discard mortality of marine mammals, turtles, and sea birds were found. Bycatch rates were estimated by fleet, seasons, and areas, with the rates of marine turtles ranging from 0 to 0.024 per 1000 hooks, and those of sea birds ranging from 0 to 0.228 per 1000 hooks. Six bycatch hotspots, identified in this study, should be considered in future management and conservation planning. Implementing measures such as live releasing bycatch, reducing the fishing efforts in the area with high bycatch rate, optimizing monitoring programs, and allocating observers more widely in areas where there is more bycatch are necessary.

AB  - The biodiversity of the bycatch community in tuna longline fisheries has historically been under-studied. In this study, observer data from 9744 sets of Chinese tuna longline fisheries were used to estimate the biodiversity of the bycatch by applying alpha diversity measures, and their habitat preference was predicted with the Generalized Additive Model. A total of 98 bycatch species were observed, mainly consisting of bony fishes and elasmobranchs. We found that there was a similar species composition in the ALB (Thunnus alalunga) and BET (Thunnus obesus) sets that was different in abundance assemblages. Regarding the entire study area, biodiversity in the tropical Pacific was higher than that in the temperate Pacific, and it was highest in the eastern tropical Pacific. In the western Pacific, higher pelagic biodiversity was noted between 15° and 20° latitude. The species richness and diversity were largely influenced by geographical positions, sea surface temperature and fishing depth. The indicators of species richness and density performed well in identifying the hotspots of biodiversity. This study helps to understand the predator biodiversity in pelagic ecosystems and identify, for conservation purposes, critical habitats for the bycatch community in tuna longline fisheries.

AB  - Purse seiners deploy large amounts of drifting fish aggregation devices (FADs) in all tropical oceans to catch tunas. These FADs are constructed with porous synthetic fibre netting, which are responsible for incidental mortality of sea turtles and sharks through entanglement, and can engage in ghost fishing if they are lost and abandoned. The use of natural or biodegradable materials to build FADs can effectively mitigate marine pollution and bycatch issues, and as such they are currently promoted by fisheries management organizations. This study evaluated the degradability of ropes made of common natural fibres; cotton rope (3-strand, 96-thread, twisted, S-lay), jute rope (3-strand, 13-thread, twisted, Z-lay) and sisal rope (3-strand, 8-thread, twisted, Z-lay). Degradability was evaluated by measuring the breaking strength (cN/dtex) and retention ratio of rupture elongation. Results showed that jute rope and sisal rope experienced rapid reduction of strength which over the first month soaking in the sea fell by 66.8% and 46.9%, respectively. Cotton rope exhibited the most inert degradation behavior, with breaking strength maintained at half of the initial value at 10 months. The retention ratio of rupture elongation for jute ropes and sisal ropes fluctuated considerably in the following months after deployment, compared to the relatively stable change for cotton rope. Results suggested that among these congeners, cotton rope would be most preferable component for Bio-FADs with a 10-month minimum durability that matches the required lifetime of FAD fishing strategies.

AB  - We assess the performance of circle hooks, which are promoted as a measure for improving the survival of marine turtles following interactions with pelagic longlines. We conducted experiments off eastern Australia on commercial fishing vessels that alternated circle hooks (mostly size 14/0) and Japanese tuna hooks along their longlines. Most animals were hooked in the lip or jaw, regardless of hook type. There was no difference in the mean size of animals caught on the two types of hook, except for striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax), which tended to be larger on tuna hooks. Most species had an equal or lower probability of being alive on circle hooks than tuna hooks. Catch rates on circle hooks exceeded those on tuna hooks for most species. These included several target species, such as albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and striped marlin, and bycatch, including several shark species. The differences in catch rates were large enough to increase total catches and financial returns. The financial benefits of increased catches outweighed the costs of converting to circle hooks. The results indicate that the adoption of small circle hooks by longliners will not be detrimental to financial returns.

AB  - We assess the performance of wire leaders, which some jurisdictions have banned to reduce shark mortality from pelagic longline fishing. Experiments were conducted off northeastern Australia on commercial vessels that deployed equal numbers of wire and nylon monofilament leaders randomly along their longlines. Catch rates of several species, including sharks, were lower on nylon than on wire leaders, probably because those animals often escape by biting through the nylon leaders. High bite-off rates indicate that as many animals escape from nylon leaders as are caught on nylon leaders. The fate of escaped animals is not known, although large sharks are more likely to survive than are small animals. By contrast, catch rates of valuable bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) were higher on nylon than on wire leaders. Bigeye tuna are probably able to see wire leaders and avoid those hooks. The financial benefits of increased bigeye tuna catches outweigh the costs associated with banning wire leaders, such as increased rates of gear loss. Thus, banning wire leaders is an effective way of reducing shark catches that fishers should be keen to adopt.

AB  - The interspecific preferences of fishes for different depths and habitats suggest fishers could avoid unwanted catches of some species while still effectively targeting other species. In pelagic longline fisheries, albacore (Thunnus alalunga) are often caught in relatively cooler, deeper water (>100 m) than many species of conservation concern (e.g., sea turtles, billfishes, and some sharks) that are caught in shallower water (<100 m). From 2007 to 2011, we examined the depth distributions of hooks for 1154 longline sets (3,406,946 hooks) and recorded captures by hook position on 2642 sets (7,829,498 hooks) in the American Samoa longline fishery. Twenty-three percent of hooks had a settled depth <100 m. Individuals captured in the 3 shallowest hook positions accounted for 18.3% of all bycatch. We analyzed hypothetical impacts for 25 of the most abundant species caught in the fishery by eliminating the 3 shallowest hook positions under scenarios with and without redistribution of these hooks to deeper depths. Distributions varied by species: 45.5% (n = 10) of green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), 59.5% (n = 626) of shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), 37.3% (n = 435) of silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), and 42.6% (n = 150) of oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus) were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Eleven percent (n = 20,435) of all tuna and 8.5% (n = 10,374) of albacore were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Hook elimination reduced landed value by 1.6-9.2%, and redistribution of hooks increased average annual landed value relative to the status quo by 5-11.7%. Based on these scenarios, redistribution of hooks to deeper depths may provide an economically feasible modification to longline gear that could substantially reduce bycatch for a suite of vulnerable species. Our results suggest that this method may be applicable to deep-set pelagic longline fisheries worldwide.

AB  - Bycatch--the incidental catch of nontarget species--is a principal concern in marine conservation and fisheries management. In the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna fishery, a large fraction of nonmammal bycatch is captured by purse-seine gear when nets are deployed around floating objects. We examined the spatial distribution of a dominant species in this fishery's bycatch, the apex predator silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from 1994 to 2005 to determine whether spatial closures, areas where fishing is prohibited, might effectively reduce the bycatch of this species. We then identified candidate locations for fishery closures that specifically considered the trade-off between bycatch reduction and the loss of tuna catch and evaluated ancillary conservation benefits to less commonly captured taxa. Smoothed spatial distributions of silky shark bycatch did not indicate persistent small areas of especially high bycatch for any size class of shark over the 12-year period. Nevertheless, bycatch of small silky sharks (<90 cm total length) was consistently higher north of the equator during all years. On the basis of this distribution, we evaluated nearly 100 candidate closure areas between 5°N and 15°N that could have reduced, by as much as 33%, the total silky shark bycatch while compromising only 12% of the tuna catch. Although silky sharks are the predominant species of elasmobranchs caught as bycatch in this fishery, closures also suggested reductions in the bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, including other shark species and turtles. Our technique provides an effective method with which to balance the costs and benefits of conservation in fisheries management. Spatial closures are a viable management tool, but implementation should be preceded by careful consideration of the consequences of fishing reallocation.

AB  - The understanding of trophic relationships is vital for correctly modeling ecosystems and ecosystem effects of fisheries removals. The pelagic stingray is found in epipelagic sub‐tropical and tropical waters worldwide and is a common bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. Between August 2008 and November 2011, 156 specimens (81 males; 75 females) were collected during pelagic longline fishing operations in the US South Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Mexico. Stomach content analyses found that the major prey items were cephalopod molluscs (59.18%), followed by actinopterygiian fishes (37.75%), and decapod crustaceans (35.71%). These concentrations of prey items found in the stomachs coincide with previous studies done in the Pacific Ocean. In contrast to previous studies that found high percentages of empty stomachs (63%), the current percentage of empty stomachs was much lower (25.6%), likely due to shorter times between collection and inspection. Stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) was performed on white muscle in order to correlate the trophic position with gut‐content analysis. The δ13C values ranged from ‐18.81‰ to ‐16.70‰, while the δ15N ranged from 6.11‰ to 11.88‰. Modeling of stable isotope data suggest that while squid are occasionally an important part of the pelagic stingray diet, prey usually consist of shrimp and other pelagic crustaceans. Pelagic stingrays fed within two trophic levels, but their prey appeared to feed on different carbon sources than those found in other pelagic elasmobranchs. A deeper understanding of the pelagic stingray diet sources can help fisheries management as it begins to transition into ecosystem‐based management.

AB  - The elasmobranch bycatch of the Gulf of Papua Prawn Fishery is investigated in detail for the first time. Fisheries observers collected data on the elasmobranch bycatch from a total of 403 trawl sets (1,273 hrs) in the Gulf of Papua. A total of 40 species of elasmobranchs were recorded ranging in size from a 12 cm disc width stingray to a 350 cm total length sawfish. High mortality rates were recorded (>80%), attributed to the long trawl durations (up to 4 hours). The future inclusion of bycatch reduction devices would likely reduce the number of larger elasmobranchs being caught, based on evidence from the prawn trawl fisheries of northern Australia, and is being investigated by the PNG National Fisheries Authority. Differences in catch compositions were detected across the management zones as well as between the two monsoonal seasons (SE Monsoon and NW Monsoon). Increased monitoring and additional research is required and management plans should address the elasmobranch bycatch and in particular their high mortality rate.

AB  - This paper provides some of the only fisheries and quantitative biological data for the Mobulidae (manta and devil rays), a group of large pelagic species that are widely distributed in tropical and warm temperate waters. The data were derived from 409 mobulids that were taken as bycatch of drift gillnet fisheries for the skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis and subsequently examined at fish landing sites in Indonesia. The most abundant of the five species was Mobula japanica (∼50%), followed by Mobula tarapacana (∼24%), Manta birostris (∼14%), Mobula thurstoni (9%) and Mobula cf kuhlii (2%). The four most abundant species were represented by a wide size range of each species and, in the case of Mobula japanica, by embryos, neonates and fully mature individuals. The disc width at maturity (DW50) of males, derived from the proportion of males at each size class with fully calcified claspers, ranged from 1538mm for Mobula thurstoni to 3752mm for M. birostris. As the claspers of males become calcified over a relatively narrow size range, the process of maturation is presumably relatively rapid. There is an increasing demand for various body parts of mobulids. Branchial filter plates, which are used for traditional Chinese medicines, are the most valuable, fetching as much as 30 $US a kilo (dry weight). The skins are dried and deep fried and the flesh salted and dried and these are used for human consumption, while cartilage is dried for export as a filler for shark-fin soup. The very low fecundity of the large and probably long-lived mobulid rays make the stocks of their species particularly susceptible to further increases in fishing.

AB  - The eagle ray Aetobatus flagellum (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) is redescribed based on new material from the Persian Gulf (Kuwait), Indonesia and Malaysia. A related but distinct species of Aetobatus from the western North Pacific, previously referred to as A. flagellum, is reported. Aetobatus flagellum is a medium-sized eagle ray which attains about 900 mm DW; males mature at approximately 500 mm DW. Aetobatus flagellum appears to be uncommon and restricted to estuary-influenced waters of the Indo-West Pacific. It is caught as gillnet bycatch where its habit of schooling, combined with probable small litter size, may make it particularly vulnerable to impacts from fisheries.

AB  - Bycatch mortality is a major factor contributing to shark population declines. Post-release mortality (PRM) is particularly difficult to quantify, limiting the accuracy of stock assessments. We paired blood-stress physiology with animal-borne accelerometers to quantify PRM rates of sharks caught in a commercial bottom longline fishery. Blood was sampled from the same individuals that were tagged, providing direct correlation between stress physiology and animal fate for sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus, N = 130), blacktip (C. limbatus, N = 105), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier, N = 52), spinner (C. brevipinna, N = 14), and bull sharks (C. leucas, N = 14). PRM rates ranged from 2% and 3% PRM in tiger and sandbar sharks to 42% and 71% PRM in blacktip and spinner sharks, respectively. Decision trees based on blood values predicted mortality with >67% accuracy in blacktip and spinner sharks, and >99% accuracy in sandbar sharks. Ninety percent of PRM occurred within 5 h after release and 59% within 2 h. Blood physiology indicated that PRM was primarily associated with acidosis and increases in plasma potassium levels. Total fishing mortality reached 62% for blacktip and 89% for spinner sharks, which may be under-estimates given that some soak times were shortened to focus on PRM. Our findings suggest that no-take regulations may be beneficial for sandbar, tiger, and bull sharks, but less effective for more susceptible species such as blacktip and spinner sharks.

AB  - Mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) is a resilient pelagic species that could provide long-term highly productive fisheries. Using FAO data we document enormous increases (746%) in reported global mahi-mahi landings since 1950. Detailed mahi-mahi fisheries records are limited, but an observer program monitoring Costa Rica’s Pacific mahi-mahi pelagic longline fleet between 1999 and 2008 (n=217 sets) provided a rare opportunity to quantify bycatch in these fisheries. Several sea turtles and sharks of global conservation concern were caught incidentally: olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea; n=1348, mean=9.05 per 1000 hooks), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis; n=402, mean=2.96 per 1000 hooks), thresher sharks (Alopias sp.; n=158, mean=1.12 per 1000 hooks), green turtle (Chelonia mydas; n=49, mean=0.35 per 1000 hooks), and three other threatened sharks in small numbers. Pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea; a ray of low conservation concern) was also a common bycatch (n=625, mean=4.77 per 1000 hooks). Generalized linear models (GLMs) of catch rates showed increases in olive ridley turtles and decreases in mahi-mahi and silky sharks over the decade examined. The high hooking survival rates of olive ridley and green turtles in observed sets (95% and 96% respectively) suggest that widespread training of the fleet in careful gear removal and turtle release methods could be one effective bycatch mitigation strategy for these species. GLMs also provide evidence that closing the fishery during peak olive ridley nesting times (at least near nesting beaches), in combination with reduced gear soak times, could help minimize the fishery’s impacts on threatened bycatch species while still maintaining a productive fishery.

AB  - Masalah umum yang dihadapi dalam operasi penangkapan ikan terhadap sumberdaya yang sifatnya multi spesies dan multi-cohort di daerah tropis adalah diperolehnya hasil tangkapan bukan spesies target yang biasa disebut hasil tangkap samping (HTS) atau by-catch. Saat ini informasi mengenai HTS pada perikanan rawai tuna di Indonesia yang beroperasi di Samudera Pasifik masih terbatas. Disisi lain informasi tersebut sangat dibutuhkan dalam rangka pelaksanaan pengelelolaan sumberdaya tuna yang memadai. Penelitian yang bertujuan untuk mendapatkan infomasi tentang HTS pada perikanan rawai tuna di Samudera Pasifik dilakukan di Bitung bulan Mei sampai Juli 2010. Penelitian dilakukan dengan dua cara yaitu melalui pengambilan contoh di pusat pendaratan armada rawai tuna (port sampling) dan observer di kapal rawai tuna (onboard observer). Port sampling dilakukan setiap hari pada minngu keempat selama bulan Mei sampai Oktober 2010. Onboard observer dilakukan sebanyak dua trip operasi penangkapan rawai tuna. Data yang dikumpulkan meliputi aspek operasional rawai tuna, jeni ikan HTS dan ukuran panjang cagak ikan HTS. Hasil riset menunjukkan bahwa rata-rata laju pancing HTS selama Mei sampai Oktober 2010 adalah 19,6 kg/100 mata pancing per tawur. Sebanyak 16 spesies HTS rawai tuna dapat diidentifikasi yang didominasi oleh ikan setuhuk hitam atau black marlin (Makaira indica). Ukuran low jaw fork length (LJFL) ikan ikan setuhuk hitam dan ikan meka secara berturut-turut adalah 97-198 cm (modus 141-160 cm), 94-241 cm (modus 161-180 cm) dan ukuran fork length ikan tikusan adalah 96-190 cm (modus 121-140 cm).   The common fishing operation problematic in tropical waters which characterized by multispecies and multi-cohort resource is the numbers of bycatch exploited. Currently, the information of bycatch in the longline fishery especially operated in the Pacific Ocean is limited. On the other hand, this information is necessary for the implementation tuna fisheries management framework. The objective of this research is to collate the information of Pacific tuna longline bycatch landed in Bitung during the period of May until July 2010. Research conducted in two ways i.e. through port sampling at the central landing of tuna longline and observer onboard. Port sampling was conducted in the forth week during May until October 2010, whilst observer onboard was conducted in two trips within that period. Data collected consists of operational aspects of tuna longliners, species composition of bycatch and its fork length. Results of this research showed that the average of hook rate during the period of May October 2010 was 19.10 kg/100 hooks per set. Sixteen species of tuna longline bycatch have been identified and showed that black marlin (Makaira indica) was predominant. Size of Low Jaw Fork Length (LJFL) of blackmarlin, swordfish and thresher shark were 97-198 cm (mode 141-160 cm), 94-241 cm (mode 161-180 cm) and 96- 190 cm (121-140 cm) respectively.

AB  - Chilean Patagonia (41 ∘ 00’–57 ∘ 00’S) is among the least researched ocean regions in the world but supports commercial fisheries for several fish species, including the pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes). Fishery monitoring of this species in fjords is fragmented, thus limiting the quality and quantity of useful information for stock assessment purposes. We proposed a methodological approach to constructing an abundance index for pink cusk-eel, based on catch per unit of effort surveys in the fjords and inner channels of Patagonia in three administrative regions in Chile (Los Lagos, Aysén, and Magallanes). Information regarding the definition of areas to be sampled and the related operational characteristics were gathered by interviewing fishers. Two research surveys were conducted on board artisanal longline vessels in each administrative region during autumn and spring of 2018. Within each region, 12 fishing grounds were sampled using a standardised protocol for soaking times, number of hooks per line and type of bait, and information was also recorded on target and bycatch species. In the Los Lagos region, the mean catch rate of pink cusk-eel was 3.5 and 4.1 fish/100 hooks on the first and second surveys, respectively. For the Aysén region, the mean catch rate of pink cusk-eel was 1.9 fish/100 hooks in the first survey and 6.6 fish/100 hooks in the second survey. The catch rates of pink cusk-eel on the Magallanes region were low, with only 0.5 fish/100 hooks in the first survey and 0.7 fish/100 hooks in the second survey The main teleost species in the bycatch were tadpole codling (Salilota australis) and rockfish (Helicolenus lengerichi), while the elasmobranch species were dogfish (Schroederichthys chilensis) and yellownose skate (Zearaja chilensis). The mean lengths of pink cusk-eel and tadpole codling showed a latitudinal gradient. This manuscript proposes recommendations and gives insights regarding the design and implementation of surveys over extensive and remote areas with unfavourable weather conditions and where fishery monitoring is fragmented.

AB  - Worldwide, many species of elasmobranchs (Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are currently threatened by marine fisheries activity and are on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Although Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) for teleost fish and Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) are now widespread in tropical shrimp trawling, information on their ability to mitigate bycatch of elasmobranchs, particularly rays (Batoidea), is scarce and limited to only a few isolated fisheries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of trawls fitted with a square-mesh panel BRD and super-shooter TED in reducing ray bycatch. In this study, 65 catch-comparison hauls were conducted in the Atlantic seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) fishery off Suriname. Trawls with a BRD and TED combination reduced ray catch rate by 36%. A 21% reduction in mean size indicated the preferential exclusion of large rays. Hence, high escape ratios were observed for Dasyatis geijskesi (77%), a large-sized species, while exclusion of the small species Urotrygon microphthalmum was not significant, although their disc width is small enough to pass through the meshes of the BRD. Furthermore, a size-dependent escape for the two most abundant mid-sized ray species Dasyatis guttata and Gymnura micrura was observed. Exclusion-at-size differed for both species, however, likely related to species-specific morphology or behavior in response to the TED. This study shows that the combination of BRD and TED causes an important reduction in ray bycatch in seabob shrimp fisheries off Suriname. The great reduction in catch of large-sized rays is positive, but the mortality of juvenile rays is likely to have negative consequences for their populations. We therefore recommend gear-based and non-gear adaptations to further reduce the bycatch of small-sized rays.

AB  - Data were combined from surveys in 2013, 2018, 2019 and 2021 to examine biomass changes of the skate (Rajiformes) stock in waters around the Falkland Islands. The 2013 and 2019 surveys were research surveys for skate abundance and used 90 mm trawl mesh to capture species and size compositions. The 2018 survey was a mesh size trial, and the 2021 survey was a commercial exploration; both used 400 mm trawl mesh to target skates. All four surveys were compared for biomass by deselecting the proportions of skates per size interval caught in 90 mm mesh that would not have been caught in 400 mm mesh, calculated with the SELECT method. Estimated commercial-size skate biomass decreased for most species individually and approximately 61% overall. Estimated commercial-size skate biomass also decreased by as much south of 51° latitude, the area that was closed to skate target fishing since 1996, as north of 51° latitude, which has been maintained open to skate target fishing. The outcome is correlated with continuing skate bycatch in finfish trawls.

AB  - The fate of bycatch species released back into the water is crucial to estimate population status and consequent decisions to implement adequate management measurements for elasmobranchs. The shortnose guitarfish, Zapteryx brevirostris, is an endemic species of the Southwest Atlantic. It is currently listed as ‘Vulnerable’ both in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Brazilian red lists. Although this species displays high tolerance to capture and transportation by fishers from the capture site to the fish market, a significant reduction in survival rates is observed during the reproductive period. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine post‐capture and post‐commercial transportation consequences in pregnant females obtained as bycatch from artisanal fisheries in Southern Brazil. Results showed high abortion rates and reduced maternal survival after abortion, with all abortions occurring within 28 h of monitoring in laboratory. Stress plasma markers were also evaluated, to determine the physiological consequences of capture‐induced parturition to pregnant females. Results showed alteration in all markers measured (plasma urea, pH, lactate, phosphorus, and potassium) with values for dead pregnant females being different from non‐pregnant females and those which survived capture and subsequent abortions. The mortality caused by fisheries bycatch may prove difficult to manage, with immediate release and specific handling protocols for pregnant females implemented through environmental education environmental education and fishermen training programs, potential options to maintain adequate maternal survival and recruitment for this species. There is a growing concern about elamobranch overfishing worldwide, as well as an urgent need for the implementation of containment plans for bycatch, representing a very significant volume of annual catches for batoids and sharks. This study provides new information to understand the impact caused by incidental capture in an endemic and threatened guitarfish, suggesting practices to assist with satisfactory management plans for the shortnose guitarfish, Zapteryx brevirostris, especially during their reproductive season.

AB  - The current Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus (Daggernose Shark) population status Q7points to 99% losses in the last decade due to certain biological traits, site fidelity, and historical high representativeness as bycatch in artisanal fisheries. This species is listed as Critically Endangered (CR), both in the IUCN and the Brazilian Red Lists. Its vulnerability is so high that its recovery potential requires protection from ongoing fishing pressure. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the health status of Daggernose sharks and their ability to cope with allostatic overload in a comparative analysis with other Carcharhinid and Sphyrnid sharks. Sharks incidentally caught by the artisanal fleet in the state of Maranhão, on the Brazilian Amazon Coast, were sampled for blood, and serum was used to assess biochemical markers. The findings indicate significant differences in Daggernose Shark homeostatic capacity for ALP, ALT/GTP, creatinine, lactate, urea, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, pointing to lower health scores and recovery capacity when compared to other Carcharhiniformes inhabiting the same region. It is possible that such vulnerability is a result of fisheries-induced evolution, leading to remaining populations with very low chances of fully recovering. Conservation planning is thus urgent, as current legislation based on fishing bans does very little for the species. International collaboration and longterm recovery measures are necessary, including the creation of MPAs specially designed for the species and captive maintenance aiming to monitor health status and carry out breeding attempts.

AB  - The shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, is one of the most common bycatch species of the Taiwanese tuna longline fishery (Taiwan was second-largest shortfin mako shark-catching nation) in the Indian Ocean. The present study estimated the distribution and relative abundance indices of the shortfin mako in the Indian Ocean using observer records and logbook data from the period 2005–2018. To deal with the high number of zero catch records ( ∼ 90%), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) was standardized using a Zero inflated negative binomial model (ZINB). Cluster analysis was used to identify the fishing operations associated with different fishing strategies and then incorporated as a factor related to target species into the ZINB. Considerable variation was observed in the size distribution by region and season in the Indian ocean. Larger mako sharks (age>15 and age>7 yr for female and male, respectively) tend to occur in equatorial and tropical regions, while smaller specimens appear at higher latitudes in temperate waters. Cluster analysis produced five fishing clusters based on the catch compositions of the main species. The target factor (cluster) was important in explaining the variance in ZINB models. Overall, the standardized CPUEs and nominal CPUEs analysis for the shortfin mako caught by the Taiwanese longline fishery indicates a stable and increasing trend in recent years.

AB  - Sharks occupy an important ecological niche in marine ecosystems. As top predators, they can restrict and control the behavior, numbers and composition of other species through downward effects, and play an essential role in ecosystem stability. Shark fishery data are limited, and for most Chondrichthyes species there is no formal fishery resource assessment at a global level. In this study, we applied the length-based Bayesian biomass (LBB) estimation method to assess the stock status of four common shark bycatch species of which more than 100 samples were collected in coastal waters of the northern South China Sea. Estimates of the length of 50% of individuals captured by gear/the length at first capture that maximized the catch and biomass (Lc/Lc_opt) of a species ranged from 0.49 to 1.4; the draughtsboard shark Cephaloscyllium sarawakensis had the highest value, and the shortnose dogfish Squalus brevirostris had the lowest. Estimates of the collected biomass/biomass of the maximum sustainable yield (B/BMSY) ranged from 0.86 to 1.9. Both C. sarawakensis and the spadenose shark Scoliodon laticaudus were fully exploited, while the spatulasnout catshark Apristurus platyrhynchus and S. brevirostris were in good condition. To verify the stability of the LBB, length frequency data for the most common species S. laticaudus were divided into different size-class intervals; simulations revealed estimated parameters based on these to be insensitive to differences in intervals, except for the smallest (10 mm), which did not affect evaluation results. These results can be used to provide a scientific basis on which shark fisheries in this region can be managed and prior parameters for related resource assessment methods can be determined.

AB  - The effects of bait species (mackerel and squid) and color (blue-dyed and non-dyed) on the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta bycatch in a pelagic longline fishery in the western North Pacific were assessed in shallow-set longline fishing experiments. The loggerhead turtle catches were analyzed using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution. The potential factors (bait species, bait color, other species catch, and sea surface temperature) affecting loggerhead turtle catch were incorporated as explanatory variables. The model analyses indicated that bait species affected loggerhead turtle catch, while bait color did not. The model predicted that catch rates of loggerhead turtles were 75% less on mackerel bait to squid bait. This study demonstrated that fish bait choice was very effective in reducing loggerhead turtle bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, but that the use of blue-dyed bait was not. Similar model analyses were also performed on target and by-product fish species, such as swordfish Xiphias gladius, striped marlin Tetrapturus audax, bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, blue shark Prionace glauca, and shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus, and other non-target species. The remarkable differences between bait species and color that were found for loggerhead turtles were not found for these species catches.

AB  - Elasmobranchs make a large contribution to bycatch in commercial trawl fisheries, which reduces the efficiency (and thus profitability of those fisheries), results in injury and mortality of those elasmobranchs, and can lead to unsustainable rates of catches. The development of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) for elasmobranchs has been hindered, among other things, by a lack of knowledge of their avoidance behaviours and thus their vulnerability to capture (catchability). This lack of knowledge potentially affects assessments of the impact of fishing on those bycatch species. Here we examined underwater behaviours, using video analysis, of three species of elasmobranchs (two stingarees, i.e. Urolophus cruciatus and U. paucimaculatus, and one draughtboard shark, Cephalocyllium laticeps) in response to an approaching demersal trawl to quantify behavioural factors that affect their catchability. The morphologically similar U.cruciatus and U. paucimaculatus were similarly abundant, i.e. 290 and 218 individuals, respectively, but displayed different net avoidance behaviours, with U. paucimaculatus being far more likely to enter the trawl. The greater catchability of U. paucimaculatus would falsely suggest this less common species was more abundant than U. cruciatus, which has implications for any assessments of the impacts of trawling on these two elasmobranchs. Collision with trawl gear was relatively common for both Urolophus spp., and this was shown to decrease their likelihood of capture. In contrast, only 1 of the 68 individuals of the morphologically-different C. laticeps collided with gear. These results will help inform future development of BRDs and highlight that understanding the behaviour of elasmobranchs in response to capture methods should form an integral component of assessments of the impacts of trawling on this highly affected group.

Bycatch in longline fishery is recorded to be one of the major factors defining the declined populations of endangered marine species worldwide. This research aimed to identify bycatch level of sharks, marine mammals and seabirds as well as to pinpoint the mitigation options in Indonesian tuna longline fishery. In this study, a total of 8,564,858 hooks were observed from 5,622 gear settings in Indonesian tuna longline fishery based in two major fishing ports, namely Bitung Fishing Port-North Sulawesi and Benoa Port-Bali from May 2006 to June 2014. The results suggest that the best hook rate per thousand hooks in Indonesian tuna longline fisheries for shark bycatch was 0.2446, followed by 0.0030 for seabird bycatch, 0.0021 for dolphin bycatch and 0.0009 for whale bycatch. Seabirds largely acquired in the dead condition while the other species were found still alive (sharks and marine mammals). Bycatch of seabirds only occured in the vessels based in Benoa Bali, and the correlation value (R2) of sharks and seabirds caught at night time was low while for marine mammals was very strong. Deep setting system of fishing gears and night setting also proved to be more effective to reduce bycatch of those critical marine species.

AB  - Incidental catch of S. lewini by artisanal fishermen in Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica, suggest that this could be one of the coastal locations used by the species. This study aims to characterize the scalloped hammerhead shark population in Golfo Dulce, in order to best guide management actions for the conservation and sustainable use of the species. Fisheries-dependent biological data (size-TL, sex, reproductive status) were gathered for S. lewini between May 2010 and May 2011 in the communities of Puerto Jimenez and Pavones, Golfo Dulce during artisanal fishing trips. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) throughout the year was also estimated from catch data. We sampled a total of 315 sharks. Mean total length was estimated at 74.3±17.4cm. Both pups and juveniles were reported, which presented a male: female ratio of 1:1.2 (p>0.05). Total length and relative abundance of S. lewini had opposite tendencies, with the smallest TL (64cm) recorded during July-August, when CPUE was highest. (0.0075). Temporary closures from June to August are therefore recommended at areas of highest reported catch (Pique Fijo, Los Bajos y La Ciénaga), in order to protect newly born S. lewini, and promote the sustainability of the species in the ETPS Closures should be complemented with a long-term study that can further clarify whether Golfo Dulce is a nursery area for S. lewini.

AB  - The accidental capture of large animals such as sharks, manta rays, sea turtles, and dolphins in pelagic trawler fisheries remains controversial because it threatens biological diversity in many biogeographical regions, including the subtropical eastern North Atlantic. Bycatch rates observed during more than 1400 trawl sets off Mauritania, Northwest Africa, are shown to have been considerable during the past 4 years, with high animal abundance in Summer when the Northwest African shelf is occupied by subtropical water. We demonstrate the urgency for bycatch reduction and evaluate the use of species-selective gear, a conservation method immediately available and immediately effective in waters fished through international access agreements. A modification tested in commercial trawls during the observer program guides pelagic megafauna deflected by a filter to an escape tunnel along the bottom of the trawl. This “excluder” reduces bycatch mortality of the most vulnerable megafauna species by at least 40–100%.

AB  - We present a quantitative approach to the ecological Sustainability Assessment for Fishing Effects (SAFE) on diverse and data-poor bycatch assemblages. The method estimates fishing impact and compares the impact to sustainability reference points based on basic life-history parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by assessing the impact of Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) on the sustainability of 51 elasmobranch bycatch species. We estimated the proportion of the population distributed within trawled areas, from detection–nondetection data collected from scientific surveys. This estimate of species’ abundance was then included in a model incorporating catch rate and escapement probability to give an estimate of the fishing mortality rate of each species. To guide management of bycatch species, we established two reference points based on natural mortality rate and growth rate: maximum sustainable fishing mortality and minimum unsustainable fishing mortality. The proportion of the 51 species’ populations distributed within the fished area ranged between 0.02 and 1.00 (mean 0.36±S.D. 0.31). Our results indicated that fishing impacts may have exceeded the maximum sustainable fishing mortality for 19 species, and exceeded the minimum unsustainable fishing mortality for 9 species. However, the estimates were highly uncertain for some species. SAFE can also be used by scientists and fishery managers to focus monitoring programs on potentially at-risk species to obtain additional data for further sustainability evaluation. Because the framework of SAFE is compatible with the management of target species, it can be incorporated into existing fishery management strategies, and may fulfill emerging ecosystem-based fishery management objectives.

AB  - Assessment of ecological sustainability for all species impacted by fishing is one of the most important and practical steps towards an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries. We extend methods for Sustainability Assessment for Fishing Effects (SAFE) to assess diverse bycatch species in a multi-sector and multi-gear fishery. We develop methods for estimating fishing mortality rate, based on limited data, for demersal trawl, Danish seine, gillnet, and longline. The general approach involves estimating spatial overlap between species distribution and fishing effort distribution, catchability resulting from probability of encountering the gear and size-dependent selectivity, and post-capture mortality. We define three reference points (Fmsm, Flim, and Fcrash) and use six methods to derive these reference points. As an example, we apply this method to nearly 500 fish species caught in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery, a multi-sector and multi-gear fishery in Australia. We assess sustainability risk for all captured fish species in each sub-fishery and the cumulative impact across all the sub-fisheries. The results indicate that chondrichthyans are more vulnerable to fishing impact than teleosts, and that impact differs among sectors of the fishery. This method could be easily applied to other fisheries. However, the results may require fine tuning by other means such as expert judgment.
