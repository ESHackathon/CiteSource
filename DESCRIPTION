Description: This package was developed in order to provide researchers the ability to 
             examine the utility and efficacy of literature resources and search 
             methodologies. The package provides users with the ability to deduplicate
             references while maintaining customizable metadata. The resulting data 
             can be analyzed using predeveloped plots and tables, including a summary 
             table. Users are also able to export and reimport data in .ris, and csv. 
             files. The package includes a shiny application for interactive use.
